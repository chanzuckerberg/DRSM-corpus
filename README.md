# DRSM-corpus

An annotated literature corpus for NLP studies of 'Disease Research State' based on different categories of research (`DRSM` stands for `Disease Research State Model`). This corpus reflects our current state of manually-curated research data for this task combined with curation instructions and details about the curation process.

## How was this dataset collected? How has it been processed?:
The corpus was generated by manually curating titles and abstracts of primary research papers that were queried from the CZIF's knowledge graph based on searches for disease names and synonyms. The classification scheme was devised in house in consultation with external experts from external ontologies, rare disease organizations, drug companies, and other CZI team members (and is undergoing revision as we progress with this work). Curation as performed by members of the CZIF Curation team.

**Status:** Note that this project is under rapid evolution and development and should be considered `Unstable` _(Early, active development, and may lack sufficient end-user documentation, assistance, etc., for anything other than the earliest adopters)_.

## Getting Started

We provide access to a corpus of primary research articles expressed as several `*.tsv` files:

We perform in-house curation to define an 'initial_gold standard' set with the following columns: 

* ID_PAPER - The PubMed Identifier of the paper 
* TITLE - The title of the paper
* ABSTRACT - The abstract of the paper
* PRIMARY CATEGORY - The category designated to indicate the primary contribution of the paper (based on our in-house curation scheme). 
* SECONDARY CATEGORY - The category indicating a secondary role of the paper (based on our in-house curation scheme). 
* IRRELEVANT - boolean tag that denotes if this paper is a primary research article (not a review or a conference report, etc)
* DISEASE_NAME - Name of the disease queried from Meta's paper repository

The codes are intended to reflect the foci of the paper in terms of the primary research being performed. 

[See this wiki page for the latest categorization used to denote different classes of disease research paper.](../../wiki/Category-Model)  

Note - due to the complexity of this model, we are restricting ourselves to a subset of categories in our initial work, see [this wiki page](../../wiki/Initial-Curation-Task) .

## We include all available curated data for provenance and transparency

We provide access to all curated data being used. This includes data taken across multiple curators within a team, filtered for consensus, and then checked and edited by a senior curator. This data is available as a `*.tsv` file (labeled 'raw_data'), with the same columns as above with three additional data columns:  

* CURATOR - An anonymized code for each curator / checker  
* COMMENTS - Curation comments for this task  
* TIMESTAMP - The date + time that the CATEGORY score for this record was entered

## Amplified Curation Output 

Following our in-house curation, we use the service provided by [`Centaur Labs`](https://centaurlabs.com/) to scale up curation for these categories. This provides a 'labeled' dataset with the following columns. 

* ID_PAPER - The PubMed Identifier of the paper
* LABELING_STATE - `Gold Standard` if label generated from our in-house team, `Labeled` if generated by CentaurLabs annotators. 
* COMMENTS - Any comments entered by CentaurLabs annotators.
* EXPLANATION - Explanations for gold standard labels provided by our in-house team. 
* PRIMARY_CATEGORY - Primary category as described above. 
* AGREEMENT - A score from 0.0-1.0 showing how much agreement there was for the label from CentaurLab annotators.
* TRIMMED_TEXT - the title / abstract of the paper trimmed to 400 words, preserving the article title and trailing text of the abstract.  

## Extending Curation to additional categories 

We are working on extending the number of categories curated under this scheme by curating `binary` data (i.e., identifying whether a paper belongs to a rarer category). We include this data for completeness but have not yet developed downstream processing for it.
