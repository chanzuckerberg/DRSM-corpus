# DRSM-corpus

An annotated literature corpus for NLP studies of 'Disease Research State' based on different categories of research (`DRSM` stands for `Disease Research State Model`). This corpus reflects our current state of manually-curated research data for this task combined with curation instructions and details about the curation process.

## Getting Started

We provide access to a single corpus of primary research articles consisting of PubMed identifiers (`pmid`) with (A) one-or-more codes that are intended to designate the high-level type of research being performed in the paper (`codes`), and (B) MONDO URIs that designate a specific disease (see https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo) with the accompanying disease name (`MONDO_URI`, `Disease`). We include an additional column to denote irrelevant papers (i.e., papers that were included in the curation corpus but were excluded because they were off-topic, or were review articles: `irrelevant`). 

The codes are intended to reflect the primary foci of the paper in terms of the primary research being performed.
