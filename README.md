# DRSM-corpus

An annotated literature corpus for NLP studies of 'Disease Research State' based on different categories of research (`DRSM` stands for `Disease Research State Model`). This corpus reflects our current state of manually-curated research data for this task combined with curation instructions and details about the curation process.

## How was this dataset collected? How has it been processed?:
The corpus was generated by manually curating titles and abstracts of primary research papers that were queried from the CZIF's [Meta](https://meta.org/)’s  knowledge graph based on searches for disease names and synonyms. The classification scheme was devised in house in consultation with external experts from external ontologies, rare disease organizations, drug companies, and other CZI team members (and is undergoing revision as we progress with this work). Curation as performed by members of the CZIF Meta team.

**Status:** Note that this project is in it's very early stages and should be considered `Unstable` _(Early, active development, and may lack sufficient end-user documentation, assistance, etc., for anything other than the earliest adopters)_.

## Getting Started

We provide access to a corpus of primary research articles expressed as a single `*.tsv` file ([curated_data.tsv](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/DRSM-corpus/blob/main/curated_data.tsv)) with the following columnns:

* PMID - The PubMed Identifier of the paper 
* TITLE - The title of the paper
* ABSTRACT - The abstract of the paper
* CATEGORIES - a comma-delimited set of categories used to classify the paper
* IRRELEVANT - boolean tag that denotes if this paper is a primary research article (not a review or a conference report, etc)
* DISEASE_NAME - Name of the disease queried from Meta's paper repository
* URI - MONDO URI of the disease being characterized (see https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo, reused under CC  

The codes are intended to reflect the primary foci of the paper in terms of the primary research being performed.

### Current Category Model

The categories that are currently included as targets for the document classification work:

**General Aspects**
* `0.1. Disease Nomenclature` - _a paper defining a new disease nomenclature_
* `0.2. Related Diseases` - _a paper where the focus is on relationships between diseases (comorbidity, etc)_

**Clinical Aspects**
* `1.1. Clinical Characteristics` - _A paper that describes symptoms, signs, or ‘phenotype’ of a disease that would be presented to a physician in a clinic without extensive tests for pathology. _
* `1.2. Quality of Life (QOL)` - _A study describing patient experience or outcomes such as survival times, impact on mobility and other measures used to denote how the disease affects the patient’s quality of life._
* `1.3. Disease Pathology` - _A paper describing evidence of (A) how disease damages tissues or impairs the function of patients’ bodies in a clinical context. This text may  involve descriptions of clinical tests; (B) Text describing work that concerns the act of diagnosis (i.e., identifying a patients’ disease based on evidence from other sources);  (C) biomarkers for specific molecular signals that signify the presence of a disease._
* `1.4. Therapeutics in the Clinic` - _A study describing how treatments work in the clinic (but not in a clinical trial). 
_
* `1.5. Epidemiology` - _A study that describes (A) population-level incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health. (B) We also place statements related to the socioeconomic or economic costs of the disease/disease burden into this category. (C) Studies focussed on developing registries or large-scale datasets that address this question should also be placed into this category._
* `1.6. Influence of Geography or the Environment` - _A study that describes (A) geographic aspects of populations of patients suffering from the disease under study; (B) the influence of the physical environment on aspects of the disease (including transmission, risk factors, etc)._

**Basic Science Aspects**
* `2.1. Disease Mechanisms` - _A study that describes either (A) mechanistic involvement of specific genes in disease (deletions, gain of function, etc); (B) how molecular signalling or metabolism (binding, activating, phosphorylation, concentration increase, etc.) are involved in the mechanism  of a disease; or (C) the physiological mechanism of disease at the level of tissues, organs, and body systems._
* `2.2. Normal Biology` - _A paper that describes normal function of biological systems as the overall goal of a given study._
* `2.3. Non-in-vivo human or non-human Model System` - _A paper that describes basic-science experimental models that are not based on in-vivo studies of humans._
* `2.4. Basic Research Involving Human Subjects` - _Basic-science papers that are primarily focussed on developing new methods that are based on in-vivo studies of humans._
* `2.5. Computational Biology and Informatics research` - _A paper where the primary contribution is the development or application of computational methods_. 

**Translational Aspects**
* `3.1. Therapeutic Hypothesis` - _A study where a significant contribution of the paper is to put forward a new hypothesize for how basic science findings could lead  to the development of therapeutic or diagnostic methods._
* `3.2. Drug Mechanism` - _A paper describing any drugs’ pharmaceutical activity - including sites of potential (or actual) pharmaceutical intervention, mechanisms of action, metabolism, etc._
* `3.3. Preclinical Therapeutics` - _Studies describing analysis of possible therapy in laboratory-based non-human subjects._
* `3.4. Patient-Driven Therapeutics` - _Studies describing the following scenarios involving human subjects (A) Clinical trials (studies of therapeutic measures being used on patients in a clinical trial); (B) Post Marketing Drug Surveillance (effects of a drug after approval in the general population or as part of ‘standard healthcare’); (C) Drug repurposing (how a drug that has been approved for one use is being applied to a new disease)._  

### Categories of interest to be added in later iterations 
* `Patient Data` - studies that involve the creation of a new data resource
* `Health Disparities` - studies that focus on unequal delivery of health care to different populations based on race, gender, or other categories.
* `Natural Resistance to Disease` - studies highlighting natural resilience
* `Prevention` - the majority of rare diseases are genetic and cannot be 'prevented' (in the same way as infectious disease), but this remains an important category.
