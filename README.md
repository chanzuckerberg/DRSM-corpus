# DRSM-corpus

An annotated literature corpus for NLP studies of 'Disease Research State' based on different categories of research (`DRSM` stands for `Disease Research State Model`). This corpus reflects our current state of manually-curated research data for this task combined with curation instructions and details about the curation process.

## How was this dataset collected? How has it been processed?:
The corpus was generated by manually curating titles and abstracts of primary research papers that were queried from the CZIF's [Meta](https://meta.org/)â€™s  knowledge graph based on searches for disease names and synonyms. The classification scheme was devised in house in consultation with external experts from external ontologies, rare disease organizations, drug companies, and other CZI team members (and is undergoing revision as we progress with this work). Curation as performed by members of the CZIF Meta team.

**Status:** Note that this project is in it's very early stages and should be considered `Unstable` _(Early, active development, and may lack sufficient end-user documentation, assistance, etc., for anything other than the earliest adopters)_.

## Getting Started

We provide access to a corpus of primary research articles expressed as a single `*.tsv` file ([curated_data.tsv](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/DRSM-corpus/blob/main/curated_data.tsv)) with the following columnns:

* PMID - The PubMed Identifier of the paper 
* TITLE - The title of the paper
* ABSTRACT - The abstract of the paper
* CATEGORIES - a comma-delimited set of categories used to classify the paper
* IRRELEVANT - boolean tag that denotes if this paper is a primary research article (not a review or a conference report, etc)
* DISEASE_NAME - Name of the disease queried from Meta's paper repository
* URI - MONDO URI of the disease being characterized (see https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo, codes are reused MONDO's CC-BY 4.0 licsense).  

The codes are intended to reflect the primary foci of the paper in terms of the primary research being performed.
