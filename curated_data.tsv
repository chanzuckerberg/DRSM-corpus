19403253	"Hereditary hemorragic telangiectasia and hepatic abcess
"	"We report the case of a 27-year-old man presenting with a hepatic abscess and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The association between HHT and an infectious disease seemed to be induced by arteriovenous malformations and maybe also by a deficit of polymorphonuclear cells, a monocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis. This diagnosis should be suggested in case of serious infections in young patients. Prevention is based on screening for and destroying infection, antibioprophylaxis and embolization of arteriovenous malformations.

20042635	"ALK5 phosphorylation of the endoglin cytoplasmic domain regulates Smad1/5/8 signaling and endothelial cell migration
"	"Endoglin, an endothelial cell-specific transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor, has an essential role in angiogenesis. Endoglin-null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype due to defects in angiogenesis and mutations in endoglin result in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I. Increased endoglin expression in the proliferating endothelium of tumors has been correlated with metastasis, tumor grade and decreased survival. Although endoglin is thought to regulate TGF-beta superfamily signaling in endothelial cells through regulating the balance between two TGF-beta-responsive pathways, the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad2/3 pathway and the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1/5/8 pathway, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis has not been defined. Here, we investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and its phosphorylation by ALK5 in regulating endoglin function in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin is basally phosphorylated by ALK5, primarily on serines 646 and 649, in endothelial cells. Functionally, the loss of phosphorylation at serine 646 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to TGF-beta and endothelial cell migration, whereas loss of phosphorylation at both serines 646 and 649 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to bone morphogenetic protein-9. Taken together, these results support endoglin phosphorylation by ALK5 as an important mechanism for regulating TGF-beta superfamily signaling and migration in endothelial cells.

20042709	"Spontaneous adult-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to increased endothelial oxidative stress in a murine model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

"	"To evaluate and describe pancreatic involvement by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) in patients with a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided informed consent. Across 12 months, all consecutive adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT referred to our pluridisciplinary HHT center for evaluation were enrolled prospectively in the study and underwent contrast material-enhanced multidetector CT of the abdomen. Pancreatic telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas were noted, and their characteristics were described. Genetic mutation was also investigated. Thirty-five patients (19 women, 16 men; mean age, 48.4 years) were included. All patients were asymptomatic. A genetic mutation was identified in 28 (80%) patients, including endoglin in 16 (57%), activin type-II-like receptor kinase 1 (ALK1) in 11 (39%), and SMAD4 in one (4%). Eleven (31%) patients exhibited pancreatic involvement. Fifty-four percent of patients with ALK1 mutation had pancreatic involvement. Twenty-three pancreatic telangiectases were identified during the arterial phase in nine patients. Seven pancreatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified in four patients. Pancreatic involvement commonly is found in patients with HHT (31% in our study), mainly in patients with ALK1 mutation; pancreatic telangiectases or AVMs are only diagnosed duringthe arterial phase at multidetector CT.

20224041	"Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin
"	"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation. Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM. In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina. Endoglin-deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs. Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.

"	"Hypoxic (ischemic) hepatitis generally requires the concurrence of an underlying condition which chronically exposes the liver to some degree of hypoxia (for example, congestive heart failure) combined with a triggering event (for example, arrhythmia) which further decreases the oxygen supply. We report a case of hypoxic hepatitis in which hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber's disease) constituted this underlying condition and gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the triggering event. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypoxic hepatitis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with the exception of therapeutic ligation or embolization of the hepatic artery so as to decrease shunting of liver blood. Hemodynamic mechanisms are proposed to explain this particular outcome.

"	"To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of transcatheter embolotherapy for treating sporadic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) that were not associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Between January 2001 and June 2008, thirty-five sporadic PAVMs were detected in 23 patients. The clinical follow up consisted of assessing the changes of the signs and symptoms of the PAVMs, and radiological evaluation with chest radiographs or chest CT scans. The lower lung regions (63%) and peripheral locations (86%) were the common locations of the PAVMs. Thirty-four PAVMs (97%) had simple architecture (one arterial feeder within a single pulmonary segment). Technical success was achieved in 33 PAVMs (94%); two cases of technical failure were due to catheterization failure (n = 1) and too large a feeding artery (17 mm) that disabled embolotherapy (n = 1). Coils and Amplatz vascular plugs were used in 30 and three PAVMs, respectively. Inadvertent placement of one coil (n = 1) and pulmonary infarction (n = 1) occurred, but no relevant symptoms developed. For the 13 patients with available data, the mean arterial O(2) saturation changed significantly from 92% to 98%. Complete or near-complete involution of the sac was observed in 30 of the 33 embolized PAVMs (91%). In these 33 embolized PAVMs, the mean sac diameter significantly decreased from 17.83 mm to 0.68 mm. Sporadic PAVMs are mostly the simple type with predominance in the lower lobe and peripheral locations. Transcatheter embolotherapy with coils or Amplatz vascular plugs is a safe and effective treatment for sporadic PAVMs and this provides excellent functional and radiological improvement.

20620301	"Primary lung tumors in children and adolescents: a 90-year experience
"	"Primary lung tumors in children are rare. A wide range of histopathologic tumor types occurs. The incidence of these lesions and their outcomes are still largely unknown. This study aims to determine the incidence of different primary lung tumors in children and to contribute data leading to the development of evidence-based treatment models. A single institution retrospective review was performed with institutional review board approval. Patients were included if they had primary, nonhematologic lung tumors. Simple squamous papillomas subjected to endoscopic biopsy and not resected, and vascular lesions associated with multisystem lesions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, were excluded. Medical records and pathologic material for patients from 1918 to 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients were identified (23 boys, 17 girls) with a mean age of 9.6 years (range, 3 months to 19 years). Fourteen distinct histopathologic tumor types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. Chemotherapy was used in 23% (9) and radiation in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.

A contrast echocardiogram demonstrated a patent foramen ovale (PFO). She was found to be positive for the Factor V Leiden mutation. The PFO was closed percutaneously. However, a substantial right to left shunt of 14% persisted. Pulmonary angiography revealed multiple arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) and she was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The AVMs were embolized and she has had no further cerebral events. Interestingly, her episodes of 'migraine' have also improved dramatically following the closure of the PFO and the embolization of the AVMs. This case demonstrates the complex relationship between right to left shunts, cryptogenic stroke and migraine.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.

21310938	"Immunosuppressor FK506 increases endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression and modulates transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in endothelial cells
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Patients show severe epistaxis, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency. No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies. We report the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression. The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after hepatic failure due to a liver arteriovenous malformation. The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection. After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external telangiectases, epistaxes, and anemia disappeared. Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation.

In 32 successive patients presenting with recurrent HHT epistaxis 25-100 mg of Bevacizumab was applied intranasally either as a submucosal injection or as a topical spray between November 2008 and May 2010. In many of the injected patients, the Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment efficacy. All 32 treated patients were contacted with pre- and posttreatment epistaxis severity scores (ESS) compared. Seventeen patients received topical Bevacizumab, 10 patients received a submucosal injection, and 5 patients received both. In addition, 12 patients were also treated with the KTP laser at the time of their submucosal injection. In the pretreatment period the average ESS was 7.0 (SD = 2.1), whereas in the posttreatment group the average ESS was 2.9 (SD = 1.7).

Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well.

"	"Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Between June 2004 and January 2008, 14 patients with HHT underwent embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches due to severe epistaxis. There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization.

Three patients in whom arterial spasm was observed, suffered from facial paraesthesia lasting for 3-5 days after embolization. Out of 14 patients, 12 were available for 24-month follow-up evaluation. All except one claimed reduction in frequency and severity of epistaxis which had a positive impact on their quality of life. Endovascular embolization of epistaxis in patients with HHT is an effective and safe procedure although it cannot provide a long-term cure in most cases. Embolization reduces the frequency, severity and duration of nasal bleeding in patients with HHT, improving patients' quality of life.

21855727	"Cutaneous signs of systemic disease
"	"Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

"	"Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.

This was a single-center study of children who underwent baseline screening for PAVMs using both TTCE and chest computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of HHT. The CT and TTCE results were prospectively reviewed independently by 2 radiologists and 2 cardiologists blinded to the study results. Both intraobserver and interobserver agreement for interpreting TTCE results were excellent (κ = 0.97 and 0.92, respectively) and higher than the interobserver agreement for CT interpretation (κ = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of TTCE to predict PAVMs were 1 and 0.82, respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 0.39 and 1, respectively. TTCE is a sensitive test for PAVMs in children with suspected HHT and can be a useful initial screening tool in pediatric HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. The patient was treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months. Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular development resulting in direct connections between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing capillaries. Symptoms and signs can appear throughout life and marked intrafamilial variability confounds diagnosis based purely on clinical criteria. We set out to determine the impact of genetic testing on the cost of screening for HHT in at-risk relatives. We performed economic modeling of idealized pedigrees following two scenarios: repeated clinical screening until an HHT diagnosis could be either affirmed or excluded, and mutation testing in the proband, followed by genetic testing of at-risk relatives and clinical monitoring of only those relatives who test positive for the familial mutation. Based on actual reimbursement data from our region's largest health insurer, the molecular diagnostic model saved over $22,000 for a family with four relatives at risk for the initial diagnostic work-up. For a cohort of 100 probands, the total savings for the molecular diagnostic model over a reasonable period of follow-up was greater than $9 million. In this idealized setting in which all probands and at-risk relatives accepted molecular testing, the economic advantages of genetic screening over repeated clinical screening are substantial.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes. A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.

22421041	"ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway
"	"Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

22622516	"BMP9 induces EphrinB2 expression in endothelial cells through an Alk1-BMPRII/ActRII-ID1/ID3-dependent pathway: implications for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type II
"	"ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.

And the patients were diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic analyzed criteria of HHT, the ACVRL1 gene screened and the conservation of mutation protein. Three probands and 1 patient were diagnostic for HHT and 2 patients were suspected. In family I, there was a missense mutation of ACVRL1 gene in c.287A > G on 2 patients, leading to the transferal of amino acids from Asn to Ser at 96(th) place. In family II, there was a missense mutation of c.1271C > T on ACVRL1 in 2 patients, leading to the transfer of amino acids from Pro to Leu at 424(th) place. In family III, there was a deletion mutation of c.147delC on ACVRL1 so as to produce only the former 53 amino acids of ALK1 protein. Through an analysis of multi-species conservation, the mutations were conserved between multiple species. By querying the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, we confirmed that the mutation was not of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genetic screening of HHT patients may identify their virulence gene. And genetic screening of their offspring is helpful for the early diagnosis and prevention before disease onset.

"	"BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicate BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation.

While this procedure results in loss of smell and permanent nasal obstruction, proponents note significant improvement in patient symptomatology. Case report. A 70-year-old female with a history of HHT presented to an outside hospital with bleeding into the nasopharynx 2 months after undergoing a modified Young's procedure at an unaffiliated institution. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and transferred to our facility. Due to persistent epistaxis and need for airway protection, the patient was intubated and her throat was packed. She also developed aspiration pneumonia and hypotensive shock requiring vasopressors. Twenty-four hours following bilateral internal maxillary and sphenopalatine artery embolization, she developed significant epistaxis requiring reversal of the Young's procedure on the left and placement of an anterior-posterior pack at the bedside.

23675457	"Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.

We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and identified turbulent thrombi in one of the PAVMs that were capable of circulating systemically and inducing embolic strokes. The condition of the patient improved immediately following VATS. This case suggests that VATS may be a preferred therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with PAVM accompanying recurrent episodes of life-threatening complications such as strokes.

24268183	"VarRanker: rapid prioritization of sequence variations associated with human disease
"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

24273414	"Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted. The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years. Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.

She was found to have atypical atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Radiofrequency ablation was planned, but inferior vena cava interruption precluded right atrial (RA) access. The RA was then accessed through both subclavian veins, and activation mapping revealed a dense atriotomy scar in the posterolateral inferior RA. Wavefront propagation proceeded caudally through an area of slow conduction confined by the atriotomy scar. Atypical atrial flutter terminated during a second radiofrequency application to an isthmus confined by 2 regions of dense scar. The arrhythmia did not recur, although the patient later experienced typical atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. High-output heart failure due to systemic arteriovenous shunt was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and improved markedly with bevacizumab therapy.

"	"To identify whether relationships exist between epistaxis and migraines in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), to potentially provide further preventative and therapeutic options for the debilitating nosebleeds that are often very difficult to manage in clinical practice. Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. 4.

24489709	"ENDOGLIN is dispensable for vasculogenesis, but required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis
"	"ENDOGLIN (ENG) is a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members that is highly expressed in endothelial cells and has a critical function in the development of the vascular system. Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

"	"To describe pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a retrospective descriptive study of women with HHT (18-55 years of age) from the Toronto HHT Database using a telephone questionnaire regarding pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) play an important role in vascular repair and regeneration. This study was designed to examine the function of CACs derived from patients with HHT. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients with HHT and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed for expression of CD34, CD133 and VEGF receptor 2 by flow cytometry. PBMNCs were cultured to procure early outgrowth CACs. Development of endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in CACs was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CAC apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V staining, and CAC migration assessed by a modified Boyden chamber assay. mRNA expression of endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVLR1 or ALK1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in CACs was measured by real time RT-PCR. The percentage of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs from HHT patients was significantly higher than in PBMNCs of healthy controls. CACs derived from patients with HHT not only showed a significant reduction in EC-selective surface markers following 7-day culture, but also a significant increase in the rate of basal apoptosis and blunted migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. CACs from HHT patients expressed significantly lower levels of ENG, ALK1 and eNOS mRNAs. In conclusion, CACs from patients with HHT exhibited various functional impairments, suggesting a reduced regenerative capacity of CACs to repair the vascular lesions seen in HHT patients.

Forty-two patients from the HHT database with a definite clinical or genetic diagnosis of HHT with epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding and receiving TXA were included, and their Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), blood transfusions, and hospitalizations prior to and during TXA use were assessed. Among the 42 patients, 29 responded to the questionnaire (78.3 %). The ESS declined from a mean of 6.9 ± 2.7 to 4.3 ± 2.2 (p < 0.001), and there was a reduction in the percentage of patients receiving blood transfusion from 55.2 to 37.9 % (p = 0.095), hospitalizations from 58.6 to 37.9 % (p = 0.08), and medical care for epistaxis (i.e., clinic and/or emergency room visit) from 66.7 to 25.9 %. There was no difference in thrombosis (6.8 % before and during TXA use). TXA appears effective in the treatment of bleeding in patients with HHT, based on retrospective data.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.

"	"Cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are well known respectively by doctors. However, there are few cases that a single patient suffers both cerebral AVM and pulmonary AVM. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is universally accepted as an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which represents telangiectasia is frequently multiple AVMs in internal organs. Very few non-HHT cases were diagnosed as cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We report one case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs diagnosed as non-HHT to share our experience. This report aims to find the way of identifying non-HHT case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs in early periods. To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.

"	"HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.

"	"Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease. Early diagnosis is important to avoid complications from vascular lesions, but diagnosis is difficult in asymptomatic patients. A 69-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of hepatic vascular malformations. He had mild anemia with iron deficiency, and dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant arteriovenous and arterioportal shunts throughout the liver. Telangiectasia from the pharynx to the duodenum was confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient history revealed episodes of epistaxis as well as a family history of epistaxis. He was diagnosed with HHT, although no other family member had been diagnosed with definite HHT. A diagnosis of HHT must be considered in patients with hepatic vascular malformations.

"	"A subset of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develops pulmonary hypertension (PH) by mechanisms including pulmonary arterial hypertension, high flow, and elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare clinical condition with abnormal direct communication between the branches of pulmonary artery and vein. It may occur as an isolated anomaly or in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Although these vascular pulmonary pathologies are quite uncommon, they are the important part of the differential diagnosis of common pulmonary problems such as hypoxemia and pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis of PAVM in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is a disorder that affects 1:5000-1:10,000 people worldwide, with an estimated 60,000 affected individuals in the USA. Approximately 50 % of patients with HHT experience potentially life-threatening health complications such as stroke, brain abscess, or heart failure. However, the most common symptom is spontaneous and frequent nosebleeding. HHT is a hereditary condition with significant health consequences, but little is known about how individuals cope with HHT on a daily basis and how individuals share information about the disorder with social groups outside of the family. The objectives of this study were to improve understanding of the daily experiences of patients with diagnosed HHT and to investigate how they disclose their diagnosis to various social groups (friends, dating partners, employers, and coworkers) outside of their biological family. Adult patients seen at a university HHT clinic and who had been diagnosed with HHT for at least 6 months were recruited by mail. Participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 19). A qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts identified four major categories: (1) the emotional impact of HHT, (2) the social impact of HHT, (3) concerns for current and future health related to HHT, and (4) social context drives disclosure of HHT. Participants reported that although HHT was a manageable hereditary disorder, the symptoms negatively affected their daily life. It is important for health care providers to understand how individuals with rare genetic disorders are managing.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials. 4.

"	"The aim of this study was to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) as a screening test for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This retrospective study included suspected patients with HHT who were screened for PAVM with a TCD and a chest computed tomography (CT) study. The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.

Symptoms of HHT can be present in individuals who test negative for mutations in these three genes indicating other genes may be involved. In this study, we tested for mutations in two genes, RASA1 and GDF2, which were recently reported to be involved in vascular disorders. To determine whether RASA1 and GDF2 have phenotypic overlap with HHT and should be included in diagnostic testing, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to detect mutations in 93 unrelated individuals who previously tested negative for mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, but were clinically suspected to have HHT. Pathogenic mutations in RASA1 were identified in two samples (2.15%) and a variant of unknown significance in GDF2 was detected in one sample. All three individuals experienced epistaxis with dermal lesions described in medical records as telangiectases. These results indicate that the inclusion of RASA1 and GDF2 screening in individuals suspected to have HHT will increase the detection rate and aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis.

The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.

"	"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. She denied any symptoms except recurrent epistaxis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. We performed open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.

In HHT patients with initial negative screening echocardiogram, 60% recommended repeat screening contrast echocardiogram in 5 years, while 15% felt that no additional screening was necessary in these patients. Fifty-nine percentage reported never having seen a patient with initial negative contrast echocardiogram become positive. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms, 41% recommended contrast-enhanced CT as the next step in management, 22% recommended non-contrast CT, and 22 and 3% recommended repeat echocardiogram in 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms but no visible PAVMs, opinions regarding the use of bubble filters were evenly divided, while 79% recommended prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive procedures. Eighty percentages of respondents treat PAVMs with feeding artery less than 3 mm, and 52% treat feeders less than 2 mm. Regarding follow-up, 71% reported seeing PAVM recurrence at the site of a previously completely treated PAVM. There is inconsistency in practice regarding PAVM screening, management, and follow-up, suggesting a need for further research and guideline development.

"	"Endoglin (ENG)/CD105 is an essential endothelial cell co-receptor of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) and involved in tumor angiogenesis and preeclampsia. Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of human ENG and its complex with the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). BMP9 interacts with a hydrophobic surface of the N-terminal orphan domain of ENG, which adopts a new duplicated fold generated by circular permutation. The interface involves residues mutated in HHT1 and overlaps with the epitope of tumor-suppressing anti-ENG monoclonal TRC105. The structure of the C-terminal zona pellucida module suggests how two copies of ENG embrace homodimeric BMP9, whose binding is compatible with ligand recognition by type I but not type II receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the BMP signaling cascade, with implications for future therapeutic interventions in this fundamental pathway.

"	"Children with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) may have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, clubbing, cyanosis and hemoptysis. However, some patients with pulmonary AVMs may be asymptomatic, placing them at risk for complications such as stroke or brain abscess if they are not identified and treated. This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs. Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.

29080903	"Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions
"	"Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, we hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels due to mutations in specific genes that lead to angiogenesis errors. HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to obtain data on all hospital discharges occurring in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012. The association between admission age and HHT-related complications and outcomes were studied. 10293 hospitalizations in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012 were included. Patients > 50 accounted for 77% of all admissions with 30% of admissions occurring in the 51-65 age group. Bleeding related complications were the most frequent (62.7%,n= 6455 hospitalizations), followed by cardiovascular (41%,n= 4216), neurological (12.4%,n= 1276), and hepatobiliary (6.4%,n= 660) complications. Patients older than 50 accounted for 83% of bleeding events, 90% of cardiovascular events, 58% of neurologic events, and 81% of hepatobiliary events. The vast majority (83%) of medical and surgical procedures were performed in those older than 50 years of age. Older patients also experienced higher rates of death. Aging has significant adverse impacts on rates of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes amongst HHT patients in the United States.

Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as epistaxis. Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH. Recently, it was shown that tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.

Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.

In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

Capsule endoscopy (CE) is emerging as a safe and non-invasive alternative for small intestinal evaluation, but its diagnostic yield and utility in diagnosing small bowel AVMs in HHT patients are understudied. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the utility of CE for diagnosing AVMs in HHT patients. Methods  A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature on CE in HHT patients identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2018 were conducted. Summary effects were estimated using a random effects model. Results  After applying exclusion criteria, five studies (n = 124 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic yield for visualization of small bowel AVMs by CE was 77.0 % (95 % CI 65.8 - 85.4 %, P  < 0.001). Conclusions  CE has a good diagnostic yield for small bowel AVMs in HHT.

Anti-angiogenic drugs thalidomide and bevacizumab have been increasingly used off-label with variable results. The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs) classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001). Thalidomide AEs occurred at more similar rates in males (25 AEs in 41 men, 60.9%) and females (12 in 26 (46.2%), but were more common in ENG patients (17 in 17) than in ACVRL1 (14 in 34, p < 0.0001). For bevacizumab, the most common reports were of joint pains (7/69, 10%), headache (3/69, 4.4%) and proteinuria (2/69, 3%), and for thalidomide, peripheral neuropathy (12/67, 18%); drowsiness (8/67, 12%); and dizziness (6/67, 9%). Fatal adverse events were more common in males (p = 0.009), and in patients with ENG pathogenic variants (p = 0.012). One fatal AE was possibly related to bevacizumab (average incidence rate: 1.5 per 100 person-years); 3 fatal AEs were possibly related to thalidomide (average incidence rate: 4 per 100 person-years). With potential increase in use of Bevacizumab and Thalidomide in HHT patients, data presented support appropriate weighing of the toxicities which can arise in HHT settings and the practice recommendations for their prevention and management.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF), a vessel malformation connecting the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation while bypassing the pulmonary capillaries, can cause paradoxical cerebral infarction. It is often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic disease characterized by multiple dermal, mucosal, and visceral telangiectasia causing recurrent bleeding. Paradoxical cerebral embolism caused by PAVF without HHT is rare. Here, we report a patient with isolated PAVF who experienced an ischemic stroke caused by a paradoxical embolism from deep venous thrombosis; the patient was successfully treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. She presented with a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation to 91%, and lung disease was suspected. A PAVF was subsequently found in the right S6 region using contrast computed tomography. Interventional radiologists successfully occluded the shunt using 6 microcoils. PAVF should be considered when determining the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in patients with hypoxia, which can be the only symptom of PAVF.

31400083	"Variant analysis in Chinese families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Recurrent epistaxis is the primary complaint in 90%-96% of HHT patients and the other symptoms come with age. The aim of this study was to analyze HHT-associated gene variant spectrum in Chinese HHT patients and to assess whether genetic testing could contribute to the early diagnosis. Thirty one HHT families including 62 individuals were recruited. Variants in the coding regions of four genes involved in HHT were amplified and analyzed using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twenty unique variants, including 8 novel variants were found in 24 of the 31 (77.4%) kindred. Diagnosis is confirmed for 7 possible individuals from 6 kindred. Thirteen ACVRL1 variants were detected from 17 isolated HHT families. Variants in ACVRL1 from 8/17 (47.1%) families were located in exon8. Seven ENG variants were found in 7 unrelated families throughout the coding region. We conclude that ACVRL1 gene variant is 2.4 times more prevalent than that in ENG in Chinese individuals with HHT, and exon8 of the ACVRL1 gene may be a hotspot region. Genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis for HHT.

"	"The objective of this study was to report for the first time on the results of submucosal injections of bevacizumab used in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Retrospective analytic chart review. We performed a chart review that included all patients with HHT treated with intranasal bevacizumab and cyanoacrylate glue for refractory epistaxis at Lariboisiere University Hospital from 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. We injected 100 mg (25 mg/mL) of bevacizumab diluted in 2 mL of serum at the base of the telangiectasias, and sclerotherapy with an injection of cyanoacrylate glue was used adjunctively. Treatment efficacy was based on changes in Epistaxis Severity Scores (ESS) and the Bergler-Sadick Scale. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder (CL) and Likert scale, respectively. Thirty-one patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 26.6 months. The average ESS score significantly decreased from 7.82 to 3.89 (P < .05). The Bergler-Sadick score significantly improved (P < .05) following the treatment, including the frequency (from 2.74 to 1.64) and the quantity (from 2.54 to 1.51) scales. Quality of life was significantly improved (P < .05) using the CL score (from 4.16 to 7.22). The Likert satisfaction scale related to the treatment efficacy was high, with an average of 7.03 out of 10. No complications were noted. Submucosal injections of bevacizumab in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy significantly reduced epistaxis and improved the quality of life in HHT. Prospective comparative studies are needed to further evaluate the significance of this treatment modality. 3b Laryngoscope, 129:2210-2215, 2019.

31689244	"Correcting Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 treats pathology in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia models
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.

31828546	"BMP10-mediated ALK1 signaling is continuously required for vascular development and maintenance.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.

"	"We aimed to describe risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and endoscopic findings in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This is a prospective study from a referral HHT unit. Endoscopic tests were performed when there was suspicion of GI bleeding, and patients were divided as follows: with, without, and with unsuspected GI involvement. 67 (27.9%) patients with, 28 (11.7%) patients without, and 145 (60.4%) with unsuspected GI involvement were included. Age, tobacco use, endoglin (ENG) mutation, and hemoglobin were associated with GI involvement. Telangiectases were mostly in the stomach and duodenum, but 18.5% of patients with normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) had GI involvement in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Telangiectases ≤ 3 mm and ≤10 per location were most common. Among patients with GI disease, those with hemoglobin < 8 g/dL or transfusion requirements (65.7%) were older and had higher epistaxis severity score (ESS) and larger telangiectases (>3 mm). After a mean follow-up of 34.2 months, patients with GI involvement required more transfusions and more emergency department and hospital admissions, with no differences in mortality. Risk factors for GI involvement have been identified. Patients with GI involvement and severe anemia had larger telangiectases and higher ESS. VCE should be considered in patients with suspicion of GI bleeding, even if EGD is normal.

A randomized controlled trial was performed randomizing individual PAVMs to treatment with IDC versus Nester coils at the largest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center in Canada. The primary outcome was CT evidence of reperfusion at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural complications, fluoroscopy time and contrast volume. Our study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and subsequent expiration of funding. A total of 46 PAVMs in 25 patients (64% female) were included in our study; 26 randomized to Nester coils and 20 randomized to IDC. One patient was lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 421.2 ± 215.7 days, no significant difference in PAVM reperfusion was detected between Nester coils and IDC (0% vs. 5.6%, p > 0.05).

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral vascular malformations. Individuals suffering from HHT have a significantly increased risk of bacterial infections, but the mechanisms involved in this are not clear. White blood cell subpopulations were estimated with flow cytometry in 79 patients with HHT and 45 healthy individuals, and association with clinicopathological status was assessed. A prominent decrease in absolute numbers of T cells in HHT was revealed (0.7 (0.5-1.1) vs. 1.3 (0.8-1.6), 106/mL, p < 0.05), and in multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin level was associated with lymphopenia (OR = 0.625, 95% CI: 0.417-0.937, p < 0.05). Although no changes in absolute numbers of neutrophils and monocytes were observed, we revealed a significant impairment of neutrophil antibacterial functions in HHT (n = 9), compared to healthy individuals (n = 7), in vitro. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MOI10 was significantly suppressed in HHT (mean area per cell, mm2: 76 (70-92) vs. 121 (97-128), p < 0.05), due to impaired filamentous actin organization (% of positive cells: 69 (59-77) vs. 92 (88-94), p < 0.05). To conclude, this study reveals the categories of patients with HHT that are prone to immunosuppression and require careful monitoring, and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy based on the functional activation of neutrophils.

"	"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.

"	"Objective: To explore the value of right heart contrast echocardiography in etiological diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 patients who underwent transthoracic contrast echocardiography in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from May 2015 to July 2018, all of whom were diagnosed as PH by right heart catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups according to contrast echocardiography: the intra-cardiac shunt group (<4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); Intrapulmonary shunt group (>4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); non-shunt group. The etiology, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PO(2)), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central nervous system complications were also compared among the three groups. Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.

"	"Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Care delivery for HHT patients is impeded by the need for laborious, repeated phenotyping and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between causal DNA variants in ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4 and GDF2, and clinical manifestations. To address this, we analyzed DNA samples from 183 previously uncharacterized, unrelated HHT and suspected HHT cases using the ThromboGenomics high-throughput sequencing platform. We identified 127 rare variants across 168 heterozygous genotypes. Applying modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines, 106 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 21 as nonpathogenic (variant of uncertain significance/benign). Unlike the protein products of ACVRL1 and SMAD4, the extracellular ENG amino acids are not strongly conserved. Our inferences of the functional consequences of causal variants in ENG were therefore informed by the crystal structure of endoglin. We then compared the accuracy of predictions of the causal gene blinded to the genetic data using 2 approaches: subjective clinical predictions and statistical predictions based on 8 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Both approaches had some predictive power, but they were insufficiently accurate to be used clinically, without genetic testing. The distributions of red cell indices differed by causal gene but not sufficiently for clinical use in isolation from genetic data. We conclude that parallel sequencing of the 4 known HHT genes, multidisciplinary team review of variant calls in the context of detailed clinical information, and statistical and structural modeling improve the prognostication and treatment of HHT.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are pathologic low-resistance conduits between a pulmonary artery and vein. Over 80% PAVMs occur in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and result from mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway. Mutations in the Growth Differentiation Factor 2 (GDF2) gene have recently been described to result in a vascular-anomaly syndrome with phenotypic overlap with HHT. We report a 43-year-old woman with a PAVM related ischemic stroke who was subsequently found to have a novel GDF2 gene mutation. The patient underwent coil-embolization of the PAVM with stable clinical and radiographic follow-up. It is important to diagnose PAVMs as they are an important cause of stroke-in-young; and can be treated definitively, reducing risk of recurrent stroke and migraine.

"	"Epistaxis is a common debilitating manifestation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), due to mucocutaneous telangiectases. The epistaxis can be difficult to control despite available treatments. Dysregulated angiogenesis has been shown to be associated with telangiectases formation. Topical propranolol has demonstrated antiangiogenic properties. We performed a two-phase study, i.e., a double-blind placebo-controlled phase, followed by an open-label phase. The aim of the study was assessment of safety and efficacy of nasal propranolol gel in HHT-related epistaxis. Twenty participants with moderate-severe HHT-related epistaxis were randomized to eight weeks of propranolol gel 1.5%, or placebo 0.5 cc, applied to each nostril twice daily; and continued propranolol for eight weeks in an open-label study. For the propranolol group, the epistaxis severity score (ESS) improved significantly (-2.03 ± 1.7 as compared with -0.35 ± 0.68 for the placebo group, p = 0.009); hemoglobin levels improved significantly (10.5 ± 2.6 to 11.4 ± 2.02 g/dL, p = 0.009); and intravenous iron and blood transfusion requirement decreased. The change in nasal endoscopy findings was not significant. During the open-label period, the ESS score improved significantly in the former placebo group (-1.99 ± 1.41, p = 0.005). The most common adverse event was nasal mucosa burning sensation. No cardiovascular events were reported. Our results suggest that topical propranolol gel is safe and effective in HHT-related epistaxis.

"	"Epistaxis is the greatest cause of morbidity in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); because of this, a validated epistaxis-specific quality-of-life instrument for HHT should be made available. To develop and validate an epistaxis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure for HHT. This survey study focused on the development and validation of the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis (NOSE) in HTT (NOSE HHT) outcome measure with data prospectively collected from December 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. A total of 401 patients were recruited from within the Cure Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia online patient advocacy social media network, the Washington University HHT Center of Excellence, and a randomized clinical trial investigating an intranasal timolol gel for HHT-associated epistaxis. Face and content validity, factor analysis, internal consistency as measured through Cronbach α, construct validity, responsiveness to change, and minimal clinically important difference. The NOSE HHT was developed and validated with a possible score ranging discretely from 0 to 4 for each of the 29 items and a total score ranging continuously from 0 to 4 after dividing by the total number of items answered. A total of 401 participants completed the NOSE HHT. Factor analysis identified 3 factors that matched the a priori specified subgroups of particular aspects of life affected by HHT-associated epistaxis: physical problems (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.59 [0.83]), functional limitations (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.28 [0.84]), and emotional consequences (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.95 [1.02]). The instrument had high internal consistency with an overall Cronbach α of 0.960. Convergent validity determined the total NOSE HHT score to be a strong predictor of disease severity; total NOSE HHT score can be split up into the following epistaxis severity categories: mild (0-1), moderate (1.01-2), and severe (>2). The instrument was found to be sensitive to change, and the minimal clinically important difference for the total NOSE HHT score was 0.46. Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of fibrovascular tissue, transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. This rare disease can involve one or more organs and clinical manifestations interest several medical specialties. A review of recent literature and our clinical experience shows that COVID-19 pandemic greatly influences the autonomy and psychic sphere of patients with HHT, causing them further distress. Often patients affected by HHT experience a sense of loneliness due to the rarity of this pathology and COVID-19 pandemic adds a burden for them and their caregivers who have to face emotional experiences that interfere with personal, social and working functioning. Multidisciplinary approach and web-mediated counseling intervention could offer a valid and personalized support for patients affected by HHT and their caregivers during quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic.

"	"Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare idiopathic microangiopathy affecting superficial dermal blood vessels. It is characterized by asymptomatic, disseminated, telangiectatic macules that typically involve the extremities. We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with widespread telangiectasias of three years' duration on the upper extremities and abdomen. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy may be underdiagnosed as it is often mistaken for disorders that are morphologically very similar, including generalized essential telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis. The diagnosis of CCV is made histologically and findings feature dilated superficial dermal vessels with thickened walls containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive eosinophilic hyaline material. Effective treatment options for CCV have yet to be established and given its benign disease course, treatment may not be necessary. Pulsed dye laser can be offered to patients for cosmetic improvement but the extent of the disease makes complete lesion clearance challenging in most cases. Given the lesions were asymptomatic our patient declined all offered treatment modalities.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Untreated AVMs, especially in the lungs-pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)-can result in morbidity with a decreased life expectancy. We have investigated whether HHT patients, systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed, have a similar survival as persons without HHT. We included all individuals screened for HHT between 2004 and 2016 with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis (HHT group) or excluded diagnosis (non-HHT control group). The social security number was used to confirm status as dead or alive in December 2019. We included 717 HHT patients and 471 controls. There was no difference in survival between the HHT and the non-HHT control group. The HHT group had a life expectancy of 75.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.3-78.6), comparable to the control group (79.3 years, 95% CI 74.8-84.0, Mantel-Cox test: p = 0.29). In conclusion, the life expectancy of HHT patients systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed in an HHT center of excellence was similar compared to their controls, justifying systematic screening and treatment in HHT patients.

"	"This report addresses how patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and high output cardiac failure (HOCF) due to hepatic vascular malformations, should be evaluated and could be treated. HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.

33282178	"Autologous correction in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-endothelial cells to identify a novel pathogenic mutation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.

Records of patients with HHT, treated for epistaxis between 2000 and 2018 were analyzed. Treatment procedures carried out and their efficacy were extracted and analyzed. Forty-three records were evaluated. All patients were given nasal humidifying ointments, 93% required acute treatment with bipolar electrocautery, and 60% underwent atraumatic nasal packing. Recurrent cases were treated medically with tranexamic acid (26%), oestrogen (19%), and bevacizumab (2%). Laser photocoagulation was done in selected cases (40%) and if unsuccessful, septal dermoplasty was performed (2.3%). Endovascular embolization was reserved for life-threatening emergencies (7%).

"	"Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Distribution of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene in patients with PAH was compared with the HHT Mutation Database. At diagnosis, ACVRL1 mutation carriers were significantly younger (21.8 +/- 16.7 yr) than BMPR2 mutation carriers and noncarriers (35.7 +/- 14.9 and 47.6 +/- 16.3 yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). In seven of the nine patients from the French PAH Network, PAH diagnosis preceded manifestations of HHT. ACVRL1 mutation carriers had better hemodynamic status at diagnosis, but none responded to acute vasodilator challenge and they had shorter survival when compared with other patients with PAH despite similar use of specific therapies. ACVRL1 mutations in exon 10 were more frequently observed in patients with PAH, as compared with what was observed in the HHT Mutation Database (33.3 vs. 5%; P < 0.0001). ACVRL1 mutation carriers were characterized by a younger age at PAH diagnosis. Despite less severe initial hemodynamics and similar management, these patients had worse prognosis compared with other patients with PAH, suggesting more rapid disease progression.

From this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported epistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (OR 1.53, P < .001 for all). Risk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.

"	"Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, we collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.

A large shunt predicted treatable PAVMs in 55.8% of HHT1 relatives and 37.5% of HHT2 relatives. TTCE was positive in four (6%) of 63 persons without HHT. A pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in HHT1- compared with HHT2-related mutation carriers. Shunt grading is helpful to predict treatable PAVMs, particularly in the HHT2 group. TTCE is also positive in a small fraction of persons without HHT.

20209594	"Long-term outcome of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and severe hepatic involvement after orthotopic liver transplantation: a single-center study
"	"Hepatic involvement occurs in up to 74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and is characterized by a spectrum of arteriovenous malformations. Three different types of intrahepatic shunting may be present: hepatic artery to hepatic veins, hepatic artery to portal vein, and portal vein to hepatic vein. Hepatic involvement in HHT may lead to biliary ischemia, portal hypertension, or high-output cardiac failure (HOCF). Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as the only definitive curative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hepatic involvement due to HHT after OLT with respect to mortality, cardiac and hepatic status, epistaxis, and quality of life. Patients with HHT and severe hepatic vascular malformations who underwent OLT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit (LLTU) from 1993 to 2007 were followed at the LLTU and the French Reference Center for HHT. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. There were 13 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria of the study (12 women and 1 man). The mean age at the time of OLT was 51.8 years (range = 33-65 years). Indications for OLT were cardiac failure (n = 9), biliary necrosis (n = 2), both cardiac failure and biliary necrosis (n = 1), and hemobilia (n = 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 109 months (range = 1-200 months). Twelve patients (92.3%) are still alive. For the 9 patients with HOCF, the mean cardiac index decreased from 5.4 L/minute/m(2) before OLT to 3.0 L/minute/m(2) after OLT. No severe hepatic complications were observed after OLT. Nine of the surviving patients (75%) experienced dramatic improvements in epistaxis and quality of life, including an ability to undertake more physical activity. In conclusion, OLT is an important therapeutic option for patients with HHT who have severe hepatic involvement. In the reported cohort, the mortality after OLT for this indication was low.

20224041	"Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin
"	"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation. Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM. In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina. Endoglin-deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs. Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.

20414677	"Update on molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disease hallmarked by the development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Germline mutations in two genes, endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ACVRL1), have been implicated in this disease. This report describes molecular diagnosis in a consecutive series of 600 individuals with clinical features of HHT disease. Each coding exon and flanking intronic regions of ENG and ACVRL1 genes was sequenced. Exonic copy number was quantified in probands without a coding sequence mutation. Novel nonsynonymous variants were further analyzed to predict functional consequences. In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and haplotypes for the two genes were compared between individuals with and without mutations. The highest mutation detection rate (87% [95% CI 80.2-91.5]) was observed in probands who met all four Curacao criteria (epistaxis, telangiectases, AVMs and family history). More than 30% of identified mutations were novel; however, only 6% were variants of unknown significance. Determining the significance of novel mutations as related to disease presents additional challenges. Detection of multiple alterations in the same proband also requires careful evaluation for disease association. In conclusion, the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands in this group do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of these two genes. This suggests alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation or involvement of alternate loci, and it requires further investigation.

We report a case of hypoxic hepatitis in which hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber's disease) constituted this underlying condition and gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the triggering event. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypoxic hepatitis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with the exception of therapeutic ligation or embolization of the hepatic artery so as to decrease shunting of liver blood.

"	"To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of transcatheter embolotherapy for treating sporadic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) that were not associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Between January 2001 and June 2008, thirty-five sporadic PAVMs were detected in 23 patients. The clinical follow up consisted of assessing the changes of the signs and symptoms of the PAVMs, and radiological evaluation with chest radiographs or chest CT scans. The lower lung regions (63%) and peripheral locations (86%) were the common locations of the PAVMs. Thirty-four PAVMs (97%) had simple architecture (one arterial feeder within a single pulmonary segment). Technical success was achieved in 33 PAVMs (94%); two cases of technical failure were due to catheterization failure (n = 1) and too large a feeding artery (17 mm) that disabled embolotherapy (n = 1). Coils and Amplatz vascular plugs were used in 30 and three PAVMs, respectively. Inadvertent placement of one coil (n = 1) and pulmonary infarction (n = 1) occurred, but no relevant symptoms developed. For the 13 patients with available data, the mean arterial O(2) saturation changed significantly from 92% to 98%. Complete or near-complete involution of the sac was observed in 30 of the 33 embolized PAVMs (91%). In these 33 embolized PAVMs, the mean sac diameter significantly decreased from 17.83 mm to 0.68 mm. Sporadic PAVMs are mostly the simple type with predominance in the lower lobe and peripheral locations. Transcatheter embolotherapy with coils or Amplatz vascular plugs is a safe and effective treatment for sporadic PAVMs and this provides excellent functional and radiological improvement.

"	"Brain abscesses occur in 5 to 13 % of patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), more often present in Rendu-Osler-Weber disease or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of headache for 2 months before acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever. CT-scan and MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion. A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved. CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after coil embolization. He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A second embolization was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke.

Additional findings revealed anemia and an aneurysm in her central nervous system. During her hospital stay, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was diagnosed. After application of two antiplatelet drugs, the patient was scheduled for coronarography, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting. During her hospital stay, only a minor episode of epistaxis was observed. We conclude that anemization due to HTT may significantly accelerate the progress of ischemic heart disease, resulting in acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, coronarography preceded by routine application of two antiplatelet drugs seems not to increase the risk of hemorrhage in HHT patients complicated with myocardial infarction.

This study aims to determine the incidence of different primary lung tumors in children and to contribute data leading to the development of evidence-based treatment models. A single institution retrospective review was performed with institutional review board approval. Patients were included if they had primary, nonhematologic lung tumors. Simple squamous papillomas subjected to endoscopic biopsy and not resected, and vascular lesions associated with multisystem lesions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, were excluded. Medical records and pathologic material for patients from 1918 to 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients were identified (23 boys, 17 girls) with a mean age of 9.6 years (range, 3 months to 19 years). Fourteen distinct histopathologic tumor types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. Chemotherapy was used in 23% (9) and radiation in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.

Of the 502 individuals assessed in the center, 154 had hepatic vascular malformations and were the subject of the study; 198 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and without hepatic vascular malformations were the controls. Additionally, we report the response to treatment of patients with complicated hepatic vascular malformations. The 154 patients were included and followed for a median period of 44 months (range 12-181); of these, eight (5.2%) died from VM-related complications and 39 (25.3%) experienced complications. The average incidence rates of death and complications were 1.1 and 3.6 per 100 person-years, respectively.

Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well. Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

At the present time, only very few prospective trials have been performed, and many studies are based on patients' subjective assessment of the severity of epistaxis. This prospective study measures the objective effect of laser treatment in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis. We introduce an objective measure to assess the severity of epistaxis: the bleeding time (BT).

"	"Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

"	"Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia and severe, recurrent epistaxis is a common clinical phenotype associated with HHT. An intranasal treatment regime of diluted Avastin™ (Bevacizumab; recombinant humanized anti-vascular epithelial growth factor immunoglobin G1) using apulsatile nasal irrigator has proven efficacious in clinical practice. However, concerns regarding the stability of Avastin™ following dilution and prolonged storage in standard containers used for drug delivery, such as polyethylene bottles, have so far prevented a more widespread clinical use. Compatibility with the preservative benzalkonium chloride was also unknown. This study aimed at determining, whether dilution, prolonged refrigerated storage and the presence of the preservative benzalkonium chloride - as required for novel Avastin™ formulations - affected the biochemical and electrochemical properties of the drug. We performed a detailed biochemical and electrochemical analysis of Avastin™, including native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isoelectric focusing. We did not detect any evidence of degeneration or aggregation following dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage or from the presence of benzalkonium chloride. All biochemical and electrochemical properties of Avastin™ after dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage were undistinguishable from control. Our data provide important insight into the stability of Avastin™ and allow the consideration of novel Avastin™ formulations, including its use in a metered-dose nasal spray for the treatment of HHT and other applications.

The presentation, treatment and syndromes associated with pAVF in children are reported here. A pediatric database for pAVF was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%). Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh. Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.

We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with bilateral arteriovenous malformations, who was admitted to the emergency department with subacute dyspnoea and left thoracic pain. The clinical examination suggested a hemothorax. Pulmonary angiography was performed and showed an arteriovenous malformation in the left lower lobe. Embolisation was undertaken and at the same time a chest tube was inserted. Pus was evacuated leading to the final diagnosis of pleural empyema. Progress was good despite an episode acute respiratory distress due to a pulmonary embolism. Pleural empyema is rarely described in the context of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. In the case of pleural effusion this diagnosis should be considered even though hemothorax is more common.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in mainly the endoglin gene (ENG) or activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) gene (ACVRL1). We investigated the molecular basis of HHT in a Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation in ENG (c.38T>A, p.Leu13Gln) located in the signal peptide's hydrophobic core, but not in ACVRL1. In experiments in COS-1 cells, the Leu13Gln (L13Q) mutant endoglin appeared to be expressed as a precursor form, probably due to impaired protein processing. Flow cytometry analyses of the COS-1 cells transiently expressing recombinant endoglins revealed that the wild-type endoglin was detected on the cell surface, but the L13Q mutant was not. We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.

"	"Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited disease that occurs in approximately one in 5000 to 8000 people. Clinical diagnosis of HHT is made when a person presents three of the following four criteria: family history, recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years.

"	"ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.

These clinical findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of HHT. Embolization of pulmonary AVF decreased the frequency of migraine attacks during 2-year follow-up after the embolization. The frequency of migraine in patients with HHT is higher than that of general population as well as the prevalence of vertigo. Therefore, MWA and vertigo presented in the patient with HHT suggests that there is a common pathological mechanism of dysfunction of endothelial cells and R-L shunt, among HHT, MWA, and vertigo.

"	"A 38-year-old woman who suffered from migraine was admitted because of severe, worsening headache for 24 hours (dissimilar to the previous migraine attacks), with impaired vision and weakness of the right arm. Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded. Physicians should search for cutaneous or mucous teleangiectasias. Family screening and long-term follow-up according to international guidelines is recommended.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with a wide spectrum of vascular malformations (VMs) involving multiple organs. Nine to 16% of patients with HHT harbor brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can cause intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective was to study clinical manifestations of brain AVMs in patients with HHT and correlate these with the specific gene mutated. We reviewed records of 171 patients with HHT and brain AVMs. A history of ICH was found in 27% (41/152) patients, with a mean age of 26 ± 18 range, (0-68) years. All of patients with ICH were neurologically asymptomatic prior to ICH. Multiple brain AVMs were found in 23% (170/39) of patients on initial examination. Genetic test results were available in 109 (64%) patients. Mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 were present in 75 (69%), 18 (17%), and 2 (2%), respectively. A history of ICH was reported in 24% of patients with an ENG mutation and 27% of patients with an ACVRL1 mutation, with a mean age of 26 ± 16 (range, 2-50) and 18 ± 21 (0-48) years, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age at first brain AVM diagnosis, prevalence of ICH history, age at ICH, or other manifestations of brain AVMs were observed among gene groups. In conclusion, no evidence for differences in brain AVM characteristics was observed among HHT gene groups, although we cannot exclude clinically important differences. Larger studies are needed to further guide brain AVM screening decisions in patients with HHT.

"	"BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicate BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation.

"	"SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting multiple organ systems, with epistaxis being the most common manifestation. Multiple procedures have been used for the management of epistaxis in the setting of HHT, including closure of the anterior nares via a Young's procedure. While this procedure results in loss of smell and permanent nasal obstruction, proponents note significant improvement in patient symptomatology. Case report. A 70-year-old female with a history of HHT presented to an outside hospital with bleeding into the nasopharynx 2 months after undergoing a modified Young's procedure at an unaffiliated institution. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and transferred to our facility. Due to persistent epistaxis and need for airway protection, the patient was intubated and her throat was packed. She also developed aspiration pneumonia and hypotensive shock requiring vasopressors. Twenty-four hours following bilateral internal maxillary and sphenopalatine artery embolization, she developed significant epistaxis requiring reversal of the Young's procedure on the left and placement of an anterior-posterior pack at the bedside. Upon packing removal several days later in the operating room, she was noted to have significant bleeding that necessitated reversal of the Young's procedure on the right side to obtain adequate exposure and hemostasis. We report a case of significant, life-threatening epistaxis following a modified Young's procedure that requiring multiple transfusions, bilateral embolization, and ultimately reversal of the Young's procedure for control of epistaxis. Although recognized as a potential complication, to our knowledge this is the first report in the English literature of such a case.

Patients with severe iron or blood transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a Young's procedure in three otolaryngology HHT centers were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for postoperative epistaxis and subjective outcome. Forty-three patients underwent a Young's procedure for severe epistaxis and were observed for a mean of 34 months. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients and 30 of 36 patients (83%) experienced complete cessation of bleeding after the Young's procedure. Patients had a mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.68 g/dL after the procedure. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory score after surgery was 43.56. No patients requested a reversal of the procedure.

The patient was a 9-year-old girl born of non-consanguineous parents after a well-followed pregnancy with problem-free delivery at term. From birth, she had a tumefaction of the left side of the nose and the left half of the upper lip that gradually increased in size without obstructing the nasal orifice and bled easily. Examination revealed the presence of tumefaction of the left nostril and the left half of the upper lip projecting towards the contralateral side especially in the nose. It was soft and painless, with the presence at the surface of dull red keratotic papules of 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Examination of the nasal mucosa revealed the same appearance of papules. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare congenital malformation, the rarest of five types. Since its initial description in 1890, few cases have been reported. However, female predominance has been noted with a male/female sex ratio of 1/3. It appears to be due to a genetic mutation that is probably autosomal, but the site of which is still unknown. In view of the special features of this case, several diagnoses were suggested, including Rendu Osler's disease, superficial lymphangioma and verrucous angioma.

HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered an uncommon complication of HHT whose impact on the survival of these patients is currently unknown. From January 1995 to December 2008, 29 hospitalized patients with definite HHT were included and followed until January 2011. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. PH was classified according to echocardiographic probability. A CT angiogram was performed in 24 of the 29 patients with HHT and AVMs were detected in 16 of them (67%): hepatic in 58%, pulmonary in 33% and spinal in 3%; 37% had both pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 21 patients. PH was considered possible in 4 (14%) and probable in 9 (31%). The mean age at diagnosis was lower in patients with PH than in patients without PH (54±16.5 years vs 73±8.8 years, p=0.002).

We demonstrated previously that endoglin and ALK1 interact with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and affect its activation. Endothelial cells deficient in endoglin or ALK1 proteins show eNOS uncoupling, reduced NO, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we measured NO and H(2)O(2) levels in several organs of adult Eng and Alk1 heterozygous mice, to ascertain whether decreased NO and increased ROS production is a generalized manifestation of HHT. A significant reduction in NO and increase in ROS production were found in several organs, known to be affected in patients. ROS overproduction in mutant mice was attributed to eNOS, as it was L-NAME inhibitable. Mitochondrial ROS contribution, blocked by antimycin, was highest in liver while NADPH oxidase, inhibited by apocynin, was a major source of ROS in the other tissues. However, there was no difference in antimycin- and apocynin-inhibitable ROS production between mutant and control mice. Our results indicate that eNOS-derived ROS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and likely predisposes to disease manifestations in several organs of HHT patients.

Mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1 account for around 85% of cases, and 10% are large deletions and duplications. Here we present a large novel deletion in ACVRL1 gene and its molecular characterization in a 3 generation Italian family. We employed short tandem repeats (STRs) analysis, direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, and 'deletion-specific' PCR methods. STRs Analysis at ENG and ACVRL1 loci suggested a positive linkage for ACVRL1. Direct sequencing of this gene did not identify any mutations, while MLPA identified a large deletion. These results were confirmed and exactly characterized with a 'deletion-specific' PCR: the deletion size is 4,594 bp and breakpoints in exon 3 and intron 8 show the presence of short direct repeats of 7 bp [GCCCCAC]. We hypothesize, as causative molecular mechanism, the replication slippage model. Understanding the fine mechanisms associated with genomic rearrangements may indicate the nonrandomness of these events, highlighting hot spots regions. The complete concordance among MLPA, STRs analysis and 'deletion-specific PCR' supports the usefulness of MLPA in HHT molecular analysis.

23675457	"Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.

"	"A 67-year-old hypoxic woman was admitted following two episodes of cerebral infarction. Based on the clinical presentation and radiological findings, a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was made and the cerebral ischemic complications were considered to have been caused by paradoxical embolizations related to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and identified turbulent thrombi in one of the PAVMs that were capable of circulating systemically and inducing embolic strokes. The condition of the patient improved immediately following VATS. This case suggests that VATS may be a preferred therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with PAVM accompanying recurrent episodes of life-threatening complications such as strokes.

23702711	"Three-dimensional co-cultures of human endothelial cells and embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes inside a microfluidic device
"	"Organs-on-chips are microengineered in vitro tissue structures that can be used as platforms for physiological and pathological research. They provide tissue-like microenvironments in which different cell types can be co-cultured in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ mimics. Blood vessels are an integral part of all tissues in the human body. Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of organs-on-chips since generated tissues will require a blood or nutrient supply. Here, we have engineered three-dimensional constructs of vascular tissue inside microchannels by injecting a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells) and rat tail collagen I into a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel with dimensions 500 μm × 120 μm × 1 cm (w × h × l). Over the course of 12 h, the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the channel. Detailed examination of tube morphology by confocal microscopy revealed a mature endothelial monolayer with complete PECAM-1 staining at cell-cell contacts and pericytes incorporated inside the tubular structures. We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for normal vascular development; deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and mutations in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic diseases. In the engineered microvessels, inhibition of TGF-β signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher tortuosity, highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). In summary, we have developed microengineered three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell types. In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue constructs to advance the development of organs-on-chips.

Direct sequencing was performed to detect the mutation. Mutation analysis was carried out to evaluate its significance. A heterozygous c. 263A > G mutation was identified in exon 3 of ACVRL-1 in 6 out of 11 members in NMG-1 pedigree. In GD-2 pedigree, 5 of 11 members carried c. 199C > G mutation. Mutation detection rate was 100% in subjects with nosebleed history and 25% in family members without epistaxis.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.

"	"Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

"	"To assess the safety and efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency (RF) treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with mild or moderate epistaxis. We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT), also known as the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a multiorganic vascular disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Diagnostic clinical criteria include: epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance. HHT is transmitted in 90% of the cases as an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in either endoglin (ENG), or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) genes (HHT type 1 and 2, respectively). We have carried out a genetic analysis of four independent Spanish families with HHT clinical criteria, which has permitted the identification of new large deletions in ENG. These mutations were first detected using the MLPA technique and subsequently, the deletion breakpoints were mapped using a customized copy number variation (CNV) microarray. The array was designed to cover the ENG gene and surrounding areas. All tested families carried large deletions ranging from 3-kb to 100-kb, involving the ENG gene promoter, several ENG exons, and the two downstream genes FGSH and CDK9. Interestingly, common breakpoints coincident with Alu repetitive sequences were found among these families. The systematic hybridization of DNA from HHT families, with deletions or duplications, to custom designed microarrays, could allow the mapping of breakpoints, coincident with repetitive Alu sequences that might act as ""hot spots"" in the development of chromosomal anomalies.

"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

24273414	"Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted. The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years. Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.

"	"To identify whether relationships exist between epistaxis and migraines in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), to potentially provide further preventative and therapeutic options for the debilitating nosebleeds that are often very difficult to manage in clinical practice. Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. 4.

Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

24520391	"Novel brain arteriovenous malformation mouse models for type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have a higher prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) than the general population and patients with other HHT subtypes. The pathogenesis of brain AVM in HHT1 patients is currently unknown and no specific medical therapy is available to treat patients. Proper animal models are crucial for identifying the underlying mechanisms for brain AVM development and for testing new therapies. However, creating HHT1 brain AVM models has been quite challenging because of difficulties related to deleting Eng-floxed sequence in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice. To create an HHT1 brain AVM mouse model, we used several Cre transgenic mouse lines to delete Eng in different cell-types in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice: R26CreER (all cell types after tamoxifen treatment), SM22α-Cre (smooth muscle and endothelial cell) and LysM-Cre (lysozyme M-positive macrophage). An adeno-associated viral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (AAV-VEGF) was injected into the brain to induce focal angiogenesis. We found that SM22α-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo caused AVMs in the postnatal brain, spinal cord, and intestines. Induction of Eng deletion in adult mice using R26CreER plus local VEGF stimulation induced the brain AVM phenotype. In both models, Eng-null endothelial cells were detected in the brain AVM lesions, and formed mosaicism with wildtype endothelial cells. However, LysM-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo did not cause AVM in the postnatal brain even after VEGF stimulation. In this study, we report two novel HHT1 brain AVM models that mimic many phenotypes of human brain AVM and can thus be used for studying brain AVM pathogenesis and testing new therapies. Further, our data indicate that macrophage Eng deletion is insufficient and that endothelial Eng homozygous deletion is required for HHT1 brain AVM development.

This study was designed to examine the function of CACs derived from patients with HHT. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients with HHT and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed for expression of CD34, CD133 and VEGF receptor 2 by flow cytometry. PBMNCs were cultured to procure early outgrowth CACs. Development of endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in CACs was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CAC apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V staining, and CAC migration assessed by a modified Boyden chamber assay. mRNA expression of endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVLR1 or ALK1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in CACs was measured by real time RT-PCR. The percentage of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs from HHT patients was significantly higher than in PBMNCs of healthy controls. CACs derived from patients with HHT not only showed a significant reduction in EC-selective surface markers following 7-day culture, but also a significant increase in the rate of basal apoptosis and blunted migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. CACs from HHT patients expressed significantly lower levels of ENG, ALK1 and eNOS mRNAs. In conclusion, CACs from patients with HHT exhibited various functional impairments, suggesting a reduced regenerative capacity of CACs to repair the vascular lesions seen in HHT patients.

Anti COX-2 therapy could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a hepatopulmonary syndrome or HHT with small PAVM. PAVMs are one of the main causes of morbidity in patients presenting with HHT disease, owing to the risks of rupture as well as paradoxical embolism exposing to stroke and/or cerebral abscess.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.

Speckle variance optical coherence tomography exploits the large variance values of intensity changes in time caused mainly by the random backscattering of light resulting from translational activity of red blood cells to map out the microvascular networks. A method to map out the microvasculature malformation of skin based on the time-domain histograms of individual pixels is presented with results obtained from both normal skin and skin containing vascular malformation. Results demonstrated that this method can potentially map out deeper blood vessels and enhance the visualization of microvasculature in low signal regions, while being resistant against motion (e.g., patient tremor or internal reflex movements). The overall results are manifested as more uniform en face projection maps of microvessels. Potential applications include clinical imaging of skin vascular abnormalities and wide-field skin angiography for the study of complex vascular networks.

"	"Targeted ultrasound contrast imaging has the potential to become a reliable molecular imaging tool. A better understanding of the quantitative aspects of molecular ultrasound technology could facilitate the translation of this technique to the clinic for the purposes of assessing vascular pathology and detecting individual response to treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether targeted ultrasound contrast-enhanced imaging can provide a quantitative measure of endogenous biomarkers. Endoglin, an endothelial biomarker involved in the processes of development, vascular homeostasis, and altered in diseases, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 and tumor angiogenesis, was the selected target. We used a parallel plate perfusion chamber in which endoglin-targeted (MBE), rat isotype IgG2 control and untargeted microbubbles were perfused across endoglin wild-type (Eng+/+), heterozygous (Eng+/-) and null (Eng-/-) embryonic mouse endothelial cells and their adhesion quantified. Microbubble binding was also assessed in late-gestation, isolated living transgenic Eng+/- and Eng+/+ embryos. Nonlinear contrast-specific ultrasound imaging performed at 21 MHz was used to collect contrast mean power ratios for all bubble types. Statistically significant differences in microbubble binding were found across genotypes for both in vitro (p<0.05) and embryonic studies (p<0.001); MBE binding was approximately twofold higher in Eng+/+ cells and embryos compared with their Eng+/- counterparts. These results suggest that molecular ultrasound is capable of reliably differentiating between molecular genotypes and relating receptor densities to quantifiable molecular ultrasound levels.

The genes known to be associated with HHT include ENG (HHT1), ACVRL1 (HHT2) and SMAD4 (JPHT). It has been reported that circulating CD34(+) cell subsets repair damaged vessels. To investigate whether mobilization of these cells is present in the peripheral blood (PB) of HTT patients, we analyzed CD34(+) cells, CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+) progenitor or mature endothelial cells, and CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed in 150 HTT patients and 43 healthy subjects (CTRLs). In HTT patients, PB CD34(+) cells were significantly increased; the frequency of endothelial cells was higher (P = 0.002), while the frequency of CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) HPCs was lower (P = 0.00007) than in CTRLs. Results were comparable in patients with ENG or ACVRL1 gene mutation; in patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of the cell subsets inversely correlated with the age of the patients at time of sampling (CD34(+)), disease duration (CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+)), and age at disease onset (CD34(+)CD133(+) VEGFR-2(-)). In conclusion, HHT patients show an increase of circulating endothelial cells and a decrease of HPCs. In patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of CD34(+) endothelial cells correlates with specific clinical characteristics suggesting that their active turnover characterizes the initial phase of the disease.

Demographic, clinical, genotypic, and imaging information of 75 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with brain arteriovenous malformations enrolled in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium from 2010 to 2012 were reviewed. Nonshunting, small, superficially located conglomerates of enhancing vessels without enlarged feeding arteries or draining veins called ""capillary vascular malformations"" were the most commonly observed lesion (46 of 75 patients; 61%), followed by shunting ""nidus-type"" brain AVMs that were typically located superficially with a low Spetzler-Martin Grade and a small size (32 of 75 patients; 43%).

Multiplicity of vascular malformations was seen in 33 cases (44%). No statistically significant correlation was observed between hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia gene mutation and lesion type or lesion multiplicity.

25763011	"Contribution of oxidative stress to endothelial dysfunction in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.

"	"HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.

Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062).

25909848	"BMP9 Crosstalk with the Hippo Pathway Regulates Endothelial Cell Matricellular and Chemokine Responses
"	"Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease defined by the presence of epistaxis and mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in internal organs. In most families (~85%), HHT is caused by mutations in the ENG (HHT1) or the ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes. Here, we report the results of genetic testing of 113 Norwegian families with suspected or definite HHT. Variants in ENG and ACVRL1 were found in 105 families (42 ENG, 63 ACVRL1), including six novel variants of uncertain pathogenic significance. Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway. We discuss the importance of founder mutations and present a thorough evaluation of missense and splice-site variants.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is an autosomic dominant disorder, which is characterized by the development of multiple arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may either rupture or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism causing stroke or cerebral abscess. Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.

Early diagnosis is important to avoid complications from vascular lesions, but diagnosis is difficult in asymptomatic patients. A 69-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of hepatic vascular malformations. He had mild anemia with iron deficiency, and dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant arteriovenous and arterioportal shunts throughout the liver. Telangiectasia from the pharynx to the duodenum was confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient history revealed episodes of epistaxis as well as a family history of epistaxis. He was diagnosed with HHT, although no other family member had been diagnosed with definite HHT. A diagnosis of HHT must be considered in patients with hepatic vascular malformations.

"	"The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients. Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.

"	"A subset of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develops pulmonary hypertension (PH) by mechanisms including pulmonary arterial hypertension, high flow, and elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

Although these vascular pulmonary pathologies are quite uncommon, they are the important part of the differential diagnosis of common pulmonary problems such as hypoxemia and pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis of PAVM in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations. The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

"	"Nasal closure has been shown to effectively manage severe epistaxis refractory to other treatments in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The nasal closure procedure may be underutilized because of its surgical complexity and flap breakdown. This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013. Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient. The technique is described. We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure. The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3. Comparison of 5 patients who underwent the traditional 3-flap nasal closure procedure and 8 patients receiving the 2-flap nasal closure showed no significant difference in postoperative ESS or GBI metrics. Mean operating room times of the traditional and simplified methods were 3.12 hours and 1.44 hours (p = 0.0001). Mean time to first revision for 8 nasal closure patients was 21.5 months. In short-term follow-up, the 2-flap procedure showed comparable effectiveness with significantly reduced complexity and operative time compared to the traditional nasal closure method.

26801773	"Novel homozygous BMP9 nonsense mutation causes pulmonary arterial hypertension: a case report
"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, fatal vascular disorder. Genetic predisposition plays vital roles in the development of PAH, with most mutations being identified in genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Defects in the BMP9 gene have been documented in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the most common inherited vascular disorder, which is occasionally associated with PAH. Selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR2 with BMP9 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension. We report the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic boy who was diagnosed with severe PAH and right heart failure at 3 years of age. During his stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, treatment was initiated with inhaled nitric oxide and intravenous epoprostenol; he subsequently was transitioned to treprostinil, sildenafil, and prophylactic enoxaparin. Now, two years later, the child is asymptomatic on sildenafil, bosentan, subcutaneous treprostinil, and warfarin. Genetic screening revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the BMP9 gene (c.76C > T; p.Gln26Ter). The child had no telangiectasias or arteriovenous malformations; family history also was negative. Subsequent parental testing showed both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation, indicating that the child inherited the BMP9 mutant allele from each parent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP9 mutation in a patient with PAH. The homozygous nonsense mutation may account for the early onset and severity of PAH in this patient and also fit the 'two-hit' model we proposed previously. The absence of clinical symptoms for PAH in the parents may be due to incomplete penetrance or various expressivities of the BMP9 mutations. Our study expands the spectrum of phenotypes related to BMP9 mutations.

"	"The aim of this study was to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) as a screening test for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This retrospective study included suspected patients with HHT who were screened for PAVM with a TCD and a chest computed tomography (CT) study. The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have been associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34-year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance. He underwent a pulmonary arteriography of the right upper and lower lobe with the use of a microcatheter system; however, the PAVM could not be visualized. Thus, he was managed medically. The patient was educated on the need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and surveillance imaging. Discussion. Our case highlights the importance of obtaining a complete past medical and family history in young patients with a history of recurrent epistaxis to elicit features of HHT. The diagnosis can be made clinically and directly affects family members, who would otherwise not receive appropriate screening.

After a positive saline contrast echocardiography, she underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, which revealed a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and multiple hepatic arteriovenous malformations. Therefore, she fulfilled criteria for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was managed with nasal packing, tranexamic acid, oral ferrous sulfate, and blood transfusions, as other treatment options were unavailable in this setting. This rare case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates that it occurs in an African population and that diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings can be surmounted. Treatment options remain limited in these settings.

27424345	"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: importance of a multidisciplinary approach
"	"The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations with an absence of capillaries between arteries and veins. One major manifestation site is the nasal mucous membrane where recurrent nosebleeds occur. Our clinical strategy to treat patients with HHT has the aim to reduce nasal bleeding long-term with minimal local and general side effects. We describe staged diagnosis and therapy including individual medical treatments of 97 patients with HHT. The success of treatment is monitored with a systematic questionnaire. The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy remains standard treatment of choice with no major side effects despite the need for repeated treatment. In addition new treatment strategies like nasal occlusion, local drug therapy, and nasal septal splinting show initial success. Improvement of the quality of life of HHT patients can be achieved by a multimodal concept. Several new treatment strategies like nasal septal splinting and nasal occlusion successfully expand the range of established methods. Further studies have to prove the safety and long-term effectiveness of the described individual medical treatments.

"	"Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.

"	"An intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula(dAVF)was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old man during a medical checkup. Except for a mild episode of pneumonia at the age of 22 years, his medical history was unremarkable. He had no family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia(HHT). The dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.

27646277	"Defective fluid shear stress mechanotransduction mediates hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

"	"To evaluate if injection of intravenous particles may provoke migraines in subjects with right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Migraine headaches commonly affect people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), especially those with pulmonary AVMs that provide right-to-left shunts. In our clinical practice, patients occasionally reported acute precipitation of migraine headaches following injection of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates for nuclear medicine scans. Self-reported migraine features and exacerbations were examined in HHT subjects with and without pulmonary AVMs, for a series of noninvasive and invasive investigations, using an unbiased online survey. One hundred and sixty-six subjects were classified as having both HHT and migraines. HHT subjects with migraines were more likely to have pulmonary AVMs (P < .0001). HHT subjects with pulmonary AVMs were more likely to report photophobia (P = .010), ""flashes of light"" (P = .011), or transient visual loss (P = .040). Pulse oximetry, x-rays, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans without intravenous contrast medium rarely, if ever, provoked migraines, but unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to exacerbate migraines by 14/124 (11.2%) subjects. One hundred and fourteen subjects had both enhanced and unenhanced CT examinations: studies with contrast media were more commonly reported to start (9/114 [7.8%]), and/or worsen migraines (18/114 [15.7%]), compared to those undertaken without contrast medium (P < .01), or after simple blood tests (P < .05). Additionally, migraine exacerbation was reported by 9/90 (10%) after contrast echocardiography, 2/44 (4.5%) after nuclear medicine scans, and 10/154 (6.5%) after blood tests. HHT subjects frequently report migraine exacerbation following blood tests, contrast echocardiograms, MRI imaging, and CT studies performed with intravenous contrast medium. Since air emboli are recognized to complicate intravenous injections, particularly those given by a pressurized pump during contrast enhanced CT, future studies should re-evaluate whether particulate emboli provoke migraines.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

HHT is characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and vascular visceral dysplasia responsible for visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). to report the experience of two university hospitals (Trousseau, Paris, and CHIC, Creteil) with screening children for HHT and pulmonary AVM (PAVM) using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). parents with confirmed HHT were offered to have their children screened for the mutation identified in their family, and informed consent was obtained. Children carrying the same mutation as their parents underwent HRCT of the chest without contrast. between 2008 and 2015, 99 children were screened for HHT mutations. Mutations were identified in 59 patients, that is 24 HHT1 and 35 HHT2. Radiologic and clinical screening was possible in 52 patients (21 HHT-1 and 31 HHT-2). Among those, PAVM was identified in 13 patients (25%; n = 8 HHT1; n = 5 HHT2), and four of them required embolization therapy. This study highlights the usefulness of genetic screening in children with known HHT family. It also suggests that a non-invasive protocol such as HRTC is an efficient approach to detect non-symptomatic lesions that are present early on in children carrying the ENG (HHT1), but also the ACVRL1 mutations (HHT2).

"	"PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.

"	"Use of reliable grading scores to measure epistaxis severity in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is essential in clinical routine and for scientific purposes. For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with multi-systemic vascular dysplasia. Early diagnosis through screening is important to prevent serious complications. How best to screen children of affected parents for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is often subject to debate. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram (TTCE) is considered optimal in screening for PAVMs in adults. Guidelines for the screening of children are not specific, reflecting the lack of scientific evidence on the best method to use. Aims of this study are (i) to evaluate our current screening method, consisting of history, physical examination, pulse oximetry, and chest radiography and (ii) to assess whether postponing more invasive screening for PAVMs until adulthood is safe. This is a prospective observational cohort study using a patient database. Over a period of 18 years (mean follow-up 9.21 years, SD 4.72 years), 436 children from HHT families were screened consecutively. A total of 175/436 (40%) children had a diagnosis of HHT. PAVMs were detected in 39/175 (22%) children, 33/39 requiring treatment by embolotherapy. None of the screened children suffered any PAVM-associated complications with this screening method. This study shows that a conservative screening method during childhood is sufficient to detect large PAVMs and protect children with HHT for PAVM-related complications. Postponing TTCE and subsequent chest CT scanning until adulthood to detect any smaller PAVMs does not appear to be associated with major risk.

A spectrum of vascular variants can involve the liver. Some of these variants may result in areas of enhancement that can mimic more serious pathologic conditions. In this article, the authors discuss a spectrum of variants and pathologic conditions that may involve the liver vasculature. These include variants, anomalies, and diseases involving the portal vein, such as rudimentary portal vein, thrombosis, cavernous transformation, thrombotic angiitis, thrombophlebitis, transient hepatic attenuation difference or transient hepatic intensity difference, portal venous aneurysm, and portal vein gas. The hepatic artery can be involved by various diseases, including thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Unusual ""third inflow"" sources of venous inflow are also discussed, including aberrant right gastric vein, aberrant left gastric vein, epigastric-paraumbilical veins, and cholecystic vein. A spectrum of variants and diseases involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, including thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, stenosis, torsion, congestive hepatopathy, and peliosis hepatis, are discussed. Vascular shunts are illustrated, including portosystemic shunts (intra- and extrahepatic), arterioportal shunt, shunts of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and acquired arteriovenous fistula.

Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of human ENG and its complex with the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). BMP9 interacts with a hydrophobic surface of the N-terminal orphan domain of ENG, which adopts a new duplicated fold generated by circular permutation. The interface involves residues mutated in HHT1 and overlaps with the epitope of tumor-suppressing anti-ENG monoclonal TRC105. The structure of the C-terminal zona pellucida module suggests how two copies of ENG embrace homodimeric BMP9, whose binding is compatible with ligand recognition by type I but not type II receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the BMP signaling cascade, with implications for future therapeutic interventions in this fundamental pathway.

Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%.

In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %). pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.

It is believed to be a safe and effective treatment for a selected group of HHT patients in reducing frequency and intensity of epistaxis, with few or none adverse effects. In this case report, however, we will describe a patient who developed bilateral osteonecrosis in the knees while undergoing regular intranasal submucosal bevacizumab injections.

"	"Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics RASA1-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. RASA1-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.

"	"The implications of basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity remain unclear in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This study was performed to assess the prevalence of this imaging finding in a large cohort of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to identify any association between this phenomenon and other disease manifestations. In this retrospective study, we identified all patients at our institution diagnosed with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia from 2001 to 2017. Patients who did not undergo brain MR imaging were excluded. Patient demographics, laboratory results, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease characteristics were noted. Basal ganglia hyperintensity was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively relative to the signal intensity in the ipsilateral thalami. Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available software. A total of 312 patients (41% men, 59% women; mean age, 51 ± 18 years) with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were identified. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity was present in 23.4% of patients and demonstrated a statistically significant association with older age (P < .001), increased hepatic AVMs (P < .001), high cardiac output state (P < .001), hepatic failure (P = .01), elevated peak serum alkaline phosphatase level (P = .03), and increased total bilirubin count (P = .03). There was no significant association with sex, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia genetic mutation status, parkinsonism, or serum transaminase levels. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity occurs in >23% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is associated with hepatic vascular malformations, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated cardiac output. The presence of this finding on screening MR imaging in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should prompt further evaluation for visceral lesions causing arteriovenous shunting.

"	"To discuss an uncommon case of a patient with multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) presenting with dyspnea on exertion and recurrent strokes. A 79-year-old woman with recent onset recurrent cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) was referred to cardiology for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. Clinical examination was unrevealing. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with agitated saline was suggestive of an extra-cardiac shunt. Subsequent chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated five large PAVMs. The patient underwent transcatheter coil embolization of the five PAVMs, resulting in marked improvement in dyspnea and resolution of the shunt on bubble study echocardiography. Although PAVMs are rare, they remain an important entity to consider when evaluating patients with extracardiac shunts. They may present with nonspecific features such as dyspnea on exertion and recurrent CVAs. All patients with multiple PAVMs should undergo thorough skin screening for telangiectasia as well as radiologic imaging to screen for additional AVMs in the liver and brain in order to exclude hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

28973643	"Tacrolimus rescues the signaling and gene expression signature of endothelial ALK1 loss-of-function and improves HHT vascular pathology
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a highly debilitating and life-threatening genetic vascular disorder arising from endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and hypervascularization, for which no cure exists. Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs. Tacrolimus repurposing has therefore therapeutic potential in HHT.

"	"Our objective was to describe epistaxis onset and severity in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients and study the cumulative incidence of epistaxis by age of onset within each genetic subtype. Retrospective cohort chart review. Charts were reviewed of patients age 0 to 18 years with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of HHT who were evaluated at a tertiary multidisciplinary HHT clinic from January 2010 to June 2016. The epistaxis severity score (ESS), a validated tool for assessing epistaxis severity, was used to assess epistaxis. Statistical analyses were conducted on the full HHT cohort as well as subgroups stratified by the HHT causative gene (HHT1 = ENG and HHT2 = ACVRL1). Sixty-nine pediatric subjects were identified; 60 had HHT confirmed by genetic testing, and nine (from families with known mutations) met published clinical diagnostic criteria alone. Fifty-nine (85%) had onset of epistaxis. The median age of onset of epistaxis was 5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-9 years). The median ESS for the entire cohort was 1.6 (IQR: 0-2.6). The median ESS was higher in HHT1 versus HHT2 (2.3 vs. 1.1, P = .002), and age of epistaxis onset was earlier in HHT1 (3 vs. 5 years, P = .03). Sex and age were not associated with ESS. Epistaxis may present early in HHT, but is typically mild in the pediatric period. Severity in the pediatric population is worse in patients with HHT1. By recognizing the significance of even mild, infrequent epistaxis in a child with a family history of HHT, and understanding that not all HHT patients have epistaxis during childhood, community providers and otolaryngologist can assist in the early detection of HHT. 4 Laryngoscope, 128:1714-1719, 2018.

Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

"	"To present a multiyear clinical experience with intravenous bevacizumab for the management of severe gastrointestinal bleeding and/or epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). All patients treated with intravenous bevacizumab for severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related bleeding from June 1, 2013, through January 31, 2017, were included in this report. Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients. Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores (P<.001) and RBC transfusion requirements (P=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function. Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship as well as clinical, genetic, and biomarker predictors of response.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels due to mutations in specific genes that lead to angiogenesis errors. HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.

Nine newly diagnosed HHT-PAH patients were prospectively recruited between October 2007 and January 2016 and were followed up every half-year. Eighteen idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients, matched with HHT-PAH patients on mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), were recruited. The clinical characteristics of HHT-PAH patients were described and the prognosis of these two cohorts were compared. Of HHT-PAH patients, 55.56% were WHO FC III. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed one- and three-year survival rates of HHT-PAH patients were 77.8% and 53.3% respectively, which were worse than matched IPAH patients (log rank: P = 0.047). HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid.

"	"Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is an important risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. Current treatments for bAVM are all associated with considerable risks. There is no safe method to prevent bAVM hemorrhage. Thalidomide reduces nose bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an inherited disorder characterized by vascular malformations. In this study, we tested whether thalidomide and its less toxic analog, lenalidomide, reduce bAVM hemorrhage using a mouse model. bAVMs were induced through induction of brain focal activin-like kinase 1 (Alk1, an AVM causative gene) gene deletion and angiogenesis in adult Alk1-floxed mice. Thalidomide was injected intraperitoneally twice per week for 6 weeks, starting either 2 or 8 weeks after AVM induction. Lenalidomide was injected intraperitoneally daily starting 8 weeks after AVM induction for 6 weeks. Brain samples were collected at the end of the treatments for morphology, mRNA, and protein analyses. The influence of Alk1 downregulation on PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor B) expression was also studied on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells. The effect of PDGFB in mural cell recruitment in bAVM was explored by injection of a PDGFB overexpressing lentiviral vector to the mouse brain. Thalidomide or lenalidomide treatment reduced the number of dysplastic vessels and hemorrhage and increased mural cell (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) coverage in the bAVM lesion. Thalidomide reduced the burden of CD68+ cells and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the bAVM lesions. PDGFB expression was reduced in ALK1-knockdown human brain microvascular endothelial cells and in mouse bAVM lesion. Thalidomide increased Pdgfb expression in bAVM lesion. Overexpression of PDGFB mimicked the effect of thalidomide. Thalidomide and lenalidomide improve mural cell coverage of bAVM vessels and reduce bAVM hemorrhage, which is likely through upregulation of Pdgfb expression.

Genetic testing for a pathogenic mutation was considered the gold standard against which the clinical Curaçao criteria were compared. Patients were divided into 4 age categories: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-21-years. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each age group, and for the overall population. Overall the Curaçao criteria had a sensitivity of 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 91%-100%). Sensitivity was lowest in the 0- to 5-year group, and increased with advancing age.

In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.

30095617	"A case report of hepatopulmonary syndrome in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Not all right-to-left shunting in HHT is due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vessel growth that results in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia. We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea. Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.

"	"A 76-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzyme levels, and abdominal imaging studies revealed a hepatic tumor. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 759.5 ng/mL. A pathological examination after hepatectomy confirmed a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An examination of the surrounding liver revealed dilated vessels and thickened endothelial cells without inflammations. HHT patients without other risk factors (like this patient) reportedly have a lower incidence of common cancers, including HCC, in comparison to the unaffected population. One intriguing hypothesis that might explain the hepatocarcinogenesis in this situation is the ischemic liver cirrhosis theory, which suggests that chronic ischemia may cause parenchymal strain and promote inappropriate hepatocyte proliferation.

Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be found in patients suffering from a loss-of-function mutation of the gene encoding for the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1 receptor. Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as epistaxis. Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH. Recently, it was shown that tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.

30272025	"Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required for RAD51-mediated maintenance of genome integrity in vascular endothelial cells
"	"The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with HHT can develop vascular dysplasias called telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.

"	"Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. We provide a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT, with a focus on the risk of recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010, with a survival of more than 1 year. Protocol clinical, radiological, and histological examinations were performed at regular intervals. Fourteen patients were included (13 women and one man). Median age at LT was 52.5 years (range: 33.1-66.7). In eight patients (seven female), disease recurrence was diagnosed by abnormal radiological features, suggestive of microcirculatory disturbances. Typical vascular lesions, including telangiectasia, were demonstrated by liver biopsy in five of these patients. The median interval between LT and diagnosis of recurrence was 127 months (range: 74-184). The risk of recurrence increased over time; estimated cumulative risk was 47.9% at 15 years. Liver tissue analysis found the coexistence of an angiogenic process combined with endothelial microchimerism, as shown by the presence of vascular lining cells of recipient origin. Conclusion: The present data show that disease recurrence occurs, usually after a long delay, in a significant number of patients treated by LT for liver complications of HHT. This strongly supports the necessity of a lifelong follow-up and suggests that therapeutic strategy needs discussion and evaluation, especially of the role of potential adjuvant treatments to LT, such as antiangiogenic medications, when recurrent disease appears.

"	"Introduction: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) mainly affecting the lungs and the liver. In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

Capsule endoscopy (CE) is emerging as a safe and non-invasive alternative for small intestinal evaluation, but its diagnostic yield and utility in diagnosing small bowel AVMs in HHT patients are understudied. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the utility of CE for diagnosing AVMs in HHT patients. Methods  A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature on CE in HHT patients identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2018 were conducted. Summary effects were estimated using a random effects model. Results  After applying exclusion criteria, five studies (n = 124 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic yield for visualization of small bowel AVMs by CE was 77.0 % (95 % CI 65.8 - 85.4 %, P  < 0.001). Conclusions  CE has a good diagnostic yield for small bowel AVMs in HHT. It can be regarded as a sufficient, noninvasive diagnostic modality for identifying small bowel AVMs in HHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular dysplasia that leads to nosebleeds and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Anti-angiogenic drugs thalidomide and bevacizumab have been increasingly used off-label with variable results. The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs) classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001). Thalidomide AEs occurred at more similar rates in males (25 AEs in 41 men, 60.9%) and females (12 in 26 (46.2%), but were more common in ENG patients (17 in 17) than in ACVRL1 (14 in 34, p < 0.0001). For bevacizumab, the most common reports were of joint pains (7/69, 10%), headache (3/69, 4.4%) and proteinuria (2/69, 3%), and for thalidomide, peripheral neuropathy (12/67, 18%); drowsiness (8/67, 12%); and dizziness (6/67, 9%). Fatal adverse events were more common in males (p = 0.009), and in patients with ENG pathogenic variants (p = 0.012). One fatal AE was possibly related to bevacizumab (average incidence rate: 1.5 per 100 person-years); 3 fatal AEs were possibly related to thalidomide (average incidence rate: 4 per 100 person-years). With potential increase in use of Bevacizumab and Thalidomide in HHT patients, data presented support appropriate weighing of the toxicities which can arise in HHT settings and the practice recommendations for their prevention and management.

30744395	"Angiopoietin-2 Inhibition Rescues Arteriovenous Malformation in a Smad4 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Mouse Model
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in 4 transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway members, including the central transcriptional mediator of the TGFβ pathway, Smad4. Loss of Smad4 causes the formation of inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can hemorrhage leading to stroke, aneurysm, or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and the TGFβ downstream effectors responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated AVM formation are currently unknown. To identify potential biological targets of the TGFβ pathway involved in AVM formation, we performed RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments on BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9)-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and isolated ECs from a Smad4-inducible, EC-specific knockout ( Smad4-iECKO) mouse model that develops retinal AVMs. These sequencing studies identified the angiopoietin-Tek signaling pathway as a downstream target of SMAD4. We used monoclonal blocking antibodies to target a specific component in this pathway and assess its effects on AVM development. Sequencing studies uncovered 212 potential biological targets involved in AVM formation, including the EC surface receptor, TEK (TEK receptor tyrosine kinase) and its antagonistic ligand, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2). In Smad4-iECKO mice, Angpt2 expression is robustly increased, whereas Tek levels are decreased, resulting in an overall reduction in angiopoietin-Tek signaling. We provide evidence that SMAD4 directly represses Angpt2 transcription in ECs. Inhibition of ANGPT2 function in Smad4-deficient mice, either before or after AVMs form, prevents and alleviates AVM formation and normalizes vessel diameters. These rescue effects are attributed to a reversion in EC morphological changes, such as cell size and shape that are altered in the absence of Smad4. Our studies provide a novel mechanism whereby the loss of Smad4 causes increased Angpt2 transcription in ECs leading to AVM formation, increased blood vessel calibers, and changes in EC morphology in the retina. Blockade of ANGPT2 function in an in vivo Smad4 model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia alleviated these vascular phenotypes, further implicating ANGPT2 as an important TGFβ downstream mediator of AVM formation. Therefore, alternative approaches that target ANGPT2 function may have therapeutic value for the alleviation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms, such as AVMs.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

"	"To provide an update of vascular malformation syndromes by reviewing the most recent articles on the topic and following the new International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) 2018 classification. This review discusses the main features and diagnostic approaches of the vascular malformation syndromes, the new genetic findings and the new therapeutic strategies developed in recent months. Some vascular malformations can be associated with other anomalies, such as tissue overgrowth. PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) is a group of rare genetic disorders with asymmetric overgrowth caused by somatic mosaic mutations in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that encompass a heterogeneous group of rare disorder that are associated with the appearance of overgrowth. CLOVES syndrome and Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome are PROS disease. Proteus syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome caused by a somatic activating mutation in AKT1. CLOVES, Klippel-Trénaunay and Proteus syndromes are associated with high risk of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomic dominant disorder characterized by the presence of arteriovenous malformations. New therapeutic strategies with bevacizumab and thalidomide have been employed with promising results.

31441079	"Laser-Assisted Control of Epistaxis in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: A Systematic Review.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31455059	"Current Status of Clinical Diagnosis and Genetic Analysis of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia in South Korea: Multicenter Case Series and a Systematic Review
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea. We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: (""hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia"" AND ""Korea"") OR (""Osler-Weber-Rendu"" AND ""Korea""). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea. We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations. The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.

"	"The objective of this study was to report for the first time on the results of submucosal injections of bevacizumab used in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Retrospective analytic chart review. We performed a chart review that included all patients with HHT treated with intranasal bevacizumab and cyanoacrylate glue for refractory epistaxis at Lariboisiere University Hospital from 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. We injected 100 mg (25 mg/mL) of bevacizumab diluted in 2 mL of serum at the base of the telangiectasias, and sclerotherapy with an injection of cyanoacrylate glue was used adjunctively. Treatment efficacy was based on changes in Epistaxis Severity Scores (ESS) and the Bergler-Sadick Scale. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder (CL) and Likert scale, respectively. Thirty-one patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 26.6 months. The average ESS score significantly decreased from 7.82 to 3.89 (P < .05). The Bergler-Sadick score significantly improved (P < .05) following the treatment, including the frequency (from 2.74 to 1.64) and the quantity (from 2.54 to 1.51) scales. Quality of life was significantly improved (P < .05) using the CL score (from 4.16 to 7.22). The Likert satisfaction scale related to the treatment efficacy was high, with an average of 7.03 out of 10. No complications were noted. Submucosal injections of bevacizumab in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy significantly reduced epistaxis and improved the quality of life in HHT. Prospective comparative studies are needed to further evaluate the significance of this treatment modality. 3b Laryngoscope, 129:2210-2215, 2019.

31615556	"Prospective pilot study of Floseal® for the treatment of anterior epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
"	"Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting more than 98% of adults with HHT, with significant impact on quality of life. Floseal® has been shown to be effective for the management of anterior epistaxis, but has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in this population. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Floseal® for managing acute anterior epistaxis in patients with HHT. A pilot prospective clinical trial was conducted at two tertiary referral centres, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada and The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. All patients with HHT presenting with acute anterior epistaxis to the two study centres, who enrolled in the study, received Floseal® treatment. The primary outcome measures were achievement of hemostasis and changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) between baseline and one-month follow up. Secondary outcome measure included clinical assessment of the nasal cavity. Seven patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent treatment of anterior epistaxis with Floseal® and achieved control of epistaxis within 15-min post-application. Application of Floseal® was well tolerated, with patients reporting a pain score of 3 ± 3.13 out of 10. There was no statistically significant difference noted in ESS scores pre-treatment and one-month follow up, 6.27 ± 2.42 vs. 4.50 ± 2.44, p = 0.179. There was a significant improvement clinically on exam of the nasal cavity between baseline and at one-month follow up, indicated by a decrease in the clinical assessment score, 17.29 ± 7.70 vs. 9.57 ± 7.81 (p = 0.0088). Patients with HHT presenting with acute epistaxis were able to achieve hemostasis with one application of Floseal®, with the procedure being very well tolerated with minimal pain. Although there was no significant change in ESS scores, clinical assessment of the nasal cavity revealed significant improvement at one-month follow up post treatment with Floseal®. This multi-centered prospective clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02638012 ). Registered on December 22, 2015.

31689244	"Correcting Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 treats pathology in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia models
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.

31828546	"BMP10-mediated ALK1 signaling is continuously required for vascular development and maintenance.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.

Endoscopic tests were performed when there was suspicion of GI bleeding, and patients were divided as follows: with, without, and with unsuspected GI involvement. 67 (27.9%) patients with, 28 (11.7%) patients without, and 145 (60.4%) with unsuspected GI involvement were included. Age, tobacco use, endoglin (ENG) mutation, and hemoglobin were associated with GI involvement. Telangiectases were mostly in the stomach and duodenum, but 18.5% of patients with normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) had GI involvement in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Telangiectases ≤ 3 mm and ≤10 per location were most common. Among patients with GI disease, those with hemoglobin < 8 g/dL or transfusion requirements (65.7%) were older and had higher epistaxis severity score (ESS) and larger telangiectases (>3 mm). After a mean follow-up of 34.2 months, patients with GI involvement required more transfusions and more emergency department and hospital admissions, with no differences in mortality. Risk factors for GI involvement have been identified. Patients with GI involvement and severe anemia had larger telangiectases and higher ESS. VCE should be considered in patients with suspicion of GI bleeding, even if EGD is normal.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral vascular malformations. Individuals suffering from HHT have a significantly increased risk of bacterial infections, but the mechanisms involved in this are not clear. White blood cell subpopulations were estimated with flow cytometry in 79 patients with HHT and 45 healthy individuals, and association with clinicopathological status was assessed. A prominent decrease in absolute numbers of T cells in HHT was revealed (0.7 (0.5-1.1) vs. 1.3 (0.8-1.6), 106/mL, p < 0.05), and in multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin level was associated with lymphopenia (OR = 0.625, 95% CI: 0.417-0.937, p < 0.05). Although no changes in absolute numbers of neutrophils and monocytes were observed, we revealed a significant impairment of neutrophil antibacterial functions in HHT (n = 9), compared to healthy individuals (n = 7), in vitro. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MOI10 was significantly suppressed in HHT (mean area per cell, mm2: 76 (70-92) vs. 121 (97-128), p < 0.05), due to impaired filamentous actin organization (% of positive cells: 69 (59-77) vs. 92 (88-94), p < 0.05). To conclude, this study reveals the categories of patients with HHT that are prone to immunosuppression and require careful monitoring, and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy based on the functional activation of neutrophils.

Genomic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation of c.100T>A, p.Cys34Ser in the patient's ACVRL1 gene. We used 6 freeware programs to perform an in silico analysis of this mutation. The results demonstrated the mutation's high pathogenicity.

32493237	"Liver cirrhosis in a patient with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome: a case report.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often involves the liver, and belongs to abnormal blood vessel disease. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is not clear, but congenital vascular dysplasia is considered to be one of the causes. Liver cirrhosis due to hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia concomitant with BCS has not been reported. Here, we report a case of cirrhosis with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHHT) and BCS. A 58-year-old woman with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia showed decompensated liver cirrhosis, and abdominal imaging revealed Budd-Chiari syndrome. Disease has progressed considerably during 2.5 years after hospital discharge despite subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). One hypothesis that might explain the coexistence of hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome in this patient is ischemia and thrombosis of hepatic veins. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between HHHT and BCS. Our observations already challenged the TIPS therapeutic strategy in BCS secondary to HHHT patients.

"	"A 14-year-old girl was diagnosed with hemothorax associated with pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture, and emergency surgery was performed. One week before her surgery, her mother at 32 weeks of gestation underwent emergency surgery for hemothorax caused by pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture. Both were diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The indications for treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in young patients remain controversial because the risk of complications concerning pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is lower in young patients than in adult patients. We recommend that aggressive treatment should be performed for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis with a family history of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture even if the patient is asymptomatic and young, because such patients may have a high risk of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture.

32573726	"Mutational and phenotypic characterization of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Care delivery for HHT patients is impeded by the need for laborious, repeated phenotyping and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between causal DNA variants in ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4 and GDF2, and clinical manifestations. To address this, we analyzed DNA samples from 183 previously uncharacterized, unrelated HHT and suspected HHT cases using the ThromboGenomics high-throughput sequencing platform. We identified 127 rare variants across 168 heterozygous genotypes. Applying modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines, 106 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 21 as nonpathogenic (variant of uncertain significance/benign). Unlike the protein products of ACVRL1 and SMAD4, the extracellular ENG amino acids are not strongly conserved. Our inferences of the functional consequences of causal variants in ENG were therefore informed by the crystal structure of endoglin. We then compared the accuracy of predictions of the causal gene blinded to the genetic data using 2 approaches: subjective clinical predictions and statistical predictions based on 8 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Both approaches had some predictive power, but they were insufficiently accurate to be used clinically, without genetic testing. The distributions of red cell indices differed by causal gene but not sufficiently for clinical use in isolation from genetic data. We conclude that parallel sequencing of the 4 known HHT genes, multidisciplinary team review of variant calls in the context of detailed clinical information, and statistical and structural modeling improve the prognostication and treatment of HHT.

"	"We determined the frequency of cerebrovascular malformations in a pediatric cohort with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Retrospective cohort study of 54 children diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at a tertiary care center. All neuroimaging was reviewed to assess for number and types of cerebrovascular malformations and for intracerebral hemorrhage and arterial ischemic stroke. Clinical charts were reviewed for clinical manifestations, genetic mutation, and clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhages and arterial ischemic strokes. Among 54 children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a median age of 3.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 7.9 years) at diagnosis, neuroimaging was performed in 52 (96.3%) at a median age of 5.2 years (interquartile range 1.8 to 9 years). Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The three children with intracerebral hemorrhage presented at young ages (4.3 to 7.7 years). More than a quarter of children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who were imaged had cerebrovascular malformations, and overt stroke occurred in more than 10%. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients at young ages, and new cerebral arteriovenous malformations may develop over time. Early screening with neuroimaging including neurovascular imaging as well as repeat neuroimaging may be warranted in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

"	"To test if the impairment of mononuclear cell (MNC) migration in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is due to the reduction of the endoglin (ENG) receptor on the cell surface and oxidative stress. MNCs of HHT patients and normal controls were subjected to migration assay. Fractions of MNCs were pre-incubated with antibodies specific to HHT causative genes ENG [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1)] or activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2)], AMD3100 or Diprotin-A to block ENG, ALK1 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) or CD26 (increased in HHT1 MNCs) before migration assay. The MNCs were allowed to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 18 h. The expression of CXCR4, CD26, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) in MNCs and nitric oxide levels in the plasma were analyzed. Compared to the controls, fewer HHT1 MNCs and similar number of HHT2 MNCs migrated toward SDF-1α. Diprotin-A pre-treatment improved HHT1 MNC-migration, but had no effect on normal and HHT2 MNCs. Pre-incubation with an anti-ENG antibody reduced the migration of normal MNCs. Diprotin-A did not improve the migration of ENG antibody pre-treated MNCs. Anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on MNC-migration. AMD3100 treatment reduced normal and HHT MNC-migration. ENG mRNA level was reduced in HHT1 and HHT2 MNCs. ALK1 mRNA was reduced in HHT2 MNCs only. CD26 expression was higher in HHT1 MNCs. Pre-treatment of MNCs with anti-ENG or anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on CD26 and CXCR4 expression. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, SOD1, was reduced in HHT1 MNCs, which was accompanied with an increase of ROS in HHT MNCs and nitric oxide in HHT1 plasma. Reduction of ENG receptor on MNC surface reduced monocyte migration toward SDF-1α independent of CD26 expression. Increased oxidative stress could alter HHT MNC migration behavior.

Dietary evaluation is relevant in HHT patients to provide adequate iron and nutrient intake. Additionally, different dietary items have been reported to precipitate epistaxis in this setting. Our primary aim was to investigate the dietary habits of HHT patients through a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate the presence of precipitants and/or protective factors for epistaxis and the occurrence of possible dietary modifications. The secondary aims were to evaluate the nutritional intake of iron in HHT patients and the self-reported effect of iron treatments on epistaxis. From April 2018 to October 2018, a 138-item FFQ was provided to HHT patients followed up at the HHT Referral Center of Crema Maggiore Hospital. The relationship between food items and epistaxis was ascertained on a separate form. Daily iron intake was calculated to establish the mean iron content of food items reported in the FFQ. One hundred forty-nine questionnaires were evaluated [72 females, median age 54 years (12-76). Overall, 26 (18%) patients reported dietary items that improved epistaxis (mostly blueberries and red fruits, green vegetables and legumes), while 38 (26%) reported some dietary items that exacerbated epistaxis (spices, chocolate, alcohol, strawberries and ginger). Dietary modifications were reported in up to 58% of cases. In HHT patients, the mean daily iron intake was 8.46 ± 2.78 mg, and no differences were observed in the iron intake of patients reporting a diet modification and those who did not. In the comprehensive management of HHT a healthy and balanced diet, with increased consumption of dietary items with a high iron content, should be encouraged.

We have investigated whether HHT patients, systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed, have a similar survival as persons without HHT. We included all individuals screened for HHT between 2004 and 2016 with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis (HHT group) or excluded diagnosis (non-HHT control group). The social security number was used to confirm status as dead or alive in December 2019. We included 717 HHT patients and 471 controls. There was no difference in survival between the HHT and the non-HHT control group. The HHT group had a life expectancy of 75.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.3-78.6), comparable to the control group (79.3 years, 95% CI 74.8-84.0, Mantel-Cox test: p = 0.29).

33242965	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation managed by VATS lobectomy
"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is formed by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins that bypass the pulmonary capillaries and transport deoxygenated blood through pulmonary veins to the left heart. This causes insufficient oxygenation of blood in the lungs. This condition remains symptomless for a long period of time. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, nosebleeds, increased fatigue and a gradual development of cyanosis. Paradoxical embolism in the brain is a serious complication; it can present with a stroke or a brain abscess. Treatment of the disease consists of embolization of the pathological vascular connections, surgical resection of the affected pulmonary parenchyma and management of concomitant manifestations of the disease. PAVM in most common cases arises as a result of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder referred to as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Case report: In our communication, we document the diagnostic and therapeutic management in a young patient diagnosed with PAVM after falling off his bicycle. Based on comprehensive assessments, AV malformations with a 40% shunt of the pulmonary circulation were detected. An angiographic procedure was not an appropriate option considering the type and extent of the condition. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic resection of the affected pulmonary lobe was indicated. Conclusion: PAVM is a rare finding. PAVM should be ruled out in all patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) signs in the oral cavity. Contrast sonography of the heart and contract CT of the chest are the methods of choice for the diagnosis. Conservative or pharmacological treat-ment fails to improve the patients status.  The condition is usually managed by embolization. Cases where PAVM is rather extensive or diffuse, where endovascular management would be inappropriate, can be well managed using endoscopic resection adequate to the extent of the condition.

"	"This report addresses how patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and high output cardiac failure (HOCF) due to hepatic vascular malformations, should be evaluated and could be treated. HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.

"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

"	"Epistaxis can be an isolated finding or a manifestation of a systemic disease. Some of the potential etiologies are usage of anticoagulants, bleeding disorders, vascular aneurysms, nasal neoplasm, hypertension and nasal steroids. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) as a cause of recurrent epistaxis is uncommon. In this report, we describe an 18-year-old adolescent with recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and family history of HHT, consistent with HHT. Timely diagnosis is needed not only to treat the epistaxis but also to be vigilant for other serious manifestations of this condition.

Embolization had not been performed because of numerous bilateral small pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Although he appeared to be qualified for lung transplantation, we instead performed bilateral thoracoscopic multiple wide wedge resections because of his age, lifestyle as a farmer, and relatively clustered distribution of arteriovenous malformations. Intermittent bilateral ventilation was needed because of poor oxygenation in the early stages of surgery, but his oxygenation improved as the resection progressed. His postoperative oxygenation improved significantly, and lung transplantation was avoided.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder that presents with recurrent, intractable epistaxis. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of various treatment options for epistaxis in patients with HHT, over a period of 18 years, and to correlate these findings with available evidence in the literature. Records of patients with HHT, treated for epistaxis between 2000 and 2018 were analyzed. Treatment procedures carried out and their efficacy were extracted and analyzed. Forty-three records were evaluated. All patients were given nasal humidifying ointments, 93% required acute treatment with bipolar electrocautery, and 60% underwent atraumatic nasal packing. Recurrent cases were treated medically with tranexamic acid (26%), oestrogen (19%), and bevacizumab (2%). Laser photocoagulation was done in selected cases (40%) and if unsuccessful, septal dermoplasty was performed (2.3%). Endovascular embolization was reserved for life-threatening emergencies (7%). Epistaxis in HHT is not curable, but can be managed by employing a comprehensive stepwise approach. An algorithm for effective and comprehensive management has been presented.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement.

20042635	"ALK5 phosphorylation of the endoglin cytoplasmic domain regulates Smad1/5/8 signaling and endothelial cell migration
"	"Endoglin, an endothelial cell-specific transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor, has an essential role in angiogenesis. Endoglin-null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype due to defects in angiogenesis and mutations in endoglin result in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I. Increased endoglin expression in the proliferating endothelium of tumors has been correlated with metastasis, tumor grade and decreased survival. Although endoglin is thought to regulate TGF-beta superfamily signaling in endothelial cells through regulating the balance between two TGF-beta-responsive pathways, the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad2/3 pathway and the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1/5/8 pathway, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis has not been defined. Here, we investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and its phosphorylation by ALK5 in regulating endoglin function in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin is basally phosphorylated by ALK5, primarily on serines 646 and 649, in endothelial cells. Functionally, the loss of phosphorylation at serine 646 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to TGF-beta and endothelial cell migration, whereas loss of phosphorylation at both serines 646 and 649 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to bone morphogenetic protein-9. Taken together, these results support endoglin phosphorylation by ALK5 as an important mechanism for regulating TGF-beta superfamily signaling and migration in endothelial cells.

20042709	"Spontaneous adult-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to increased endothelial oxidative stress in a murine model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

"	"Activin A receptor type II-like kinase-1 (ACVRL1, also known as ALK1) mutation is a cause of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and/or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). To describe the characteristics of patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation. We reviewed clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics of 32 patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation, corresponding to 9 patients from the French PAH Network and 23 from literature analysis. These cases were compared with 370 patients from the French PAH Network (93 with a bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 [BMPR2] mutation and 277 considered as idiopathic cases without identified mutation). Distribution of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene in patients with PAH was compared with the HHT Mutation Database. At diagnosis, ACVRL1 mutation carriers were significantly younger (21.8 +/- 16.7 yr) than BMPR2 mutation carriers and noncarriers (35.7 +/- 14.9 and 47.6 +/- 16.3 yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). In seven of the nine patients from the French PAH Network, PAH diagnosis preceded manifestations of HHT. ACVRL1 mutation carriers had better hemodynamic status at diagnosis, but none responded to acute vasodilator challenge and they had shorter survival when compared with other patients with PAH despite similar use of specific therapies. ACVRL1 mutations in exon 10 were more frequently observed in patients with PAH, as compared with what was observed in the HHT Mutation Database (33.3 vs. 5%; P < 0.0001). ACVRL1 mutation carriers were characterized by a younger age at PAH diagnosis. Despite less severe initial hemodynamics and similar management, these patients had worse prognosis compared with other patients with PAH, suggesting more rapid disease progression.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by telangiectases and internal arteriovenous malformations caused by mutations in certain elements of the TGF-beta receptor complex. In the case of HHT1 mutations in the endoglin gene are responsible, whereas mutations in the ALK1 gene (an activin receptor-like kinase 1), lead to HHT2. Another two loci found at chromosome 5 and chromosome 7, whose target genes remain unidentified, lead to types 3 and 4 of the disease, respectively. Mutations in the MADH4/SMAD4 gene, another member of the TGF-beta signalling pathway, lead to a combined syndrome of familial juvenile polyposis associated with HHT. In an attempt to identify some soluble components differentially expressed in the plasma of HHT patients, angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin concentrations were analyzed with standard quantitative sandwich ELISA. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin levels are reduced in plasma of HHT patients compared to control individuals, and a diagnostic algorithm for HHT based on these protein levels is proposed. Down-regulated protein levels of angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin in plasma represent novel HHT biomarkers that could be useful in the biochemical diagnosis of HHT facilitating the rapid identification of potential HHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related epistaxis leads to alterations in social functioning and quality of life. Although more than 95% experience epistaxis, there is considerable variability of severity. Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score. Prospective, survey-based study. HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported epistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (OR 1.53, P < .001 for all). Risk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.

20101697	"Overlapping spectra of SMAD4 mutations in juvenile polyposis (JP) and JP-HHT syndrome
"	"Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, we collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.

"	"Transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) can detect pulmonary right-to-left shunting (RLS) and is used to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). We studied the prevalence and size of pulmonary RLS in HHT type 1, HHT type 2, and HHT-negative controls, and its positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for PAVMs that can be treated by embolotherapy. In 343 consecutive persons referred for possible HHT as first-degree family members of index patients a TTCE and chest CT scan were performed. All persons were offered genetic analysis. An HHT-causing mutation was confirmed in 92 (mean age 41 ± 15 y; 59% female) HHT1 relatives and in 97 (mean age 47 ± 14 y; 52% female) HHT2 relatives. TTCE showed a pulmonary RLS in 78 (85%) HHT1- and 34 (35%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P < .0001). In HHT1 relatives, 29 of 53 (55%) PAVMs and in HHT2 relatives three of 17 (18%) PAVMS were treated, resulting in a PPV of TTCE for treatable PAVMs of 36.3% and 8.3%, respectively. The accompanying NPV was 100%. A minimal, moderate, or large shunt was present in 12 (13%), 24 (26%), and 42 (46%) HHT1-related, and in 20 (21%), 6 (6%), and 8 (8%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P for trend < .0001). A large shunt predicted treatable PAVMs in 55.8% of HHT1 relatives and 37.5% of HHT2 relatives. TTCE was positive in four (6%) of 63 persons without HHT. A pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in HHT1- compared with HHT2-related mutation carriers. Shunt grading is helpful to predict treatable PAVMs, particularly in the HHT2 group. TTCE is also positive in a small fraction of persons without HHT.

"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often present with recurrent anemia because of epistaxis or GI bleeding in relation to telangiectases mostly located in the stomach or small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood. To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Prospective, descriptive study. Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007. This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy investigation. Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences. Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7%) and 26 (86.7%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7% of patients. Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation. This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.

"	"Hepatic involvement occurs in up to 74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and is characterized by a spectrum of arteriovenous malformations. Three different types of intrahepatic shunting may be present: hepatic artery to hepatic veins, hepatic artery to portal vein, and portal vein to hepatic vein. Hepatic involvement in HHT may lead to biliary ischemia, portal hypertension, or high-output cardiac failure (HOCF). Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as the only definitive curative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hepatic involvement due to HHT after OLT with respect to mortality, cardiac and hepatic status, epistaxis, and quality of life. Patients with HHT and severe hepatic vascular malformations who underwent OLT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit (LLTU) from 1993 to 2007 were followed at the LLTU and the French Reference Center for HHT. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. There were 13 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria of the study (12 women and 1 man). The mean age at the time of OLT was 51.8 years (range = 33-65 years). Indications for OLT were cardiac failure (n = 9), biliary necrosis (n = 2), both cardiac failure and biliary necrosis (n = 1), and hemobilia (n = 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 109 months (range = 1-200 months). Twelve patients (92.3%) are still alive. For the 9 patients with HOCF, the mean cardiac index decreased from 5.4 L/minute/m(2) before OLT to 3.0 L/minute/m(2) after OLT. No severe hepatic complications were observed after OLT. Nine of the surviving patients (75%) experienced dramatic improvements in epistaxis and quality of life, including an ability to undertake more physical activity. In conclusion, OLT is an important therapeutic option for patients with HHT who have severe hepatic involvement. In the reported cohort, the mortality after OLT for this indication was low.

Germline mutations in two genes, endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ACVRL1), have been implicated in this disease. This report describes molecular diagnosis in a consecutive series of 600 individuals with clinical features of HHT disease. Each coding exon and flanking intronic regions of ENG and ACVRL1 genes was sequenced. Exonic copy number was quantified in probands without a coding sequence mutation. Novel nonsynonymous variants were further analyzed to predict functional consequences. In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and haplotypes for the two genes were compared between individuals with and without mutations. The highest mutation detection rate (87% [95% CI 80.2-91.5]) was observed in probands who met all four Curacao criteria (epistaxis, telangiectases, AVMs and family history). More than 30% of identified mutations were novel; however, only 6% were variants of unknown significance. Determining the significance of novel mutations as related to disease presents additional challenges. Detection of multiple alterations in the same proband also requires careful evaluation for disease association. In conclusion, the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands in this group do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of these two genes. This suggests alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation or involvement of alternate loci, and it requires further investigation.

"	"Brain abscesses occur in 5 to 13 % of patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), more often present in Rendu-Osler-Weber disease or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of headache for 2 months before acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever. CT-scan and MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion. A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved. CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after coil embolization. He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A second embolization was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke.

"	"We describe the case of a 57 year-old woman with NSTE ACS, a history of recurrent and prolonged epistaxis, and low prior cardiovascular risk. Additional findings revealed anemia and an aneurysm in her central nervous system. During her hospital stay, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was diagnosed. After application of two antiplatelet drugs, the patient was scheduled for coronarography, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting. During her hospital stay, only a minor episode of epistaxis was observed. We conclude that anemization due to HTT may significantly accelerate the progress of ischemic heart disease, resulting in acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, coronarography preceded by routine application of two antiplatelet drugs seems not to increase the risk of hemorrhage in HHT patients complicated with myocardial infarction.

"	"This case report describes a lady who underwent investigations as a part of a clinical study. A 32-year-old woman with a history of episodes of severe migraine with aura, deep vein thrombosis and recurrent epistaxis, presented with two episodes of stroke with no particular cause evident on routine investigations. A contrast echocardiogram demonstrated a patent foramen ovale (PFO). She was found to be positive for the Factor V Leiden mutation. The PFO was closed percutaneously. However, a substantial right to left shunt of 14% persisted. Pulmonary angiography revealed multiple arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) and she was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The AVMs were embolized and she has had no further cerebral events. Interestingly, her episodes of 'migraine' have also improved dramatically following the closure of the PFO and the embolization of the AVMs. This case demonstrates the complex relationship between right to left shunts, cryptogenic stroke and migraine.

21290179	"Natural history and outcome of hepatic vascular malformations in a large cohort of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disease characterized by teleangiectasias involving virtually every organ. There are limited data in the literature regarding the natural history of liver vascular malformations in hemorrhagic telangiectasia and their associated morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study sought to assess the outcome of liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients. We analyzed 16 years of surveillance data from a tertiary hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center in Italy. We considered for inclusion in this study 502 consecutive Italian patients at risk of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who presented at the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center and underwent a multidisciplinary screening protocol for the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Of the 502 individuals assessed in the center, 154 had hepatic vascular malformations and were the subject of the study; 198 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and without hepatic vascular malformations were the controls. Additionally, we report the response to treatment of patients with complicated hepatic vascular malformations. The 154 patients were included and followed for a median period of 44 months (range 12-181); of these, eight (5.2%) died from VM-related complications and 39 (25.3%) experienced complications. The average incidence rates of death and complications were 1.1 and 3.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. The median overall survival and event-free survival after diagnosis were 175 and 90 months, respectively. The rate of complete response to therapy was 63%. This study shows that substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with liver vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients.

21310938	"Immunosuppressor FK506 increases endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression and modulates transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in endothelial cells
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Patients show severe epistaxis, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency. No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies. We report the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression. The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after hepatic failure due to a liver arteriovenous malformation. The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection. After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external telangiectases, epistaxes, and anemia disappeared. Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation.

In 32 successive patients presenting with recurrent HHT epistaxis 25-100 mg of Bevacizumab was applied intranasally either as a submucosal injection or as a topical spray between November 2008 and May 2010. In many of the injected patients, the Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment efficacy. All 32 treated patients were contacted with pre- and posttreatment epistaxis severity scores (ESS) compared. Seventeen patients received topical Bevacizumab, 10 patients received a submucosal injection, and 5 patients received both. In addition, 12 patients were also treated with the KTP laser at the time of their submucosal injection. In the pretreatment period the average ESS was 7.0 (SD = 2.1), whereas in the posttreatment group the average ESS was 2.9 (SD = 1.7). This represents a significant improvement in epistaxis severity (P < .0001). In HHT patients intranasal Bevacizumab, applied as a topical spray or a submucosal injection, significantly improves epistaxis as measured by the Epistaxis Severity Score.

In many of the injected patients, the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment complications. Of the 58 treated patients 52 were contacted. Patient surveys were performed 1.5 to 46 months following their initial Bevacizumab treatment. Within the treatment population, five patients had sustained a septal perforation. Notably, these patients were treated early in the study period at which time the cartilaginous septum was often both injected and lasered. Subsequently, the treatment protocol was changed and the cartilaginous septum was neither lasered nor injected. After these changes were made no additional septal perforations were identified. No other adverse events were associated with intranasal Bevacizumab treatment. Bevacizumab applied as either a submucosal injection or as a topical nasal spray, with or without application of the KTP laser, is a safe treatment regimen. Still, when Bevacizumab injections are performed, the cartilaginous nasal septum should be avoided as patients may develop septal perforations.

21706320	"Efficiency of laser treatment in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Earlier studies have shown the effect of laser treatment on epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). At the present time, only very few prospective trials have been performed, and many studies are based on patients' subjective assessment of the severity of epistaxis. This prospective study measures the objective effect of laser treatment in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis. We introduce an objective measure to assess the severity of epistaxis: the bleeding time (BT). Before and after treatment, the quality of life, as measured by the patient, was assessed and compared to normative data. In 30 patients, we measured the BT before laser treatment 1.5 and 6.5 months after treatment. The Short form 36 (SF-36), a validated health questionnaire, was completed before and 6.5 months after treatment. Compared to preoperative value, BT was significantly reduced 1.5 and 6.5 months after laser treatment (p < 0.05) in both cases. No significant difference in quality of life, before and after treatment, was found. The quality of life of the HHT patients was reduced in five out of eight dimensions when compared with the Danish background population. Laser treatment reduces epistaxis in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis for at least 6 months; this group of patients have reduced quality of life compared to the background population.

21764776	"ChIP-seq reveals cell type-specific binding patterns of BMP-specific Smads and a novel binding motif
"	"Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Epistaxis is often the first and foremost symptom of the disease and recurrent epistaxis is the main complaint. Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of endovascular treatment of epistaxis in HHT patients. Between June 2004 and January 2008, 14 patients with HHT underwent embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches due to severe epistaxis. There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) or embospheres in diameter of 500-700-µm were used as an embolic material. Embolization was technically successful in 11 (78.5%) patients. Immediate, complete control of bleeding was achieved in 12 (85%) patients. During long-term follow-up recurrent nasal bleeding occurred in six (43%) patients 6-24 months after treatment. There were no severe complications after embolization. Nine patients experienced mild facial pain which resolved within three days after the treatment. Three patients in whom arterial spasm was observed, suffered from facial paraesthesia lasting for 3-5 days after embolization. Out of 14 patients, 12 were available for 24-month follow-up evaluation. All except one claimed reduction in frequency and severity of epistaxis which had a positive impact on their quality of life. Endovascular embolization of epistaxis in patients with HHT is an effective and safe procedure although it cannot provide a long-term cure in most cases. Embolization reduces the frequency, severity and duration of nasal bleeding in patients with HHT, improving patients' quality of life.

Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia and severe, recurrent epistaxis is a common clinical phenotype associated with HHT. An intranasal treatment regime of diluted Avastin™ (Bevacizumab; recombinant humanized anti-vascular epithelial growth factor immunoglobin G1) using apulsatile nasal irrigator has proven efficacious in clinical practice. However, concerns regarding the stability of Avastin™ following dilution and prolonged storage in standard containers used for drug delivery, such as polyethylene bottles, have so far prevented a more widespread clinical use. Compatibility with the preservative benzalkonium chloride was also unknown. This study aimed at determining, whether dilution, prolonged refrigerated storage and the presence of the preservative benzalkonium chloride - as required for novel Avastin™ formulations - affected the biochemical and electrochemical properties of the drug. We performed a detailed biochemical and electrochemical analysis of Avastin™, including native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isoelectric focusing. We did not detect any evidence of degeneration or aggregation following dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage or from the presence of benzalkonium chloride. All biochemical and electrochemical properties of Avastin™ after dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage were undistinguishable from control. Our data provide important insight into the stability of Avastin™ and allow the consideration of novel Avastin™ formulations, including its use in a metered-dose nasal spray for the treatment of HHT and other applications.

The presentation, treatment and syndromes associated with pAVF in children are reported here. A pediatric database for pAVF was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%). Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh. Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. The patient was treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months. Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited mucocutaneous disease characterized by recurrent epistaxis, lesions on skin and oral mucosa, and arteriovenous malformations of the soft tissues. This article describes the treatment of a 64-year-old woman with a bleeding nodule, which was diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation of the gingival mucosa. She was treated using sclerotherapy. Patients with HHT can be treated in the dental office and vascular malformations of these patients can be successfully managed with sclerotherapy, which eliminates the need for invasive surgical procedures and the possibility of postsurgical complications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular development resulting in direct connections between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing capillaries. Symptoms and signs can appear throughout life and marked intrafamilial variability confounds diagnosis based purely on clinical criteria. We set out to determine the impact of genetic testing on the cost of screening for HHT in at-risk relatives. We performed economic modeling of idealized pedigrees following two scenarios: repeated clinical screening until an HHT diagnosis could be either affirmed or excluded, and mutation testing in the proband, followed by genetic testing of at-risk relatives and clinical monitoring of only those relatives who test positive for the familial mutation. Based on actual reimbursement data from our region's largest health insurer, the molecular diagnostic model saved over $22,000 for a family with four relatives at risk for the initial diagnostic work-up. For a cohort of 100 probands, the total savings for the molecular diagnostic model over a reasonable period of follow-up was greater than $9 million. In this idealized setting in which all probands and at-risk relatives accepted molecular testing, the economic advantages of genetic screening over repeated clinical screening are substantial.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes. A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

22553411	"Gastric angiodysplasia in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 patient
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited disease that occurs in approximately one in 5000 to 8000 people. Clinical diagnosis of HHT is made when a person presents three of the following four criteria: family history, recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years. A genetic study revealed a mutation in exon 3 of ALK1 (c.199C > T; p.Arg67Trp) in the proband and his eldest son presenting epistaxis.

22622516	"BMP9 induces EphrinB2 expression in endothelial cells through an Alk1-BMPRII/ActRII-ID1/ID3-dependent pathway: implications for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type II
"	"ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.

HHT is mainly caused by mutations in the ENG- or ALK1-genes and associated with a shorter life span. 90% of patients have recurrent nosebleeds. 66 individuals affected of HHT participated in this cross-sectional study, completing questions due to demographic variables, Experience of illness, COPE, BHS and HADS. X(2) test, bivariate correlations with Pearson r and hierarchical multiple regression were used using PASW 18. Experience of illness made the highest variance in anxiety, depression and hopelessness and the coping strategy ""behavioral disengagement"" seems to have a mediating role between nose bleedings, being afraid of complications, satisfied with life and psychological distress. Experience of illness is of big importance in psychological distress in individuals affected of HHT, and behavioral disengagement explained the actual relationship between experience of illness and psychological distress.

Hormonal treatment with oestrogen and progestagens is still controversial based on contradictory results from two randomised clinical trials. Although somatostatin and its long-acting analogue, octreotide, have been reported to be beneficial in preventing rebleeding, there is no consensus on this type of treatment. This case report shows how the combination of ethinyloestradiol and norethisterone markedly reduced the need for blood transfusions with few side effects in one patient; in comparison, octreotide seems less effective but this could be related to a worsening of the disease.

"	"A 42-year-old woman was referred with a bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, varices in the fundus of the stomach and portal hypertension of unknown primary. Ultrasound examinations showed splenomegaly as well as portal hypertension. Blood examinations revealed low levels of haemoglobin. CT imaging showed multiple arteriovenous malformations with arterioportal shunts within the liver which led to a volume-induced portal hypertension. The genetic analysis revealed no mutations in the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 or endoglin genes. The patient was clinically diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Because of the multiple arterioportal shunts within the liver and the resulting portal hypertension with live-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, the only therapeutic option for the patient is liver transplantation. Therefore, an application for a standard exception was made at Eurotransplant and the patient is going to be liver transplantated within the next months. Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease which leads to arteriovenous malformations and which can affect different organ systems.

And the patients were diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic analyzed criteria of HHT, the ACVRL1 gene screened and the conservation of mutation protein. Three probands and 1 patient were diagnostic for HHT and 2 patients were suspected. In family I, there was a missense mutation of ACVRL1 gene in c.287A > G on 2 patients, leading to the transferal of amino acids from Asn to Ser at 96(th) place. In family II, there was a missense mutation of c.1271C > T on ACVRL1 in 2 patients, leading to the transfer of amino acids from Pro to Leu at 424(th) place. In family III, there was a deletion mutation of c.147delC on ACVRL1 so as to produce only the former 53 amino acids of ALK1 protein. Through an analysis of multi-species conservation, the mutations were conserved between multiple species. By querying the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, we confirmed that the mutation was not of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genetic screening of HHT patients may identify their virulence gene. And genetic screening of their offspring is helpful for the early diagnosis and prevention before disease onset.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by systemic vascular diseases mainly shown as arterio-visnous fistula (AVF). Here, we presented a 29-year-old woman with HHT complicated with migraine with aura (MWA) and vertigo. At the age of twelve years, she developed migraine with visual aura. At that time, migraine attacks were seen three times a year. At the age of 29 years, she also developed speech disturbance as migraine aura. At the ages of 20 and 29 years, she repeatedly suffered from positional vertigo attacks for a month. Physical examination revealed dilation of the capillary vessels at tongue, soft palate, and nasal mucosa and AVFs were located in the upper cervical cord, parietal lobe, and bilateral lungs. These clinical findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of HHT. Embolization of pulmonary AVF decreased the frequency of migraine attacks during 2-year follow-up after the embolization. The frequency of migraine in patients with HHT is higher than that of general population as well as the prevalence of vertigo. Therefore, MWA and vertigo presented in the patient with HHT suggests that there is a common pathological mechanism of dysfunction of endothelial cells and R-L shunt, among HHT, MWA, and vertigo.

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications.

Nine to 16% of patients with HHT harbor brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can cause intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective was to study clinical manifestations of brain AVMs in patients with HHT and correlate these with the specific gene mutated. We reviewed records of 171 patients with HHT and brain AVMs. A history of ICH was found in 27% (41/152) patients, with a mean age of 26 ± 18 range, (0-68) years. All of patients with ICH were neurologically asymptomatic prior to ICH. Multiple brain AVMs were found in 23% (170/39) of patients on initial examination. Genetic test results were available in 109 (64%) patients. Mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 were present in 75 (69%), 18 (17%), and 2 (2%), respectively. A history of ICH was reported in 24% of patients with an ENG mutation and 27% of patients with an ACVRL1 mutation, with a mean age of 26 ± 16 (range, 2-50) and 18 ± 21 (0-48) years, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age at first brain AVM diagnosis, prevalence of ICH history, age at ICH, or other manifestations of brain AVMs were observed among gene groups. In conclusion, no evidence for differences in brain AVM characteristics was observed among HHT gene groups, although we cannot exclude clinically important differences.

"	"SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

A 70-year-old female with a history of HHT presented to an outside hospital with bleeding into the nasopharynx 2 months after undergoing a modified Young's procedure at an unaffiliated institution. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and transferred to our facility. Due to persistent epistaxis and need for airway protection, the patient was intubated and her throat was packed. She also developed aspiration pneumonia and hypotensive shock requiring vasopressors. Twenty-four hours following bilateral internal maxillary and sphenopalatine artery embolization, she developed significant epistaxis requiring reversal of the Young's procedure on the left and placement of an anterior-posterior pack at the bedside. Upon packing removal several days later in the operating room, she was noted to have significant bleeding that necessitated reversal of the Young's procedure on the right side to obtain adequate exposure and hemostasis.

HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests. HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder causing mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered an uncommon complication of HHT whose impact on the survival of these patients is currently unknown. From January 1995 to December 2008, 29 hospitalized patients with definite HHT were included and followed until January 2011. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. PH was classified according to echocardiographic probability. A CT angiogram was performed in 24 of the 29 patients with HHT and AVMs were detected in 16 of them (67%): hepatic in 58%, pulmonary in 33% and spinal in 3%; 37% had both pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 21 patients. PH was considered possible in 4 (14%) and probable in 9 (31%). The mean age at diagnosis was lower in patients with PH than in patients without PH (54±16.5 years vs 73±8.8 years, p=0.002). PH was more prevalent in patients with AVMs (56 vs. 23%, p=0.036). The mean follow-up of the entire cohort was 6±4.4 years (range: 2 months-17 years), during this time 18 patients died (62%; mean age 73±8.1 years). Patients with PH died at a younger age (68±8.4 vs. 79±2.7 years, p=0.015) than those without PH. PH is a severe condition that significantly reduces survival on HHT patients. PH should be suspected in all HHT patients with dyspnea and hepatic AVMs.

Chest computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that he had a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. He had experienced epistaxis when he was a junior high school student, and since then, the symptom had frequently recurred. Further, he had telangiectasia on the lips. Thus, he was given a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Endoscopy revealed gastric telangiectasia, and in addition, his colon had many juvenile polyps. When he was 49 years of age, he underwent genetic analysis for HHT. A diagnosis of juvenile polyposis-HHT combined syndrome (JP-HHT) was made since a heterozygous germline 4-base deletion in exon 9 of SMAD4 was detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of JP-HHT associated with SMAD4 mutation in Japan.

Our aim is to show that echocardiography is a good tool to evaluate the severity of hepatic vascular malformations in HHT and can improve medical management in HHT patients. The study is a cross-sectional study of cardiac parameters in HHT patients with dyspnea in a single referral center. All HHT patients with dyspnea, consecutively seen at HHT reference center in Lyon between May 2007 and November 2009 were included and had hepatic vascular Ultrasound and Echocardiography. Echocardiographic measures included cardiac output (CO) and index (CI), left ventricle (LV) filling pressures, and pulmonary artery pressure. Then, patients were classified in 4 groups according to the severity: group 1 (normal values), group 2 with isolated high CI, group 3 with high CI and increased LV-filling pressures and group 4 with increased LV-filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-two HHT-patients were analyzed. Eight patients were in group 1, 25 in group 2, 6 in group 3 and 13 in group 4. Age, NYHA class dyspnea, edema, atrial fibrillation, hepatic artery diameter, and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels significantly increased from groups 1 to 4 as well as left atrial area, and presence of mitral regurgitation. Patients with associated pulmonary VMs (n=11) did not show any clinical or echocardiographic differences. Performing echocardiography in HHT patients with dyspnea allowed us to better understand the physiological processes of high-CO failure complicating liver vascular malformations and may improve follow-up of patients and treatment decisions.

Three out of four criteria are required for a definite clinical diagnosis HHT, two criteria are considered ""possible"" HHT, and 0 or 1 criterion makes the diagnosis unlikely. However, these consensus diagnostic criteria have not been validated. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical criteria. A total of 450 consecutive persons ≥16 years of age were screened for HHT between May 2004 and September 2009, including a chest CT to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We selected 263 first-degree relatives of disease-causing mutation carriers who underwent mutation analysis. Genetic test results were considered the gold standard. The family mutation was present in 186 patients (mean age 42.9 ± 14.6 yr; 54.8% female). A clinical diagnosis was definite, ""possible"", and unlikely in 168 (90.3%), 17 (9.1%), and 1 (0.5%) patient, respectively. In 77 persons the family mutation was absent (mean age 37.1 ± 12.3 yr, 59.7% female). In this group a clinical diagnosis was definite, possible, and unlikely in 0, 35 (45.5%), and 42 (54.5%) persons, respectively. The positive predictive value of a definite clinical diagnosis was 100% (95% CI 97.8-100), the negative predictive value of an unlikely diagnosis 97.7% (95% CI 87.9-99.6). Of 52 patients with ""possible"" HHT, 17 (32.7%) displayed an HHT-causing mutation. The Curaçao clinical criteria have a good diagnostic performance.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1 account for around 85% of cases, and 10% are large deletions and duplications. Here we present a large novel deletion in ACVRL1 gene and its molecular characterization in a 3 generation Italian family. We employed short tandem repeats (STRs) analysis, direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, and 'deletion-specific' PCR methods. STRs Analysis at ENG and ACVRL1 loci suggested a positive linkage for ACVRL1. Direct sequencing of this gene did not identify any mutations, while MLPA identified a large deletion. These results were confirmed and exactly characterized with a 'deletion-specific' PCR: the deletion size is 4,594 bp and breakpoints in exon 3 and intron 8 show the presence of short direct repeats of 7 bp [GCCCCAC]. We hypothesize, as causative molecular mechanism, the replication slippage model. Understanding the fine mechanisms associated with genomic rearrangements may indicate the nonrandomness of these events, highlighting hot spots regions. The complete concordance among MLPA, STRs analysis and 'deletion-specific PCR' supports the usefulness of MLPA in HHT molecular analysis.

Retrospective chart review of 55 consecutive HHT patients undergoing a bevacizumab injection for recalcitrant epistaxis. Nineteen patients received local injections to only the SP vasculature, and 36 patients received AP and SP injections. Main outcome variable was estimated blood loss during nasal surgery. Independent variables included sex, age, epistaxis severity score, surgical techniques (including laser), and blood pressure parameters (baseline, preinduction, and postintubation). The mean blood loss in HHT patients receiving SP injections alone was 111 mL, whereas it was 22 mL for those receiving both AP + SP injections. This difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = .075). Blood pressure parameters were similar in both groups with no appreciable difference between intraoperative systolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The addition of either sublabial or transcutaneous AP injection to the standard SP block markedly reduces blood loss in HHT epistaxis nasal surgery.

23702711	"Three-dimensional co-cultures of human endothelial cells and embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes inside a microfluidic device
"	"Organs-on-chips are microengineered in vitro tissue structures that can be used as platforms for physiological and pathological research. They provide tissue-like microenvironments in which different cell types can be co-cultured in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ mimics. Blood vessels are an integral part of all tissues in the human body. Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of organs-on-chips since generated tissues will require a blood or nutrient supply. Here, we have engineered three-dimensional constructs of vascular tissue inside microchannels by injecting a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells) and rat tail collagen I into a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel with dimensions 500 μm × 120 μm × 1 cm (w × h × l). Over the course of 12 h, the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the channel. Detailed examination of tube morphology by confocal microscopy revealed a mature endothelial monolayer with complete PECAM-1 staining at cell-cell contacts and pericytes incorporated inside the tubular structures. We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for normal vascular development; deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and mutations in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic diseases. In the engineered microvessels, inhibition of TGF-β signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher tortuosity, highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). In summary, we have developed microengineered three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell types. In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue constructs to advance the development of organs-on-chips.

23800974	"MiR-205 is downregulated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and impairs TGF-beta signaling pathways in endothelial cells
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.

23805858	"HHT diagnosis by Mid-infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural network analysis
"	"The vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is in general an inherited disease caused by mutations in the TGF-β/BMP receptors endoglin or ALK1 or in rare cases by mutations of the TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad4 leading to the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT. HHT is characterized by several clinical symptoms like spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases at sites like lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose, and visceral lesions like gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations. The disease shows an inter- and intra-family variability in penetrance as well as symptoms from mild to life threatening. Penetrance is also depending on age. Diagnosis of the disease is based on the presence of some of the listed symptoms or by genetic testing. HHT diagnosis is laborious, time consuming, costly and sometimes uncertain. Not all typical symptoms may be present, especially at a younger age, and genetic testing does not always identify the disease causing mutation. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was investigated as a potential alternative to the current diagnostic methods. IR-spectra were obtained by Fourier-transform Mid-IR spectroscopy from blood plasma from HHT patients and a healthy control group. Spectral data were mathematically processed and subsequently classified and analysed by artificial neural network (ANN) analyses and by visual analysis of scatter plots of the dominant principal components. The analyses showed that for HHT a disease specific IR-spectrum exists that is significantly different from the control group. Furthermore, at the current stage with the here used methods, HHT can be diagnosed by Mid-IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%. Visual analysis of PCA scatter plots revealed an inter class variation of the HHT group. IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis can be considered to be a serious alternative diagnostic method compared to clinical and genetically based methods. Blood plasma is an ideal candidate for diagnostic purposes, it is inexpensive, easy to isolate and only minimal amounts are required. In addition, IR-spectroscopy measurement times are fast, less than one minute, and diagnosis is not based on interpretation of may be uncertain clinical data. And last but not least, the method is inexpensive.

"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels, with shunting of blood from the arterial to venous circulation and a high risk of rupture and intracranial hemorrhage. Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM. A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM. We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis.

"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease.

Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. 4.

24499751	"Outcomes of pregnancy in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"To describe pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a retrospective descriptive study of women with HHT (18-55 years of age) from the Toronto HHT Database using a telephone questionnaire regarding pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.

A method to map out the microvasculature malformation of skin based on the time-domain histograms of individual pixels is presented with results obtained from both normal skin and skin containing vascular malformation. Results demonstrated that this method can potentially map out deeper blood vessels and enhance the visualization of microvasculature in low signal regions, while being resistant against motion (e.g., patient tremor or internal reflex movements). The overall results are manifested as more uniform en face projection maps of microvessels.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is universally accepted as an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which represents telangiectasia is frequently multiple AVMs in internal organs. Very few non-HHT cases were diagnosed as cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We report one case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs diagnosed as non-HHT to share our experience. This report aims to find the way of identifying non-HHT case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs in early periods. To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.

"	"Targeted ultrasound contrast imaging has the potential to become a reliable molecular imaging tool. A better understanding of the quantitative aspects of molecular ultrasound technology could facilitate the translation of this technique to the clinic for the purposes of assessing vascular pathology and detecting individual response to treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether targeted ultrasound contrast-enhanced imaging can provide a quantitative measure of endogenous biomarkers. Endoglin, an endothelial biomarker involved in the processes of development, vascular homeostasis, and altered in diseases, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 and tumor angiogenesis, was the selected target. We used a parallel plate perfusion chamber in which endoglin-targeted (MBE), rat isotype IgG2 control and untargeted microbubbles were perfused across endoglin wild-type (Eng+/+), heterozygous (Eng+/-) and null (Eng-/-) embryonic mouse endothelial cells and their adhesion quantified. Microbubble binding was also assessed in late-gestation, isolated living transgenic Eng+/- and Eng+/+ embryos. Nonlinear contrast-specific ultrasound imaging performed at 21 MHz was used to collect contrast mean power ratios for all bubble types. Statistically significant differences in microbubble binding were found across genotypes for both in vitro (p<0.05) and embryonic studies (p<0.001); MBE binding was approximately twofold higher in Eng+/+ cells and embryos compared with their Eng+/- counterparts. These results suggest that molecular ultrasound is capable of reliably differentiating between molecular genotypes and relating receptor densities to quantifiable molecular ultrasound levels.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by vascular malformations. The genes known to be associated with HHT include ENG (HHT1), ACVRL1 (HHT2) and SMAD4 (JPHT). It has been reported that circulating CD34(+) cell subsets repair damaged vessels. To investigate whether mobilization of these cells is present in the peripheral blood (PB) of HTT patients, we analyzed CD34(+) cells, CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+) progenitor or mature endothelial cells, and CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed in 150 HTT patients and 43 healthy subjects (CTRLs). In HTT patients, PB CD34(+) cells were significantly increased; the frequency of endothelial cells was higher (P = 0.002), while the frequency of CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) HPCs was lower (P = 0.00007) than in CTRLs. Results were comparable in patients with ENG or ACVRL1 gene mutation; in patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of the cell subsets inversely correlated with the age of the patients at time of sampling (CD34(+)), disease duration (CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+)), and age at disease onset (CD34(+)CD133(+) VEGFR-2(-)). In conclusion, HHT patients show an increase of circulating endothelial cells and a decrease of HPCs. In patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of CD34(+) endothelial cells correlates with specific clinical characteristics suggesting that their active turnover characterizes the initial phase of the disease.

Demographic, clinical, genotypic, and imaging information of 75 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with brain arteriovenous malformations enrolled in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium from 2010 to 2012 were reviewed. Nonshunting, small, superficially located conglomerates of enhancing vessels without enlarged feeding arteries or draining veins called ""capillary vascular malformations"" were the most commonly observed lesion (46 of 75 patients; 61%), followed by shunting ""nidus-type"" brain AVMs that were typically located superficially with a low Spetzler-Martin Grade and a small size (32 of 75 patients; 43%).

"	"Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by vascular malformations (VMs) and caused by mutations in TGFβ/BMP9 pathway genes, most commonly ENG or ACVRL1. Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype.

However, most published cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias. We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also long-term survival of those with the disease. From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis (OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at death 3 years younger. Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is required.

Unfortunately, many suspected patients do not present a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes, prompting the need to investigate additional biomarkers of the disease. Here, several HHT biomarkers and novel methodological approaches developed during the last years will be reviewed. On one hand, products detected in plasma or serum samples: soluble proteins (vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor β1, soluble endoglin, angiopoietin-2) and microRNA variants (miR-27a, miR-205, miR-210). On the other hand, differential HHT gene expression fingerprinting, next generation sequencing of a panel of genes involved in HHT, and infrared spectroscopy combined with artificial neural network patterns will also be reviewed.

"	"Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.

25931195	"Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by abnormal vascular structures that may present as epistaxis, telangiectasias, and/or arteriovenous malformations. The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGFβ pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGFβ signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations.

25940942	"Prevalence and nature of dyspnea in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder associated with pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), present in about 30-50% of patients. Dyspnea is frequently reported by about one-half of patients with PAVMs and has been related to the degree of right to left shunting. However, many HHT patients with PAVMs remain asymptomatic and those without PAVMs have been observed to have dyspnea, the cause of which has not been characterized. The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of dyspnea and its etiology in the HHT population. Retrospective review of over 1000 patients at an HHT Center of Excellence from 1997 to 2010. Patients were categorized as definite HHT if they met ≥3 clinical diagnostic criteria or had a positive genetic diagnosis. Patients were unlikely to have HHT (non-HHT) if they had 1 or fewer diagnostic criteria. Data on dyspnea prevalence (MMRC ≥ 1), PAVMs, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, symptomatic liver venous malformations, anemia and obesity was reviewed. 506 patients were categorized as having HHT, of which 202 (40%) had confirmed PAVMs. Dyspnea prevalence was 35% (178/506) vs. 18% (50/284, p < 0.0001) in the HHT and non-HHT patients, respectively. With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of dyspnea (MMRC ≥1) was 3.45 (95% CI 2.08-5.71) with the presence of PAVMs in HHT patients. Other independent predictors of dyspnea were older age, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, anemia, and obesity. Prevalence of dyspnea is significant, evident in about one-third of HHT patients, often associated with PAVMs. It is important to consider other etiologies for dyspnea when assessing patients with HHT.

In most families (~85%), HHT is caused by mutations in the ENG (HHT1) or the ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes. Here, we report the results of genetic testing of 113 Norwegian families with suspected or definite HHT. Variants in ENG and ACVRL1 were found in 105 families (42 ENG, 63 ACVRL1), including six novel variants of uncertain pathogenic significance. Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway. We discuss the importance of founder mutations and present a thorough evaluation of missense and splice-site variants.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is an autosomic dominant disorder, which is characterized by the development of multiple arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may either rupture or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism causing stroke or cerebral abscess. Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease. Early diagnosis is important to avoid complications from vascular lesions, but diagnosis is difficult in asymptomatic patients. A 69-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of hepatic vascular malformations. He had mild anemia with iron deficiency, and dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant arteriovenous and arterioportal shunts throughout the liver. Telangiectasia from the pharynx to the duodenum was confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient history revealed episodes of epistaxis as well as a family history of epistaxis. He was diagnosed with HHT, although no other family member had been diagnosed with definite HHT. A diagnosis of HHT must be considered in patients with hepatic vascular malformations.

"	"The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients. Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.

"	"A subset of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develops pulmonary hypertension (PH) by mechanisms including pulmonary arterial hypertension, high flow, and elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare clinical condition with abnormal direct communication between the branches of pulmonary artery and vein. It may occur as an isolated anomaly or in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Although these vascular pulmonary pathologies are quite uncommon, they are the important part of the differential diagnosis of common pulmonary problems such as hypoxemia and pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis of PAVM in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is a disorder that affects 1:5000-1:10,000 people worldwide, with an estimated 60,000 affected individuals in the USA. Approximately 50 % of patients with HHT experience potentially life-threatening health complications such as stroke, brain abscess, or heart failure. However, the most common symptom is spontaneous and frequent nosebleeding. HHT is a hereditary condition with significant health consequences, but little is known about how individuals cope with HHT on a daily basis and how individuals share information about the disorder with social groups outside of the family. The objectives of this study were to improve understanding of the daily experiences of patients with diagnosed HHT and to investigate how they disclose their diagnosis to various social groups (friends, dating partners, employers, and coworkers) outside of their biological family. Adult patients seen at a university HHT clinic and who had been diagnosed with HHT for at least 6 months were recruited by mail. Participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 19). A qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts identified four major categories: (1) the emotional impact of HHT, (2) the social impact of HHT, (3) concerns for current and future health related to HHT, and (4) social context drives disclosure of HHT. Participants reported that although HHT was a manageable hereditary disorder, the symptoms negatively affected their daily life. It is important for health care providers to understand how individuals with rare genetic disorders are managing.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials. 4.

"	"Hepatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However, when present, clinical manifestations can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Current expertise in the variable clinical manifestations and recommendations for diagnostic approach and management of hepatic involvement in HHT are outlined. A review of current literature was performed using the MEDLINE search string: ""Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL] AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL])"". Due to the lack of therapeutic consequence, systematic screening for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic patients with HHT is currently not recommended. In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established.

The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

"	"The circulatory system is walled off by different cell types, including vascular mural cells and podocytes. The interaction and interplay between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes, play a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is an RGD-containing counter-receptor for β1 integrins and is highly expressed by ECs during angiogenesis. We find that the adhesion between vascular ECs and mural cells is enhanced by integrin activators and inhibited upon suppression of membrane endoglin or β1-integrin, as well as by addition of soluble endoglin (SolEng), anti-integrin α5β1 antibody or an RGD peptide. Analysis of different endoglin mutants, allowed the mapping of the endoglin RGD motif as involved in the adhesion process. In Eng (+/-) mice, a model for hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia type 1, endoglin haploinsufficiency induces a pericyte-dependent increase in vascular permeability. Also, transgenic mice overexpressing SolEng, an animal model for preeclampsia, show podocyturia, suggesting that SolEng is responsible for podocytes detachment from glomerular capillaries. These results suggest a critical role for endoglin in integrin-mediated adhesion of mural cells and provide a better understanding on the mechanisms of vessel maturation in normal physiology as well as in pathologies such as preeclampsia or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013. Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient.

We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure. The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, fatal vascular disorder. Genetic predisposition plays vital roles in the development of PAH, with most mutations being identified in genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Defects in the BMP9 gene have been documented in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the most common inherited vascular disorder, which is occasionally associated with PAH. Selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR2 with BMP9 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension. We report the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic boy who was diagnosed with severe PAH and right heart failure at 3 years of age. During his stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, treatment was initiated with inhaled nitric oxide and intravenous epoprostenol; he subsequently was transitioned to treprostinil, sildenafil, and prophylactic enoxaparin. Now, two years later, the child is asymptomatic on sildenafil, bosentan, subcutaneous treprostinil, and warfarin. Genetic screening revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the BMP9 gene (c.76C > T; p.Gln26Ter). The child had no telangiectasias or arteriovenous malformations; family history also was negative. Subsequent parental testing showed both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation, indicating that the child inherited the BMP9 mutant allele from each parent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP9 mutation in a patient with PAH. The homozygous nonsense mutation may account for the early onset and severity of PAH in this patient and also fit the 'two-hit' model we proposed previously. The absence of clinical symptoms for PAH in the parents may be due to incomplete penetrance or various expressivities of the BMP9 mutations. Our study expands the spectrum of phenotypes related to BMP9 mutations.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed the mass to be avidly enhancing. Angiography was performed and demonstrated a mild vascular blush. We report a rare case of HTT and olfactory schwannoma completely resected with a unilateral extended endoscopic endonasal approach. Reconstruction was performed with a contralateral nasoseptal flap. This is the first reported single stage fully endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach for resection of an olfactory schwannoma with preservation of the contralateral olfactory cleft. The patient's sense of smell and taste was maintained postoperatively.

26873746	"Usefulness of Transcranial Doppler for Detecting Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"The aim of this study was to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) as a screening test for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This retrospective study included suspected patients with HHT who were screened for PAVM with a TCD and a chest computed tomography (CT) study. The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.

In this study, the case of a 37-year-old female with HHT who developed a poorly differentiated jejunal adenocarcinoma five years after ileocecal resection for multiple colonic adenomas is presented. The patient underwent curative resection of the cancer invading the ileum and the mesentery of the transverse colon, but had to overcome critical complications perioperatively, stemming from HHT-associated peripheral capillary dilatation and arteriovenous malformation, including nosebleeds and possible infusion-induced air embolism through pulmonary shunts. The patient subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy including capecitabine and oxaliplatin for 6 months, and currently remains alive without any evidence of recurrence 12 months after the second surgery. This patient with SBA was an instructive case demonstrating the necessity of careful attention during major surgery in HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with a wide range of neurovascular abnormalities. The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.

27027094	"Implications of an Incidental Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation
"	"Introduction. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have been associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34-year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance. He underwent a pulmonary arteriography of the right upper and lower lobe with the use of a microcatheter system; however, the PAVM could not be visualized. Thus, he was managed medically. The patient was educated on the need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and surveillance imaging. Discussion. Our case highlights the importance of obtaining a complete past medical and family history in young patients with a history of recurrent epistaxis to elicit features of HHT. The diagnosis can be made clinically and directly affects family members, who would otherwise not receive appropriate screening.

Many procedures have been used for epistaxis control in patients with this disorder. The objective of this study was to report the treatment of severe HHT-related epistaxiswith the modified Young's procedure. We describe the treatment of 4 patients with severe blood-transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a modified Young's procedure in a tertiary hospital. The nasal closure was bilateral and complete in all cases. All patients were followed for 12 months or longer. The procedure was well tolerated and complete cessation of bleeding was achieved in all the patients. Young's technique is a safe surgical procedure, well tolerated by patients with severe epistaxis and HHT.

27081547	"Mutations in RASA1 and GDF2 identified in patients with clinical features of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, which function in regulating the transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways. Symptoms of HHT can be present in individuals who test negative for mutations in these three genes indicating other genes may be involved. In this study, we tested for mutations in two genes, RASA1 and GDF2, which were recently reported to be involved in vascular disorders. To determine whether RASA1 and GDF2 have phenotypic overlap with HHT and should be included in diagnostic testing, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to detect mutations in 93 unrelated individuals who previously tested negative for mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, but were clinically suspected to have HHT. Pathogenic mutations in RASA1 were identified in two samples (2.15%) and a variant of unknown significance in GDF2 was detected in one sample. All three individuals experienced epistaxis with dermal lesions described in medical records as telangiectases. These results indicate that the inclusion of RASA1 and GDF2 screening in individuals suspected to have HHT will increase the detection rate and aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis.

A CT scan showed haemothorax and a bleeding arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left lung. Family history suggested the possibility of HHT. After multidisciplinary consideration, a primary caesarean section was performed, followed by embolisation of the AVM during the same surgical session. The patient had a gene mutation consistent with HHT type 2. Pregnant patients with HHT are at risk of serious morbidity, especially if they are not screened for AVMs. A multidisciplinary approach for such patients, with consideration of various scenarios, is highly recommended.

We describe staged diagnosis and therapy including individual medical treatments of 97 patients with HHT. The success of treatment is monitored with a systematic questionnaire. The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy remains standard treatment of choice with no major side effects despite the need for repeated treatment. In addition new treatment strategies like nasal occlusion, local drug therapy, and nasal septal splinting show initial success. Improvement of the quality of life of HHT patients can be achieved by a multimodal concept. Several new treatment strategies like nasal septal splinting and nasal occlusion successfully expand the range of established methods. Further studies have to prove the safety and long-term effectiveness of the described individual medical treatments.

"	"An intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula(dAVF)was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old man during a medical checkup. Except for a mild episode of pneumonia at the age of 22 years, his medical history was unremarkable. He had no family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia(HHT). The dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.

"	"To evaluate if injection of intravenous particles may provoke migraines in subjects with right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Migraine headaches commonly affect people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), especially those with pulmonary AVMs that provide right-to-left shunts. In our clinical practice, patients occasionally reported acute precipitation of migraine headaches following injection of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates for nuclear medicine scans. Self-reported migraine features and exacerbations were examined in HHT subjects with and without pulmonary AVMs, for a series of noninvasive and invasive investigations, using an unbiased online survey. One hundred and sixty-six subjects were classified as having both HHT and migraines. HHT subjects with migraines were more likely to have pulmonary AVMs (P < .0001). HHT subjects with pulmonary AVMs were more likely to report photophobia (P = .010), ""flashes of light"" (P = .011), or transient visual loss (P = .040). Pulse oximetry, x-rays, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans without intravenous contrast medium rarely, if ever, provoked migraines, but unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to exacerbate migraines by 14/124 (11.2%) subjects. One hundred and fourteen subjects had both enhanced and unenhanced CT examinations: studies with contrast media were more commonly reported to start (9/114 [7.8%]), and/or worsen migraines (18/114 [15.7%]), compared to those undertaken without contrast medium (P < .01), or after simple blood tests (P < .05). Additionally, migraine exacerbation was reported by 9/90 (10%) after contrast echocardiography, 2/44 (4.5%) after nuclear medicine scans, and 10/154 (6.5%) after blood tests. HHT subjects frequently report migraine exacerbation following blood tests, contrast echocardiograms, MRI imaging, and CT studies performed with intravenous contrast medium. Since air emboli are recognized to complicate intravenous injections, particularly those given by a pressurized pump during contrast enhanced CT, future studies should re-evaluate whether particulate emboli provoke migraines.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. She denied any symptoms except recurrent epistaxis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. We performed open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.

Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

A subsequent abdominal echocardiographic exploration showed an angiomatous transformation of the liver due to diffuse lacunar enlargement of hepatic portal vein branches and arterial-venous shunts. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the echocardiographic findings. The imaging findings coupled with cutaneous and nasopharyngeal lesions were suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the diagnosis was confirmed after the identification of a mutation in the ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12. HHT is a rare but underestimated vascular disease that can affect different organs, in particular the liver, leading to organ failure requiring transplantation as occurred in our patient. Echocardiography is a useful imaging tool to exclude cardiac abnormalities as a cause of cardiomegaly and to guide the correct diagnosis of a peripheral origin of high cardiac output.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in mainly two genes, that is ENG, encoding endoglin (HHT1), or ACVRL1, encoding activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1/HHT2). HHT is characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and vascular visceral dysplasia responsible for visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). to report the experience of two university hospitals (Trousseau, Paris, and CHIC, Creteil) with screening children for HHT and pulmonary AVM (PAVM) using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). parents with confirmed HHT were offered to have their children screened for the mutation identified in their family, and informed consent was obtained. Children carrying the same mutation as their parents underwent HRCT of the chest without contrast. between 2008 and 2015, 99 children were screened for HHT mutations. Mutations were identified in 59 patients, that is 24 HHT1 and 35 HHT2. Radiologic and clinical screening was possible in 52 patients (21 HHT-1 and 31 HHT-2). Among those, PAVM was identified in 13 patients (25%; n = 8 HHT1; n = 5 HHT2), and four of them required embolization therapy. This study highlights the usefulness of genetic screening in children with known HHT family. It also suggests that a non-invasive protocol such as HRTC is an efficient approach to detect non-symptomatic lesions that are present early on in children carrying the ENG (HHT1), but also the ACVRL1 mutations (HHT2).

"	"To determine current practice regarding screening, management, and follow-up of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), particularly those with feeding arteries <3 mm in diameter, in those patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) at HHT Centers of Excellence. A 32-question survey focusing on PAVM screening, management, and follow-up was sent to 147 participants at HHT Centers worldwide. Thirty-three responses were received (22%); 60% from interventional radiologists and 20% from pulmonologists; 67% from the USA, 21% European, and 6% Asian. In HHT patients with initial negative screening echocardiogram, 60% recommended repeat screening contrast echocardiogram in 5 years, while 15% felt that no additional screening was necessary in these patients. Fifty-nine percentage reported never having seen a patient with initial negative contrast echocardiogram become positive. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms, 41% recommended contrast-enhanced CT as the next step in management, 22% recommended non-contrast CT, and 22 and 3% recommended repeat echocardiogram in 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms but no visible PAVMs, opinions regarding the use of bubble filters were evenly divided, while 79% recommended prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive procedures. Eighty percentages of respondents treat PAVMs with feeding artery less than 3 mm, and 52% treat feeders less than 2 mm. Regarding follow-up, 71% reported seeing PAVM recurrence at the site of a previously completely treated PAVM. There is inconsistency in practice regarding PAVM screening, management, and follow-up, suggesting a need for further research and guideline development.

28267932	"Hemoglobin Is a Vital Determinant of Arterial Oxygen Content in Hypoxemic Patients with Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations
"	"PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.

28297555	"Epistaxis grading in Osler's disease: comparison of comprehensive scores with detailed bleeding diaries
"	"Use of reliable grading scores to measure epistaxis severity in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is essential in clinical routine and for scientific purposes. For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.

28407366	"Screening children for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Evaluation of 18 years of experience
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with multi-systemic vascular dysplasia. Early diagnosis through screening is important to prevent serious complications. How best to screen children of affected parents for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is often subject to debate. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram (TTCE) is considered optimal in screening for PAVMs in adults. Guidelines for the screening of children are not specific, reflecting the lack of scientific evidence on the best method to use. Aims of this study are (i) to evaluate our current screening method, consisting of history, physical examination, pulse oximetry, and chest radiography and (ii) to assess whether postponing more invasive screening for PAVMs until adulthood is safe. This is a prospective observational cohort study using a patient database. Over a period of 18 years (mean follow-up 9.21 years, SD 4.72 years), 436 children from HHT families were screened consecutively. A total of 175/436 (40%) children had a diagnosis of HHT. PAVMs were detected in 39/175 (22%) children, 33/39 requiring treatment by embolotherapy. None of the screened children suffered any PAVM-associated complications with this screening method. This study shows that a conservative screening method during childhood is sufficient to detect large PAVMs and protect children with HHT for PAVM-related complications. Postponing TTCE and subsequent chest CT scanning until adulthood to detect any smaller PAVMs does not appear to be associated with major risk.

28430541	"A Comprehensive Approach to Hepatic Vascular Disease
"	"The liver has a complex vascular supply, which involves the inflow of oxygenated blood through the hepatic artery (systemic circulation) and deoxygenated blood through the portal vein (portal circulation), as well as the outflow of deoxygenated blood through the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava. A spectrum of vascular variants can involve the liver. Some of these variants may result in areas of enhancement that can mimic more serious pathologic conditions. In this article, the authors discuss a spectrum of variants and pathologic conditions that may involve the liver vasculature. These include variants, anomalies, and diseases involving the portal vein, such as rudimentary portal vein, thrombosis, cavernous transformation, thrombotic angiitis, thrombophlebitis, transient hepatic attenuation difference or transient hepatic intensity difference, portal venous aneurysm, and portal vein gas. The hepatic artery can be involved by various diseases, including thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Unusual ""third inflow"" sources of venous inflow are also discussed, including aberrant right gastric vein, aberrant left gastric vein, epigastric-paraumbilical veins, and cholecystic vein. A spectrum of variants and diseases involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, including thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, stenosis, torsion, congestive hepatopathy, and peliosis hepatis, are discussed. Vascular shunts are illustrated, including portosystemic shunts (intra- and extrahepatic), arterioportal shunt, shunts of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and acquired arteriovenous fistula. Familiarity with the pathogenesis and imaging features of these vascular entities can aid radiologic diagnoses and guide appropriate patient management. (©)RSNA, 2017.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that leads to frequent epistaxis. It can have a significant impact on quality of life. Many reports exist regarding various therapies to address the epistaxis. We presented our technique for addressing the epistaxis associated with HHT. Patients are treated in the operating room while they are under general anesthesia. A local anesthetic is injected sublabially, and oxymetazoline is dripped into the nose. The coblation wand is used to treat the telangiectasias. Bevacizumab is then injected into the nasal cavity bilaterally. The coblation wand, with or without adjunctive bevacizumab injection, is a technically feasible intervention for patients with HHT that all providers can perform.

28564608	"Structural Basis of the Human Endoglin-BMP9 Interaction: Insights into BMP Signaling and HHT1
"	"Endoglin (ENG)/CD105 is an essential endothelial cell co-receptor of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) and involved in tumor angiogenesis and preeclampsia. Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of human ENG and its complex with the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). BMP9 interacts with a hydrophobic surface of the N-terminal orphan domain of ENG, which adopts a new duplicated fold generated by circular permutation. The interface involves residues mutated in HHT1 and overlaps with the epitope of tumor-suppressing anti-ENG monoclonal TRC105. The structure of the C-terminal zona pellucida module suggests how two copies of ENG embrace homodimeric BMP9, whose binding is compatible with ligand recognition by type I but not type II receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the BMP signaling cascade, with implications for future therapeutic interventions in this fundamental pathway.

"	"Children with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) may have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, clubbing, cyanosis and hemoptysis. However, some patients with pulmonary AVMs may be asymptomatic, placing them at risk for complications such as stroke or brain abscess if they are not identified and treated. This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs. Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.

"	"Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables real-time optical biopsy. Little is known about pCLE imaging deep inside the small bowel, therefore the aim of this study was to determine its usefulness. Between April 2014 and January 2016, we performed 38 pCLE examinations during double-balloon enteroscopy with intravenous fluorescein in 37 patients with: tumors (n = 10), vascular disorders (n = 6), inflammatory diseases and drug injuries (n = 13), other disorders (n = 4), and normal findings (n = 4). We measured the calibers of capillary and lymphatic vessels at 15 different sites and compared the calibers between pCLE images and histopathology. We also compared pCLE findings with pathologic diagnosis. The inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology. In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %). pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.

"	"Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics RASA1-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. RASA1-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.

In this retrospective study, we identified all patients at our institution diagnosed with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia from 2001 to 2017. Patients who did not undergo brain MR imaging were excluded. Patient demographics, laboratory results, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease characteristics were noted. Basal ganglia hyperintensity was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively relative to the signal intensity in the ipsilateral thalami. Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available software. A total of 312 patients (41% men, 59% women; mean age, 51 ± 18 years) with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were identified. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity was present in 23.4% of patients and demonstrated a statistically significant association with older age (P < .001), increased hepatic AVMs (P < .001), high cardiac output state (P < .001), hepatic failure (P = .01), elevated peak serum alkaline phosphatase level (P = .03), and increased total bilirubin count (P = .03). There was no significant association with sex, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia genetic mutation status, parkinsonism, or serum transaminase levels. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity occurs in >23% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is associated with hepatic vascular malformations, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated cardiac output.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with agitated saline was suggestive of an extra-cardiac shunt. Subsequent chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated five large PAVMs. The patient underwent transcatheter coil embolization of the five PAVMs, resulting in marked improvement in dyspnea and resolution of the shunt on bubble study echocardiography. Although PAVMs are rare, they remain an important entity to consider when evaluating patients with extracardiac shunts. They may present with nonspecific features such as dyspnea on exertion and recurrent CVAs. All patients with multiple PAVMs should undergo thorough skin screening for telangiectasia as well as radiologic imaging to screen for additional AVMs in the liver and brain in order to exclude hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a highly debilitating and life-threatening genetic vascular disorder arising from endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and hypervascularization, for which no cure exists. Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs. Tacrolimus repurposing has therefore therapeutic potential in HHT.

"	"To investigate the clinical features and feasibility genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) family, and to explore the application of gene mutation testing in HHT diagnosis.  Methods: Medical histories and clinical features of a family were analyzed to diagnose HHT patients and suspected individuals according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family. A combination of clinical and genetic diagnosis could improve the diagnosis and treatment of HHT.

29080903	"Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions
"	"Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, we hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.

"	"We describe a family who presented with several scattered, vascular, cutaneous lesions and was found to have a novel mutation in RASA1, diagnostic of capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome. Our patient was initially given a presumptive clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome shares several features with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and hereditary benign telangiectasia, but it can be distinguished clinically according to its morphologic appearance and distribution of cutaneous vascular lesions, the presence of internal fast-flow lesions, and genetic analysis.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4. Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

29253907	"Inhibiting DPP4 in a mouse model of HHT1 results in a shift towards regenerative macrophages and reduces fibrosis after myocardial infarction
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

"	"To present a multiyear clinical experience with intravenous bevacizumab for the management of severe gastrointestinal bleeding and/or epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). All patients treated with intravenous bevacizumab for severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related bleeding from June 1, 2013, through January 31, 2017, were included in this report. Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients. Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores (P<.001) and RBC transfusion requirements (P=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function. Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship as well as clinical, genetic, and biomarker predictors of response.

Patients treated for HHT-associated epistaxis by intranasal submucosal bevacizumab injections between June 2011 and August 2013 were included and followed prospectively. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by the epistaxis severity score (ESS); the epistaxis intensity, frequency, and the need of blood transfusion (IFT) score; and hemoglobin levels. Thirty-three patients were included. The total number of treatments with intranasal bevacizumab injection was 210. The mean number of treatments per patient was 6.2 ± 4.6 (range, 1-16), and the mean treatment and observation period was 38.8 ± 21.8 months (range, 2-66 months). Four patients showed no improvement after treatment. Eleven patients (33.3%) showed initial improvement in both ESS and IFT, but the treatment was discontinued before the end of the study because the effect became gradually shorter lasting despite repeated injections. Twelve patients (36.3%) continued to have a positive response to the treatment at the end of the study. No local adverse effects were observed, but one patient developed osteonecrosis in both knees during the treatment period. Intranasal bevacizumab injection is an effective treatment for most of the moderate and severe grades of HHT-associated epistaxis. The duration of the effect of the treatment was variable.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); however, little is known about its clinical characteristics and prognosis. Nine newly diagnosed HHT-PAH patients were prospectively recruited between October 2007 and January 2016 and were followed up every half-year. Eighteen idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients, matched with HHT-PAH patients on mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), were recruited. The clinical characteristics of HHT-PAH patients were described and the prognosis of these two cohorts were compared. Of HHT-PAH patients, 55.56% were WHO FC III. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed one- and three-year survival rates of HHT-PAH patients were 77.8% and 53.3% respectively, which were worse than matched IPAH patients (log rank: P = 0.047). HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid. HHT-PAH patients may have a worse prognosis than matched IPAH patients. Baseline total bilirubin may be a promising predictor for the long-term prognosis in HHT-PAH patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and multisystem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2). This robust patient cohort of brain AVMs in 39 patients with HHT advances the collective understanding of this disease's varied presentation, diagnostic workup, genetic underpinnings, and available treatment options.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations affecting various organs and systems. The liver is a commonly involved organ (74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), although symptomatic liver disease is quite infrequent. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations relate most commonly to the predominant type of vascular shunting present (arteriovenous, arterioportal, or portovenous). Clinically, liver disease can manifest as a high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, or biliary disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up of liver involvement, with ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography being useful in this context. We present a case of congestive cirrhosis with florid liver findings in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Imaging findings that clinched the diagnosis are reviewed.

"	"Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is an important risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. Current treatments for bAVM are all associated with considerable risks. There is no safe method to prevent bAVM hemorrhage. Thalidomide reduces nose bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an inherited disorder characterized by vascular malformations. In this study, we tested whether thalidomide and its less toxic analog, lenalidomide, reduce bAVM hemorrhage using a mouse model. bAVMs were induced through induction of brain focal activin-like kinase 1 (Alk1, an AVM causative gene) gene deletion and angiogenesis in adult Alk1-floxed mice. Thalidomide was injected intraperitoneally twice per week for 6 weeks, starting either 2 or 8 weeks after AVM induction. Lenalidomide was injected intraperitoneally daily starting 8 weeks after AVM induction for 6 weeks. Brain samples were collected at the end of the treatments for morphology, mRNA, and protein analyses. The influence of Alk1 downregulation on PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor B) expression was also studied on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells. The effect of PDGFB in mural cell recruitment in bAVM was explored by injection of a PDGFB overexpressing lentiviral vector to the mouse brain. Thalidomide or lenalidomide treatment reduced the number of dysplastic vessels and hemorrhage and increased mural cell (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) coverage in the bAVM lesion. Thalidomide reduced the burden of CD68+ cells and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the bAVM lesions. PDGFB expression was reduced in ALK1-knockdown human brain microvascular endothelial cells and in mouse bAVM lesion. Thalidomide increased Pdgfb expression in bAVM lesion. Overexpression of PDGFB mimicked the effect of thalidomide. Thalidomide and lenalidomide improve mural cell coverage of bAVM vessels and reduce bAVM hemorrhage, which is likely through upregulation of Pdgfb expression.

Genetic testing for a pathogenic mutation was considered the gold standard against which the clinical Curaçao criteria were compared. Patients were divided into 4 age categories: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-21-years. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each age group, and for the overall population. Overall the Curaçao criteria had a sensitivity of 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 91%-100%). Sensitivity was lowest in the 0- to 5-year group, and increased with advancing age.

This study evaluated the use of the Curaçao criteria for the diagnosis of HHT in the pediatric population with a family history of HHT. In those between the age of 0 and 21 years who meet 1 criterion (unlikely HHT) or 2 criteria (possible HHT), genetic testing is preferred for diagnosis.

Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton, sight organ, skin, lungs, heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage, especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels.Aim: To evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias.Study design: Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias, including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome (I group), 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (II group), and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) (III group) of the age from 18 to 36. The study included retrospective analysis (for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery, especially the risk of hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vessel growth that results in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia. We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea. Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.

Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE. In conclusion, we observed an improvement in Hgb and/or epistaxis in all treated patients. This occurred at a dose much lower than typically used for oncologic indications, with no serious AE. Further studies of pazopanib efficacy are warranted.

30272025	"Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required for RAD51-mediated maintenance of genome integrity in vascular endothelial cells
"	"The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with HHT can develop vascular dysplasias called telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.

30549294	"Recurrence of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia After Liver Transplantation: Clinical Implications and Physiopathological Insights
"	"Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. We provide a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT, with a focus on the risk of recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010, with a survival of more than 1 year. Protocol clinical, radiological, and histological examinations were performed at regular intervals. Fourteen patients were included (13 women and one man). Median age at LT was 52.5 years (range: 33.1-66.7). In eight patients (seven female), disease recurrence was diagnosed by abnormal radiological features, suggestive of microcirculatory disturbances. Typical vascular lesions, including telangiectasia, were demonstrated by liver biopsy in five of these patients. The median interval between LT and diagnosis of recurrence was 127 months (range: 74-184). The risk of recurrence increased over time; estimated cumulative risk was 47.9% at 15 years. Liver tissue analysis found the coexistence of an angiogenic process combined with endothelial microchimerism, as shown by the presence of vascular lining cells of recipient origin. Conclusion: The present data show that disease recurrence occurs, usually after a long delay, in a significant number of patients treated by LT for liver complications of HHT. This strongly supports the necessity of a lifelong follow-up and suggests that therapeutic strategy needs discussion and evaluation, especially of the role of potential adjuvant treatments to LT, such as antiangiogenic medications, when recurrent disease appears.

"	"Introduction: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) mainly affecting the lungs and the liver. In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.

30685840	"The Stratified Population Screening of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic vascular disease with a wordwide prevalence of 1:5000-1:10000. We introduce our algorithm for the stratified population screening of HHT. Probands are selected from the consecutive hospital database review for HHT (I7800) and recurrent epistaxis (R0400) and the review of patient records referred by family practicioners. A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.

30744395	"Angiopoietin-2 Inhibition Rescues Arteriovenous Malformation in a Smad4 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Mouse Model
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in 4 transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway members, including the central transcriptional mediator of the TGFβ pathway, Smad4. Loss of Smad4 causes the formation of inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can hemorrhage leading to stroke, aneurysm, or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and the TGFβ downstream effectors responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated AVM formation are currently unknown. To identify potential biological targets of the TGFβ pathway involved in AVM formation, we performed RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments on BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9)-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and isolated ECs from a Smad4-inducible, EC-specific knockout ( Smad4-iECKO) mouse model that develops retinal AVMs. These sequencing studies identified the angiopoietin-Tek signaling pathway as a downstream target of SMAD4. We used monoclonal blocking antibodies to target a specific component in this pathway and assess its effects on AVM development. Sequencing studies uncovered 212 potential biological targets involved in AVM formation, including the EC surface receptor, TEK (TEK receptor tyrosine kinase) and its antagonistic ligand, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2). In Smad4-iECKO mice, Angpt2 expression is robustly increased, whereas Tek levels are decreased, resulting in an overall reduction in angiopoietin-Tek signaling. We provide evidence that SMAD4 directly represses Angpt2 transcription in ECs. Inhibition of ANGPT2 function in Smad4-deficient mice, either before or after AVMs form, prevents and alleviates AVM formation and normalizes vessel diameters. These rescue effects are attributed to a reversion in EC morphological changes, such as cell size and shape that are altered in the absence of Smad4. Our studies provide a novel mechanism whereby the loss of Smad4 causes increased Angpt2 transcription in ECs leading to AVM formation, increased blood vessel calibers, and changes in EC morphology in the retina. Blockade of ANGPT2 function in an in vivo Smad4 model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia alleviated these vascular phenotypes, further implicating ANGPT2 as an important TGFβ downstream mediator of AVM formation. Therefore, alternative approaches that target ANGPT2 function may have therapeutic value for the alleviation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms, such as AVMs.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.

Analysis included 88 untreated PAVMs from 21 patients (6 male;15 female; mean age at presentation 47 y; range, 12-68 y). Two CT studies with the longest interval between were evaluated (mean 8.4 y; median 8.8 y; range, 3.1-14.1 y). Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up. Model-based mean analysis showed no statistically significant change in dimension of any variable between earliest and follow-up imaging. Secondary analysis including age also found no statistically significant difference (feeding diameter, P = .09; AP sac dimension, P = .9; ML sac dimension, P = .1). Analysis including time between measurements found no significant relationship between change in variables and time (feeding artery diameter, P = .4; AP sac dimension, P = .3; ML sac dimension, P = .06).

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

The aim of this study was to analyze HHT-associated gene variant spectrum in Chinese HHT patients and to assess whether genetic testing could contribute to the early diagnosis. Thirty one HHT families including 62 individuals were recruited. Variants in the coding regions of four genes involved in HHT were amplified and analyzed using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twenty unique variants, including 8 novel variants were found in 24 of the 31 (77.4%) kindred. Diagnosis is confirmed for 7 possible individuals from 6 kindred. Thirteen ACVRL1 variants were detected from 17 isolated HHT families. Variants in ACVRL1 from 8/17 (47.1%) families were located in exon8. Seven ENG variants were found in 7 unrelated families throughout the coding region. We conclude that ACVRL1 gene variant is 2.4 times more prevalent than that in ENG in Chinese individuals with HHT, and exon8 of the ACVRL1 gene may be a hotspot region. Genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis for HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea. We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: (""hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia"" AND ""Korea"") OR (""Osler-Weber-Rendu"" AND ""Korea""). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea. We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations. The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.

"	"Endoglin is a 180-kDa glycoprotein receptor primarily expressed by the vascular endothelium and involved in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene (ENG) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, a vascular disease that presents with nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. A circulating form of endoglin (alias soluble endoglin, sEng), proteolytically released from the membrane-bound protein, has been observed in several inflammation-related pathological conditions and appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cancer development through unknown mechanisms. Membrane-bound endoglin is an auxiliary component of the TGF-β receptor complex and the extracellular region of endoglin has been shown to interact with types I and II TGF-β receptors, as well as with BMP9 and BMP10 ligands, both members of the TGF-β family. To search for novel protein interactors, we screened a microarray containing over 9000 unique human proteins using recombinant sEng as bait. We find that sEng binds with high affinity, at least, to 22 new proteins. Among these, we validated the interaction of endoglin with galectin-3, a secreted member of the lectin family with capacity to bind membrane glycoproteins, and with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Using human endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that endoglin co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with galectin-3 or TRIM21. These results open new research avenues on endoglin function and regulation.

31615556	"Prospective pilot study of Floseal® for the treatment of anterior epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
"	"Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting more than 98% of adults with HHT, with significant impact on quality of life. Floseal® has been shown to be effective for the management of anterior epistaxis, but has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in this population. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Floseal® for managing acute anterior epistaxis in patients with HHT. A pilot prospective clinical trial was conducted at two tertiary referral centres, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada and The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. All patients with HHT presenting with acute anterior epistaxis to the two study centres, who enrolled in the study, received Floseal® treatment. The primary outcome measures were achievement of hemostasis and changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) between baseline and one-month follow up. Secondary outcome measure included clinical assessment of the nasal cavity. Seven patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent treatment of anterior epistaxis with Floseal® and achieved control of epistaxis within 15-min post-application. Application of Floseal® was well tolerated, with patients reporting a pain score of 3 ± 3.13 out of 10. There was no statistically significant difference noted in ESS scores pre-treatment and one-month follow up, 6.27 ± 2.42 vs. 4.50 ± 2.44, p = 0.179. There was a significant improvement clinically on exam of the nasal cavity between baseline and at one-month follow up, indicated by a decrease in the clinical assessment score, 17.29 ± 7.70 vs. 9.57 ± 7.81 (p = 0.0088). Patients with HHT presenting with acute epistaxis were able to achieve hemostasis with one application of Floseal®, with the procedure being very well tolerated with minimal pain. Although there was no significant change in ESS scores, clinical assessment of the nasal cavity revealed significant improvement at one-month follow up post treatment with Floseal®. This multi-centered prospective clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02638012 ). Registered on December 22, 2015.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

"	"To compare 1 year post-embolization reperfusion rates in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) treated with the 0.035″ Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System coils (IDC) (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) versus 0.035″ Nester coils (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, Indiana). A randomized controlled trial was performed randomizing individual PAVMs to treatment with IDC versus Nester coils at the largest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center in Canada. The primary outcome was CT evidence of reperfusion at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural complications, fluoroscopy time and contrast volume. Our study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and subsequent expiration of funding. A total of 46 PAVMs in 25 patients (64% female) were included in our study; 26 randomized to Nester coils and 20 randomized to IDC. One patient was lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 421.2 ± 215.7 days, no significant difference in PAVM reperfusion was detected between Nester coils and IDC (0% vs. 5.6%, p > 0.05). No major periprocedural complications were noted in either group. Fluoroscopy time (Nester: 15.0 ± 11.8 min vs. IDC 16.0 ± 5.4 min, p > 0.05) and contrast volume (Nester: 80.3 ± 36.5 ml vs. IDC 87.3 ± 51.7 ml, p > 0.05) utilized did not differ between groups. No significant difference was detected in PAVM reperfusion rates, periprocedural complication rates, contrast volume utilization or fluoroscopy time following embolization with IDC and Nester coils.

32078368	"Impaired SMAD1/5 Mechanotransduction and Cx37 (Connexin37) Expression Enable Pathological Vessel Enlargement and Shunting
"	"Impaired ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1)/Endoglin/BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) signaling predisposes to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activation of SMAD1/5 signaling can be enhanced by shear stress. In the genetic disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is characterized by arteriovenous malformations, the affected receptors are those involved in the activation of mechanosensitive SMAD1/5 signaling. To elucidate how genetic and mechanical signals interact in AVM development, we sought to identify targets differentially regulated by BMP9 and shear stress. Approach and Results: We identify Cx37 (Connexin37) as a differentially regulated target of ligand-induced and mechanotransduced SMAD1/5 signaling. We show that stimulation of endothelial cells with BMP9 upregulated Cx37, whereas shear stress inhibited this expression. This signaling was SMAD1/5-dependent, and in the absence of SMAD1/5, there was an inversion of the expression pattern. Ablated SMAD1/5 signaling alone caused AVM-like vascular malformations directly connecting the dorsal aorta to the inlet of the heart. In yolk sacs of mouse embryos with an endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5, addition of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), which downregulates Cx37, induced development of these direct connections bypassing the yolk sac capillary bed. In wild-type embryos undergoing vascular remodeling, Cx37 was globally expressed by endothelial cells but was absent in regions of enlarging vessels. TNFα and endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5 caused ectopic regions lacking Cx37 expression, which correlated to areas of vascular malformations. Mechanistically, loss of Cx37 impairs correct directional migration under flow conditions. Our data demonstrate that Cx37 expression is differentially regulated by shear stress and SMAD1/5 signaling, and that reduced Cx37 expression is permissive for capillary enlargement into shunts.

"	"Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (OWRD), called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an uncommon genetic illness with the dominant autosomal transmission. It cannot be easily or quickly diagnosed because of both its infrequency and its various associated symptoms. As far as its symptoms are concerned, the patient experiences recurring epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations that can lead to severe undesirable symptoms. In our case, we report a 32-year-old female that was diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia and whose paraclinical examinations showed that she suffers from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease. Management of OWRD includes systematic diagnosis of visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in regular intervals, measures to prevent complications, and symptomatic treatment.

"	"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often involves the liver, and belongs to abnormal blood vessel disease. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is not clear, but congenital vascular dysplasia is considered to be one of the causes. Liver cirrhosis due to hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia concomitant with BCS has not been reported. Here, we report a case of cirrhosis with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHHT) and BCS. A 58-year-old woman with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia showed decompensated liver cirrhosis, and abdominal imaging revealed Budd-Chiari syndrome. Disease has progressed considerably during 2.5 years after hospital discharge despite subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). One hypothesis that might explain the coexistence of hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome in this patient is ischemia and thrombosis of hepatic veins. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between HHHT and BCS. Our observations already challenged the TIPS therapeutic strategy in BCS secondary to HHHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Disease-causing variants in endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) genes are detected in more than 90% of cases submitted to molecular diagnosis. We used data from the RiHHTa (Computerized Registry of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) registry to describe genetic variants and to assess their genotype-phenotype correlation among HHT patients in Spain. By May 2019, 215 patients were included in the RiHHTa registry with a mean age of 52.5 ± 16.5 years and 136 (63.3%) were women. Definitive HHT diagnosis defined by the Curaçao criteria were met by 172 (80%) patients. Among 113 patients with genetic test, 77 (68.1%) showed a genetic variant in ACVRL1 and 36 (31.8%) in ENG gene. The identified genetic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG genes and their clinical significance are provided. ACVRL1 mutations were more frequently nonsense (50%) while ENG mutations were more frequently, frameshift (39.1%). ENG patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36.9 vs 45.7 years) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (71.4% vs 24.4%) and cerebral AVMs (17.6% vs 2%) more often than patients with ACVRL1 variants. Patients with ACVRL1 variants had a higher cardiac index (2.62 vs 3.46), higher levels of hepatic functional blood tests, and anemia (28.5% vs 56.7%) more often than ENG patients. ACVRL1 variants are more frequent than ENG in Spain. ACVRL1 patients developed symptomatic liver disease and anemia more often than ENG patients. Compared to ACVRL1, those with ENG variants are younger at diagnosis and show pulmonary and cerebral AVMs more frequently.

"	"Objective: To explore the value of right heart contrast echocardiography in etiological diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 patients who underwent transthoracic contrast echocardiography in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from May 2015 to July 2018, all of whom were diagnosed as PH by right heart catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups according to contrast echocardiography: the intra-cardiac shunt group (<4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); Intrapulmonary shunt group (>4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); non-shunt group. The etiology, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PO(2)), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central nervous system complications were also compared among the three groups. Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.

32538908	"Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization in Zebrafish Embryos and Tube Formation Assay in iPSC-ECs to Study the Role of Endoglin in Vascular Development
"	"Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.

One week before her surgery, her mother at 32 weeks of gestation underwent emergency surgery for hemothorax caused by pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture.

The indications for treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in young patients remain controversial because the risk of complications concerning pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is lower in young patients than in adult patients. We recommend that aggressive treatment should be performed for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis with a family history of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture even if the patient is asymptomatic and young, because such patients may have a high risk of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture.

32573726	"Mutational and phenotypic characterization of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Care delivery for HHT patients is impeded by the need for laborious, repeated phenotyping and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between causal DNA variants in ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4 and GDF2, and clinical manifestations. To address this, we analyzed DNA samples from 183 previously uncharacterized, unrelated HHT and suspected HHT cases using the ThromboGenomics high-throughput sequencing platform. We identified 127 rare variants across 168 heterozygous genotypes. Applying modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines, 106 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 21 as nonpathogenic (variant of uncertain significance/benign). Unlike the protein products of ACVRL1 and SMAD4, the extracellular ENG amino acids are not strongly conserved. Our inferences of the functional consequences of causal variants in ENG were therefore informed by the crystal structure of endoglin. We then compared the accuracy of predictions of the causal gene blinded to the genetic data using 2 approaches: subjective clinical predictions and statistical predictions based on 8 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Both approaches had some predictive power, but they were insufficiently accurate to be used clinically, without genetic testing. The distributions of red cell indices differed by causal gene but not sufficiently for clinical use in isolation from genetic data. We conclude that parallel sequencing of the 4 known HHT genes, multidisciplinary team review of variant calls in the context of detailed clinical information, and statistical and structural modeling improve the prognostication and treatment of HHT.

All neuroimaging was reviewed to assess for number and types of cerebrovascular malformations and for intracerebral hemorrhage and arterial ischemic stroke. Clinical charts were reviewed for clinical manifestations, genetic mutation, and clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhages and arterial ischemic strokes. Among 54 children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a median age of 3.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 7.9 years) at diagnosis, neuroimaging was performed in 52 (96.3%) at a median age of 5.2 years (interquartile range 1.8 to 9 years). Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The three children with intracerebral hemorrhage presented at young ages (4.3 to 7.7 years). More than a quarter of children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who were imaged had cerebrovascular malformations, and overt stroke occurred in more than 10%. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients at young ages, and new cerebral arteriovenous malformations may develop over time. Early screening with neuroimaging including neurovascular imaging as well as repeat neuroimaging may be warranted in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

It is characterized by presence of recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. It is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant transmission inducing an endothelial cells hyper-proliferation. A 68-year-old women with Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome was referred for management of general impairment with confusional syndrome and hyperthermia. Various examinations have allowed us to conclude at diagnosis of brain abscess with ventriculitis probably favored by right-left shunt secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Evolution was favorable after antibiotic treatment and endovascular embolization. In case of brain abscess without obvious promoting factor, don't forget to looking for a right-left shunt providing septic or aseptic emboli. Furthermore, diagnosis of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome should be considered presence of telangiectasias and/or epistaxis.

ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 are the most common gene mutations reported in HPAH with HHT. We report a 11-year-old boy with a definite diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and suspected HHT with recurrent epistaxis. The results of gene detection showed that there was a nosense mutation in BMPR2. The results of gene detection of ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 were normal.

About a month later, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding and sudden convulsions. The patient's vital signs were stable after symptomatic treatment. After discharging from hospital, the patients continued to take ambrisentan. No epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding was found in one month of follow-up, but the symptoms of chest tightness were not significantly alleviated. BMPR2 with a nonsense mutation is more likely to cause HPAH with HHT and are more likely to be life-threatening.

32762495	"Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.

Due to recurrent bleeding from epistaxis or the gastrointestinal tract, patients with HHT and atrial fibrillation are at high risk of bleeding if anticoagulated for stroke prevention. In this report, we present a case of a 74-year-old woman with a history of HHT and atrial fibrillation who developed a large left atrial thrombus that initially was thought to represent an atrial myxoma. The diagnosis was confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.

"	"To test if the impairment of mononuclear cell (MNC) migration in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is due to the reduction of the endoglin (ENG) receptor on the cell surface and oxidative stress. MNCs of HHT patients and normal controls were subjected to migration assay. Fractions of MNCs were pre-incubated with antibodies specific to HHT causative genes ENG [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1)] or activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2)], AMD3100 or Diprotin-A to block ENG, ALK1 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) or CD26 (increased in HHT1 MNCs) before migration assay. The MNCs were allowed to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 18 h. The expression of CXCR4, CD26, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) in MNCs and nitric oxide levels in the plasma were analyzed. Compared to the controls, fewer HHT1 MNCs and similar number of HHT2 MNCs migrated toward SDF-1α. Diprotin-A pre-treatment improved HHT1 MNC-migration, but had no effect on normal and HHT2 MNCs. Pre-incubation with an anti-ENG antibody reduced the migration of normal MNCs. Diprotin-A did not improve the migration of ENG antibody pre-treated MNCs. Anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on MNC-migration. AMD3100 treatment reduced normal and HHT MNC-migration. ENG mRNA level was reduced in HHT1 and HHT2 MNCs. ALK1 mRNA was reduced in HHT2 MNCs only. CD26 expression was higher in HHT1 MNCs. Pre-treatment of MNCs with anti-ENG or anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on CD26 and CXCR4 expression. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, SOD1, was reduced in HHT1 MNCs, which was accompanied with an increase of ROS in HHT MNCs and nitric oxide in HHT1 plasma. Reduction of ENG receptor on MNC surface reduced monocyte migration toward SDF-1α independent of CD26 expression. Increased oxidative stress could alter HHT MNC migration behavior.

To develop and validate an epistaxis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure for HHT. This survey study focused on the development and validation of the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis (NOSE) in HTT (NOSE HHT) outcome measure with data prospectively collected from December 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. A total of 401 patients were recruited from within the Cure Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia online patient advocacy social media network, the Washington University HHT Center of Excellence, and a randomized clinical trial investigating an intranasal timolol gel for HHT-associated epistaxis. Face and content validity, factor analysis, internal consistency as measured through Cronbach α, construct validity, responsiveness to change, and minimal clinically important difference. The NOSE HHT was developed and validated with a possible score ranging discretely from 0 to 4 for each of the 29 items and a total score ranging continuously from 0 to 4 after dividing by the total number of items answered. A total of 401 participants completed the NOSE HHT. Factor analysis identified 3 factors that matched the a priori specified subgroups of particular aspects of life affected by HHT-associated epistaxis: physical problems (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.59 [0.83]), functional limitations (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.28 [0.84]), and emotional consequences (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.95 [1.02]). The instrument had high internal consistency with an overall Cronbach α of 0.960. Convergent validity determined the total NOSE HHT score to be a strong predictor of disease severity; total NOSE HHT score can be split up into the following epistaxis severity categories: mild (0-1), moderate (1.01-2), and severe (>2). The instrument was found to be sensitive to change, and the minimal clinically important difference for the total NOSE HHT score was 0.46. Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy may be underdiagnosed as it is often mistaken for disorders that are morphologically very similar, including generalized essential telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis. The diagnosis of CCV is made histologically and findings feature dilated superficial dermal vessels with thickened walls containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive eosinophilic hyaline material. Effective treatment options for CCV have yet to be established and given its benign disease course, treatment may not be necessary.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Untreated AVMs, especially in the lungs-pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)-can result in morbidity with a decreased life expectancy. We have investigated whether HHT patients, systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed, have a similar survival as persons without HHT. We included all individuals screened for HHT between 2004 and 2016 with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis (HHT group) or excluded diagnosis (non-HHT control group). The social security number was used to confirm status as dead or alive in December 2019. We included 717 HHT patients and 471 controls. There was no difference in survival between the HHT and the non-HHT control group. The HHT group had a life expectancy of 75.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.3-78.6), comparable to the control group (79.3 years, 95% CI 74.8-84.0, Mantel-Cox test: p = 0.29).

By inhibiting VEGF, itraconazole has shown potential in clinical trials as anti-cancer treatment. In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients, VEGF levels are elevated and inhibition of VEGF can decrease bleeding. Itraconazole could potentially serve as anti-angiogenic therapy for HHT-related bleeding. We report a proof of concept study with HHT patients and severe epistaxis. Patients were treated with daily 200 mg orally administered itraconazole for sixteen weeks. Twenty-one HHT patients, 8 females (38%), 13 males (62%), median age of 59 years (interquartile range (IQR) 55-69) were enrolled. Of these patients, 13 (62%) were diagnosed with HHT type 1, seven (33%) with HHT type 2 and in one patient (5%), no pathognomonic HHT mutation was found. Four patients (19%) prematurely terminated the study (3 due to mild or moderate side-effects) resulting in 17 patients included in the analyses. The median epistaxis severity score significantly decreased during treatment from 6.0 (IQR 5.1-7.2) to 3.8 (IQR 3.1-5.2) (p = 0.006). The monthly epistaxis frequency decreased from 56 to 38 epistaxis episodes (p = 0.004) and the monthly duration from 407 to 278 minutes (p = 0.005). Hemoglobin levels did not significantly change.

33242965	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation managed by VATS lobectomy
"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is formed by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins that bypass the pulmonary capillaries and transport deoxygenated blood through pulmonary veins to the left heart. This causes insufficient oxygenation of blood in the lungs. This condition remains symptomless for a long period of time. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, nosebleeds, increased fatigue and a gradual development of cyanosis. Paradoxical embolism in the brain is a serious complication; it can present with a stroke or a brain abscess. Treatment of the disease consists of embolization of the pathological vascular connections, surgical resection of the affected pulmonary parenchyma and management of concomitant manifestations of the disease. PAVM in most common cases arises as a result of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder referred to as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Case report: In our communication, we document the diagnostic and therapeutic management in a young patient diagnosed with PAVM after falling off his bicycle. Based on comprehensive assessments, AV malformations with a 40% shunt of the pulmonary circulation were detected. An angiographic procedure was not an appropriate option considering the type and extent of the condition. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic resection of the affected pulmonary lobe was indicated. Conclusion: PAVM is a rare finding. PAVM should be ruled out in all patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) signs in the oral cavity. Contrast sonography of the heart and contract CT of the chest are the methods of choice for the diagnosis. Conservative or pharmacological treat-ment fails to improve the patients status.  The condition is usually managed by embolization. Cases where PAVM is rather extensive or diffuse, where endovascular management would be inappropriate, can be well managed using endoscopic resection adequate to the extent of the condition.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.

"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

33677851	"Genetic variants and clinical phenotypes in Korean patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) and Endoglin (ENG) are the principal genes whose mutations cause HHT. A multicenter study to investigate the correlation between genetic variations and clinical outcomes in Korean HHT patients has been lacking. Seventy-two members from 40 families suspected of HHT based on symptoms were genetically screened for pathogenic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG. Patients with genetically diagnosed HHT were also evaluated. In the HHT genetic screening, 42 patients from 24 of the 40 families had genetic variants that met the pathogenic criteria (pathogenic very strong, pathogenic strong, pathogenic moderate, or pathogenic supporting) based on ACMG Standards and Guidelines in either ENG or ACVRL1; 26 from 12 families (50%) in ENG, and 16 from 12 families (50%) in ACVRL1. The diagnostic screening of 42 genetically positive HHT patients based on the Curaçao criteria revealed that 24 patients (57%) were in the definite group, 17 patients (41%) were in the probable group, and 1 patient (2%) was in the unlikely group. Epistaxis was the most common clinical presentation (38/42, 90%), followed by visceral AVMs (24/42, 57%), and telangiectasia (21/42, 50%). Five patients (12%) did not have a family history of HHT clinical symptoms. Among patients having ACVRL1 or ENG genetic variants, only about half of them could be clinically diagnosed as definite HHT, suggesting that genetic screening is important to confirm the diagnosis.

Laboratory examinations showed an increase in hemoglobin (162 g/L) and a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (61.5 mm Hg). Lung CT showed irregular slightly high-density nodules in the middle lobe of the right lung, and contrast-enhanced CT scan showed obvious enhancement with thick vascular shadow locally. An investigation of medical history revealed that the girl's mother had a history of epistaxis and resection of pulmonary mass and the girl presented with tongue telangiectasia. The girl was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. she was given interventional embolization therapy. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation reached 98% without oxygen inhalation on the day after surgery. Pulmonary angiography at 3 months after surgery showed the recurrence of pulmonary vascular malformation, and embolization of pulmonary arterial fistula was not performed since the guide wire could not enter the branch artery. There was still a need for long-term follow-up.

20042635	"ALK5 phosphorylation of the endoglin cytoplasmic domain regulates Smad1/5/8 signaling and endothelial cell migration
"	"Endoglin, an endothelial cell-specific transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor, has an essential role in angiogenesis. **Endoglin-null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype due to defects in angiogenesis and mutations in endoglin result in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I**. Increased endoglin expression in the proliferating endothelium of tumors has been correlated with metastasis, tumor grade and decreased survival. Although endoglin is thought to regulate TGF-beta superfamily signaling in endothelial cells through regulating the balance between two TGF-beta-responsive pathways, the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad2/3 pathway and the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1/5/8 pathway, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis has not been defined. Here, **we investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and its phosphorylation by ALK5 in regulating endoglin function in endothelial cells.** We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin is basally phosphorylated by ALK5, primarily on serines 646 and 649, in endothelial cells. Functionally, the loss of phosphorylation at serine 646 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to TGF-beta and endothelial cell migration, whereas loss of phosphorylation at both serines 646 and 649 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to bone morphogenetic protein-9. Taken together, these results support **endoglin phosphorylation by ALK5 as an important mechanism for regulating TGF-beta superfamily signaling and migration in endothelial cells.**

"	"Activin A receptor type II-like kinase-1 (ACVRL1, also known as ALK1) mutation is a cause of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and/or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). To describe the characteristics of patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation. We reviewed clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics of 32 patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation, corresponding to 9 patients from the French PAH Network and 23 from literature analysis. These cases were compared with 370 patients from the French PAH Network (93 with a bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 [BMPR2] mutation and 277 considered as idiopathic cases without identified mutation). Distribution of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene in patients with PAH was compared with the HHT Mutation Database. At diagnosis, ACVRL1 mutation carriers were significantly younger (21.8 +/- 16.7 yr) than BMPR2 mutation carriers and noncarriers (35.7 +/- 14.9 and 47.6 +/- 16.3 yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). In seven of the nine patients from the French PAH Network, PAH diagnosis preceded manifestations of HHT. ACVRL1 mutation carriers had better hemodynamic status at diagnosis, but none responded to acute vasodilator challenge and they had shorter survival when compared with other patients with PAH despite similar use of specific therapies. ACVRL1 mutations in exon 10 were more frequently observed in patients with PAH, as compared with what was observed in the HHT Mutation Database (33.3 vs. 5%; P < 0.0001). ACVRL1 mutation carriers were characterized by a younger age at PAH diagnosis. Despite less severe initial hemodynamics and similar management, these patients had worse prognosis compared with other patients with PAH, suggesting more rapid disease progression.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by telangiectases and internal arteriovenous malformations caused by mutations in certain elements of the TGF-beta receptor complex. In the case of HHT1 mutations in the endoglin gene are responsible, whereas mutations in the ALK1 gene (an activin receptor-like kinase 1), lead to HHT2. Another two loci found at chromosome 5 and chromosome 7, whose target genes remain unidentified, lead to types 3 and 4 of the disease, respectively. Mutations in the MADH4/SMAD4 gene, another member of the TGF-beta signalling pathway, lead to a combined syndrome of familial juvenile polyposis associated with HHT. In an attempt to identify some soluble components differentially expressed in the plasma of HHT patients, angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin concentrations were analyzed with standard quantitative sandwich ELISA. **Angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin levels are reduced in plasma of HHT patients compared to control individuals, and a diagnostic algorithm for HHT based on these protein levels is proposed.** Down-regulated protein levels of angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin in plasma represent novel HHT biomarkers that could be useful in the biochemical diagnosis of HHT facilitating the rapid identification of potential HHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related epistaxis leads to alterations in social functioning and quality of life. Although more than 95% experience epistaxis, there is considerable variability of severity. Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score. Prospective, survey-based study. HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From** this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. **Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported e**pistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female.

"	"Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, w**e collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations**. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. **Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT**. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.

We studied the prevalence and size of pulmonary RLS in HHT type 1, HHT type 2, and HHT-negative controls, and its positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for PAVMs that can be treated by embolotherapy. In 343 consecutive persons referred for possible HHT as first-degree family members of index patients a TTCE and chest CT scan were performed. **All persons were offered genetic analysis**. An **HHT-causing mutation was confirmed in 92** (mean age 41 ± 15 y; 59% female) HHT1 relatives and in 97 (mean age 47 ± 14 y; 52% female) HHT2 relatives. **TTCE showed a pulmonary RLS in 78 (85%) HHT1- and 34 (35%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively** (P < .0001). In HHT1 relatives, 29 of 53 (55%) PAVMs and in HHT2 relatives three of 17 (18%) PAVMS were treated, resulting in a PPV of TTCE for treatable PAVMs of 36.3% and 8.3%, respectively.

A large shunt predicted treatable PAVMs in 55.8% of HHT1 relatives and 37.5% of HHT2 relatives. TTCE was positive in four (6%) of 63 persons without HHT. **A pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in HHT1- compared with HHT2-related mutation carriers**. **Shunt grading is helpful to predict treatable PAVMs, particularly in the HHT2 group.

"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often present with recurrent anemia because of epistaxis or GI bleeding in relation to telangiectases mostly located in the stomach or small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood. To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Prospective, descriptive study. Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007. This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy investigation. Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences. Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7%) and 26 (86.7%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7% of patients. Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation. This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.

"	"Hepatic involvement occurs in up to 74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and is characterized by a spectrum of arteriovenous malformations. Three different types of intrahepatic shunting may be present: hepatic artery to hepatic veins, hepatic artery to portal vein, and portal vein to hepatic vein. Hepatic involvement in HHT may lead to biliary ischemia, portal hypertension, or high-output cardiac failure (HOCF). **Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as the only definitive curative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hepatic involvement due to HHT after OLT with respect to mortality, cardiac and hepatic status, epistaxis, and quality of life**. Patients with HHT and severe hepatic vascular malformations who underwent OLT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit (LLTU) from 1993 to 2007 were followed at the LLTU and the French Reference Center for HHT. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. There were 13 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria of the study (12 women and 1 man). The mean age at the time of OLT was 51.8 years (range = 33-65 years). Indications for OLT were cardiac failure (n = 9), biliary necrosis (n = 2), both cardiac failure and biliary necrosis (n = 1), and hemobilia (n = 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 109 months (range = 1-200 months). Twelve patients (92.3%) are still alive. For the 9 patients with HOCF, the mean cardiac index decreased from 5.4 L/minute/m(2) before OLT to 3.0 L/minute/m(2) after OLT. No severe hepatic complications were observed after OLT. Nine of the surviving patients (75%) experienced dramatic improvements in epistaxis and quality of life, including an ability to undertake more physical activity. In conclusion, OLT is an important therapeutic option for patients with HHT who have severe hepatic involvement. In the reported cohort, the mortality after OLT for this indication was low.

20224041	"Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin
"	"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation.** Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM.** In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily** accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina**. Endoglin-**deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs.** Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.

As alternative treatment modalities repeatedly failed and the patient became almost permanently dependent on nasal dressing, we performed a highly conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the nasal cavity; a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy single fractions was applied. The therapy was very well tolerated, no acute toxicities occurred. Two weeks after the last radiation dose had been applied, the nasal dressing could be removed without problems. Endoscopical control revealed an almost avascular white mucosa without any trace of bleeding spots; previously existing hemangiomas and crusts had disappeared. After a 1-year-follow up, the patient had no significant recurrent epistaxis.

"	"T**o evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of transcatheter embolotherapy for treating sporadic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) that were not associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia**. Between January 2001 and June 2008, thirty-five sporadic PAVMs were detected in 23 patients. The clinical follow up consisted of assessing the changes of the signs and symptoms of the PAVMs, and radiological evaluation with chest radiographs or chest CT scans. The lower lung regions (63%) and peripheral locations (86%) were the common locations of the PAVMs. Thirty-four PAVMs (97%) had simple architecture (one arterial feeder within a single pulmonary segment). Technical success was achieved in 33 PAVMs (94%); two cases of technical failure were due to catheterization failure (n = 1) and too large a feeding artery (17 mm) that disabled embolotherapy (n = 1). Coils and Amplatz vascular plugs were used in 30 and three PAVMs, respectively. Inadvertent placement of one coil (n = 1) and pulmonary infarction (n = 1) occurred, but no relevant symptoms developed. For the 13 patients with available data, the mean arterial O(2) saturation changed significantly from 92% to 98%. Complete or near-complete involution of the sac was observed in 30 of the 33 embolized PAVMs (91%). In these 33 embolized PAVMs, the mean sac diameter significantly decreased from 17.83 mm to 0.68 mm. Sporadic PAVMs are mostly the simple type with predominance in the lower lobe and peripheral locations. Transcatheter embolotherapy with coils or Amplatz vascular plugs is a safe and effective treatment for sporadic PAVMs and this provides excellent functional and radiological improvement.

A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of **headache** for 2 months before **acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever.** CT-scan and **MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion.** **A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved.** CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after **coil embolization.** He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A **second embolization** was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke.

After application of two antiplatelet drugs, the patient was scheduled for coronarography, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting. During her hospital stay, only a minor episode of epistaxis was observed. We conclude that anemization due to HTT may significantly accelerate the progress of ischemic heart disease, resulting in acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, coronarography preceded by routine application of two antiplatelet drugs seems not to increase the risk of hemorrhage in HHT patients complicated with myocardial infarction.

Patients were included if they had primary, nonhematologic lung tumors. Simple squamous papillomas subjected to endoscopic biopsy and not resected, and vascular lesions associated with multisystem lesions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, were excluded. Medical records and pathologic material for patients from 1918 to 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients were identified (23 boys, 17 girls) with a mean age of 9.6 years (range, 3 months to 19 years). Fourteen distinct** histopathologic tumor** types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. **Chemotherapy** was used in 23% (9) and **radiation** in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.

21310938	"Immunosuppressor FK506 increases endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression and modulates transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in endothelial cells
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Patients show severe epistaxis, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency. No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies. We report the efficacy of **tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression. **The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after hepatic failure due to a liver arteriovenous malformation. **The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection**. After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external telangiectases, epistaxes, and anemia disappeared. Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation.

"	"Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are at risk for multiple complications and require close follow-up. We investigated the reproducibility of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and exercise stress test (EST) for the evaluation of low oxygen saturation in patients with PAVMs. Twenty-two patients with PAVMs, most of whom had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), participated in a Human Investigations Committee-approved protocol. Patients ranged from 9 to 74 years of age (mean 28) and had a broad spectrum of anatomic subtypes of PAVMs, including focal and diffuse. Standard 6MWT and cycle ergometry EST were both performed twice with adequate rest between tests. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were measured at the beginning and end of each test. Distance walked and maximum resistance was also recorded. The intraclass correlation coefficients (r(i)) at the end of 6MWT were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.940; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.973; 95% CI 0.933-0.989), and distance (r(i) = 0.942; 95% CI 0.867-0.975). The r(i)s at the end of EST were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.865-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.993; 95% CI 0.982-0.997), and maximum resistance (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.864-0.975). 6MWT and EST were reproducible measures of exercise capacity and oxygen saturation and are potential adjunct tests in the follow-up assessment for patients with PAVMs.

"	"BACKROUNDS/PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Weber-Osler is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasia that may affect the nose, skin, lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well. Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Before and after treatment, the quality of life, as measured by the patient, was assessed and compared to normative data. In 30 patients, we measured the BT before laser treatment 1.5 and 6.5 months after treatment. The Short form 36 (SF-36), a validated health questionnaire, was completed before and 6.5 months after treatment. **Compared to preoperative value, BT was significantly reduced 1.5 and 6.5 months after laser treatment (p < 0.05) in both cases.** No significant difference in quality of life, before and after treatment, was found.

"	"Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) or embospheres in diameter of 500-700-µm were used as an embolic material. Embolization was technically successful in 11 (78.5%) patients. Immediate, complete control of bleeding was achieved in 12 (85%) patients. During long-term follow-up recurrent nasal bleeding occurred in six (43%) patients 6-24 months after treatment. There were no severe complications after embolization. Nine patients experienced mild facial pain which resolved within three days after the treatment.

Despite the young age, a lot of comorbidities were present: **severe dyslipidemia, ischemic right cerebellar lesion, degenerative periventricular lesions, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, uterine fibroma, fibrocystic mastitis, polyglobulia of uncertain etiology and Rendu-Osler disease**. The investigation which showed the nature of the pulmonary nodule was the CT scan with intravenous contrast, which demonstrated that the nodules were in fact arterial-venous malformations as part of the Rendu-Osler disease. This case offers the opportunity to discuss about etiopathogeny, morphopathology, criteria of diagnosis and treatment principles in Rendu-Osler disease.

22120563	"Surgical and endovascular treatment of pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations
"	"Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. **The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities.** We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. **Their charts were reviewed**. S**pinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis** (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia and severe, recurrent epistaxis is a common clinical phenotype associated with HHT. An intranasal treatment regime of diluted Avastin™ (Bevacizumab; recombinant humanized anti-vascular epithelial growth factor immunoglobin G1) using apulsatile nasal irrigator has proven efficacious in clinical practice. However, concerns regarding the stability of Avastin™ following dilution and prolonged storage in standard containers used for drug delivery, such as polyethylene bottles, have so far prevented a more widespread clinical use. Compatibility with the preservative benzalkonium chloride was also unknown. This study aimed at determining, whether dilution, prolonged refrigerated storage and the presence of the preservative benzalkonium chloride - as required for novel Avastin™ formulations - affected the biochemical and electrochemical properties of the drug. We performed a detailed biochemical and electrochemical analysis of Avastin™, including native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isoelectric focusing. We did not detect any evidence of degeneration or aggregation following dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage or from the presence of benzalkonium chloride. All biochemical and electrochemical properties of Avastin™ after dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage were undistinguishable from control. Our data provide important insight into the stability of Avastin™ and allow the consideration of novel Avastin™ formulations, including its use in a metered-dose nasal spray for the treatment of HHT and other applications.

"	"Pediatric pial arteriovenous fistulae (pAVF) are rare vascular lesions of the CNS, reported to have up to a 25% association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. **The presentation, treatment and syndromes associated with pAVF in children are reported here. **A pediatric database for pAVF was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%)**. Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation**. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh.** Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. **Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. **She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. **The patient was treated with **bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months.** Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.

"	"In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations frequently lead to complications. In a case of pleural effusion in a patient with known pulmonary arterio-venous malformations, the first diagnosis to consider is a hemothorax even though alternatives such as empyema are possible. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with bilateral arteriovenous malformations, who was admitted to the emergency department with subacute dyspnoea and left thoracic pain. The clinical examination suggested a hemothorax. Pulmonary angiography was performed and showed an arteriovenous malformation in the left lower lobe. Embolisation was undertaken and at the same time a chest tube was inserted. Pus was evacuated leading to the final diagnosis of pleural empyema. Progress was good despite an episode acute respiratory distress due to a pulmonary embolism. Pleural empyema is rarely described in the context of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. In the case of pleural effusion this diagnosis should be considered even though hemothorax is more common.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes. A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.

22385575	"A novel ENG mutation causing impaired co-translational processing of endoglin associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in mainly the endoglin gene (ENG) or activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) gene (ACVRL1). We investigated the molecular basis of HHT in a Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation in ENG (c.38T>A, p.Leu13Gln) located in the signal peptide's hydrophobic core, but not in ACVRL1. In experiments in COS-1 cells, the Leu13Gln (L13Q) mutant endoglin appeared to be expressed as a precursor form, probably due to impaired protein processing. Flow cytometry analyses of the COS-1 cells transiently expressing recombinant endoglins revealed that the wild-type endoglin was detected on the cell surface, but the L13Q mutant was not. We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.

22421041	"ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway
"	"Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. **Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway.** Blocking Alk1 signaling during** postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).** Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited disease that occurs in approximately one in 5000 to 8000 people. Clinical diagnosis of HHT is made when a person presents three of the following four criteria: family history, recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. **We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. **Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. **The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years. A genetic study revealed a mutation in exon 3 of ALK1 (c.199C > T; p.Arg67Trp) in the proband and his eldest son presenting epistaxis.

We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with decompensated right-sided heart failure secondary to newly diagnosed PAH. The clinical diagnosis of HHT was confirmed on the basis of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple typical mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. There was also a suggestive family history. The patient was discovered to have active and extensive stimulant abuse in addition to HHT. We concluded that there may be a temporal relationship between exposure to stimulants and development of PAH in a host with underlying gene mutation. This case highlights the paradigm of PAH development after environmental exposure in a genetically susceptible host.

In family II, there was a missense mutation of c.1271C > T on ACVRL1 in 2 patients, leading to the transfer of amino acids from Pro to Leu at 424(th) place. In family III, there was a deletion mutation of c.147delC on ACVRL1 so as to produce only the former 53 amino acids of ALK1 protein. Through an analysis of multi-species conservation, the mutations were conserved between multiple species. By querying the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, we confirmed that the mutation was not of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genetic screening of HHT patients may identify their virulence gene. And genetic screening of their offspring is helpful for the early diagnosis and prevention before disease onset.

23018639	"BMP9 regulates endoglin-dependent chemokine responses in endothelial cells.
"	"BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10**. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9**. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicat**e BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation**.

23090737	"SMAD4 haploinsufficiency associates with augmented colonic inflammation in select humans and mice
"	"SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

For transfusion-dependent patients with severe epistaxis we have been performing the Young's procedure or surgical closure of the nostrils. The objective of this study was to report treatment of severe epistaxis related to HHT with the Young's procedure and assess patient outcome. Patients with severe iron or blood transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a Young's procedure in three otolaryngology HHT centers were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for postoperative epistaxis and subjective outcome. Forty-three patients underwent a Young's procedure for severe epistaxis and were observed for a mean of 34 months. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients and 30 of 36 patients (83%) experienced complete cessation of bleeding after the Young's procedure. Patients had a mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.68 g/dL after the procedure. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory score after surgery was 43.56. No patients requested a reversal of the procedure. The Young's procedure is a safe and efficacious procedure with complete cessation of epistaxis in most patients with severe epistaxis and HHT.

"	"Angiokeratomas are papular telangiectasias having a common histology of ectasia of the superficial dermal vessels surmounted by a hyperkeratotic epidermis. The patient was a 9-year-old girl born of non-consanguineous parents after a well-followed pregnancy with problem-free delivery at term. From birth, she had a tumefaction of the left side of the nose and the left half of the upper lip that gradually increased in size without obstructing the nasal orifice and bled easily. Examination revealed the presence of tumefaction of the left nostril and the left half of the upper lip projecting towards the contralateral side especially in the nose. It was soft and painless, with the presence at the surface of dull red keratotic papules of 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Examination of the nasal mucosa revealed the same appearance of papules. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare congenital malformation, the rarest of five types. Since its initial description in 1890, few cases have been reported. However, female predominance has been noted with a male/female sex ratio of 1/3. It appears to be due to a genetic mutation that is probably autosomal, but the site of which is still unknown. In view of the special features of this case, several diagnoses were suggested, including Rendu Osler's disease, superficial lymphangioma and verrucous angioma. The particularity of this case is that it includes the first description of this site, which posed a therapeutic problem, especially concerning the choice of laser type to be used.

"	"The olfactory and gustatory functions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients have not been documented by validated tests. Disorders of the nasal/oral cavity may interfere with the olfactory and gustatory functions. Fifty-four HHT patients were investigated by smell/taste tests. HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests. HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life.

23320130	"Oxidative stress contributes to endothelial dysfunction in mouse models of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) or activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1; HHT2) genes, coding for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily receptors. We demonstrated previously that endoglin and ALK1 interact with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and affect its activation. Endothelial cells deficient in endoglin or ALK1 proteins show eNOS uncoupling, reduced NO, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we measured NO and H(2)O(2) levels in several organs of adult Eng and Alk1 heterozygous mice, to ascertain whether decreased NO and increased ROS production is a generalized manifestation of HHT. A significant reduction in NO and increase in ROS production were found in several organs, known to be affected in patients. ROS overproduction in mutant mice was attributed to eNOS, as it was L-NAME inhibitable. Mitochondrial ROS contribution, blocked by antimycin, was highest in liver while NADPH oxidase, inhibited by apocynin, was a major source of ROS in the other tissues. However, there was no difference in antimycin- and apocynin-inhibitable ROS production between mutant and control mice. Our results indicate that eNOS-derived ROS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and likely predisposes to disease manifestations in several organs of HHT patients.

Retrospective chart review of 55 consecutive HHT patients undergoing a bevacizumab injection for recalcitrant epistaxis. Nineteen patients received local injections to only the SP vasculature, and 36 patients received AP and SP injections. Main outcome variable was estimated blood loss during nasal surgery. Independent variables included sex, age, epistaxis severity score, surgical techniques (including laser), and blood pressure parameters (baseline, preinduction, and postintubation). The mean blood loss in HHT patients receiving SP injections alone was 111 mL, whereas it was 22 mL for those receiving both AP + SP injections. This difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = .075). Blood pressure parameters were similar in both groups with no appreciable difference between intraoperative systolic and mean arterial blood pressure.

23675457	"Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.

"	"The vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is in general an inherited disease caused by mutations in the TGF-β/BMP receptors endoglin or ALK1 or in rare cases by mutations of the TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad4 leading to the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT. HHT is characterized by several clinical symptoms like spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases at sites like lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose, and visceral lesions like gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations. The disease shows an inter- and intra-family variability in penetrance as well as symptoms from mild to life threatening. Penetrance is also depending on age. Diagnosis of the disease is based on the presence of some of the listed symptoms or by genetic testing. HHT diagnosis is laborious, time consuming, costly and sometimes uncertain. Not all typical symptoms may be present, especially at a younger age, and genetic testing does not always identify the disease causing mutation. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was investigated as a potential alternative to the current diagnostic methods. IR-spectra were obtained by Fourier-transform Mid-IR spectroscopy from blood plasma from HHT patients and a healthy control group. Spectral data were mathematically processed and subsequently classified and analysed by artificial neural network (ANN) analyses and by visual analysis of scatter plots of the dominant principal components. The analyses showed that for HHT a disease specific IR-spectrum exists that is significantly different from the control group. Furthermore, at the current stage with the here used methods, HHT can be diagnosed by Mid-IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%. Visual analysis of PCA scatter plots revealed an inter class variation of the HHT group. IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis can be considered to be a serious alternative diagnostic method compared to clinical and genetically based methods. Blood plasma is an ideal candidate for diagnostic purposes, it is inexpensive, easy to isolate and only minimal amounts are required. In addition, IR-spectroscopy measurement times are fast, less than one minute, and diagnosis is not based on interpretation of may be uncertain clinical data. And last but not least, the method is inexpensive.

"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels, with shunting of blood from the arterial to venous circulation and a high risk of rupture and intracranial hemorrhage. Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM. A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM. We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis.

In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

"	"To assess the safety and efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency (RF) treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with mild or moderate epistaxis. We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT), also known as the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a multiorganic vascular disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Diagnostic clinical criteria include: epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance. HHT is transmitted in 90% of the cases as an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in either endoglin (ENG), or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) genes (HHT type 1 and 2, respectively). We have carried out a genetic analysis of four independent Spanish families with HHT clinical criteria, which has permitted the identification of new large deletions in ENG. These mutations were first detected using the MLPA technique and subsequently, the deletion breakpoints were mapped using a customized copy number variation (CNV) microarray. The array was designed to cover the ENG gene and surrounding areas. All tested families carried large deletions ranging from 3-kb to 100-kb, involving the ENG gene promoter, several ENG exons, and the two downstream genes FGSH and CDK9. Interestingly, common breakpoints coincident with Alu repetitive sequences were found among these families. The systematic hybridization of DNA from HHT families, with deletions or duplications, to custom designed microarrays, could allow the mapping of breakpoints, coincident with repetitive Alu sequences that might act as ""hot spots"" in the development of chromosomal anomalies.

24273414	"Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. **SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.** Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, **a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted.** The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. **This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years.** Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.

24489709	"ENDOGLIN is dispensable for vasculogenesis, but required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis
"	"ENDOGLIN (ENG) is a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members that is highly expressed in endothelial cells and has a critical function in the development of the vascular system. Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

24499751	"Outcomes of pregnancy in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"To describe pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a retrospective descriptive study of women with HHT (18-55 years of age) from the Toronto HHT Database using a telephone questionnaire regarding pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.

24520391	"Novel brain arteriovenous malformation mouse models for type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have a higher prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) than the general population and patients with other HHT subtypes. The pathogenesis of brain AVM in HHT1 patients is currently unknown and no specific medical therapy is available to treat patients. Proper animal models are crucial for identifying the underlying mechanisms for brain AVM development and for testing new therapies. However, creating HHT1 brain AVM models has been quite challenging because of difficulties related to deleting Eng-floxed sequence in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice. To create an HHT1 brain AVM mouse model, we used several Cre transgenic mouse lines to delete Eng in different cell-types in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice: R26CreER (all cell types after tamoxifen treatment), SM22α-Cre (smooth muscle and endothelial cell) and LysM-Cre (lysozyme M-positive macrophage). An adeno-associated viral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (AAV-VEGF) was injected into the brain to induce focal angiogenesis. We found that SM22α-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo caused AVMs in the postnatal brain, spinal cord, and intestines. Induction of Eng deletion in adult mice using R26CreER plus local VEGF stimulation induced the brain AVM phenotype. In both models, Eng-null endothelial cells were detected in the brain AVM lesions, and formed mosaicism with wildtype endothelial cells. However, LysM-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo did not cause AVM in the postnatal brain even after VEGF stimulation. In this study, we report two novel HHT1 brain AVM models that mimic many phenotypes of human brain AVM and can thus be used for studying brain AVM pathogenesis and testing new therapies. Further, our data indicate that macrophage Eng deletion is insufficient and that endothelial Eng homozygous deletion is required for HHT1 brain AVM development.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) play an important role in vascular repair and regeneration. This study was designed to examine the function of CACs derived from patients with HHT. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients with HHT and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed for expression of CD34, CD133 and VEGF receptor 2 by flow cytometry. PBMNCs were cultured to procure early outgrowth CACs. Development of endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in CACs was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CAC apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V staining, and CAC migration assessed by a modified Boyden chamber assay. mRNA expression of endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVLR1 or ALK1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in CACs was measured by real time RT-PCR. The percentage of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs from HHT patients was significantly higher than in PBMNCs of healthy controls. CACs derived from patients with HHT not only showed a significant reduction in EC-selective surface markers following 7-day culture, but also a significant increase in the rate of basal apoptosis and blunted migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. CACs from HHT patients expressed significantly lower levels of ENG, ALK1 and eNOS mRNAs. In conclusion, **CACs from patients with HHT exhibited various functional impairments, suggesting a reduced regenerative capacity of CACs to repair the vascular lesions seen in HHT patients.**

For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary.

25763011	"Contribution of oxidative stress to endothelial dysfunction in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.

25815003	"Genetic variation in the functional ENG allele inherited from the non-affected parent associates with presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 (HHT1) and may influence expression of PTPN14
"	"HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.

25862798	"Complications and mortality in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A population-based study
"	"Studies report that the risks of significant neurologic complications (including stroke, cerebral abscess, and migraine) and hemorrhagic sequelae are high in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), and that life expectancy in this cohort is reduced. However, most published cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias. We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also long-term survival of those with the disease. From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis (OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at death 3 years younger. Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is required.

25931195	"Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by abnormal vascular structures that may present as epistaxis, telangiectasias, and/or arteriovenous malformations. The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGFβ pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGFβ signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder associated with pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), present in about 30-50% of patients. Dyspnea is frequently reported by about one-half of patients with PAVMs and has been related to the degree of right to left shunting. However, many HHT patients with PAVMs remain asymptomatic and those without PAVMs have been observed to have dyspnea, the cause of which has not been characterized. **The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of dyspnea and its etiology in the HHT population**. Retrospective review of over 1000 patients at an HHT Center of Excellence from 1997 to 2010. Patients were categorized as definite HHT if they met ≥3 clinical diagnostic criteria or had a positive genetic diagnosis. Patients were unlikely to have HHT (non-HHT) if they had 1 or fewer diagnostic criteria. Data on dyspnea prevalence (MMRC ≥ 1), PAVMs, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, symptomatic liver venous malformations, anemia and obesity was reviewed. 506 patients were categorized as having HHT, of which 202 (40%) had confirmed PAVMs. Dyspnea prevalence was 35% (178/506) vs. 18% (50/284, p < 0.0001) in the HHT and non-HHT patients, respectively. With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of dyspnea (MMRC ≥1) was 3.45 (95% CI 2.08-5.71) with the presence of PAVMs in HHT patients. Other independent predictors of dyspnea were older age, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, anemia, and obesity. Prevalence of dyspnea is significant, evident in about one-third of HHT patients, often associated with PAVMs. It is important to consider other etiologies for dyspnea when assessing patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease defined by the presence of epistaxis and mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in internal organs. In most families (~85%), HHT is caused by mutations in the ENG (HHT1) or the ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes. Here, we report the results of genetic testing of 113 Norwegian families with suspected or definite HHT. **Variants in ENG and ACVRL1 were found in 105 families (42 ENG, 63 ACVRL1), including six novel variants of uncertain pathogenic significance**. Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway. We discuss the importance of founder mutations and present a thorough evaluation of missense and splice-site variants.

"	"The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present **three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients.** Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. **All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001).** The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials. 4.

26646071	"Endoglin regulates mural cell adhesion in the circulatory system
"	"The circulatory system is walled off by different cell types, including vascular mural cells and podocytes. The interaction and interplay between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes, play a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is an RGD-containing counter-receptor for β1 integrins and is highly expressed by ECs during angiogenesis. We find that the adhesion between vascular ECs and mural cells is enhanced by integrin activators and inhibited upon suppression of membrane endoglin or β1-integrin, as well as by addition of soluble endoglin (SolEng), anti-integrin α5β1 antibody or an RGD peptide. Analysis of different endoglin mutants, allowed the mapping of the endoglin RGD motif as involved in the adhesion process. In Eng (+/-) mice, a model for hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia type 1, endoglin haploinsufficiency induces a pericyte-dependent increase in vascular permeability. Also, transgenic mice overexpressing SolEng, an animal model for preeclampsia, show podocyturia, suggesting that SolEng is responsible for podocytes detachment from glomerular capillaries. These results suggest a critical role for endoglin in integrin-mediated adhesion of mural cells and provide a better understanding on the mechanisms of vessel maturation in normal physiology as well as in pathologies such as preeclampsia or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

The nasal closure procedure may be underutilized because of its surgical complexity and flap breakdown. **This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013.** Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient. The technique is described. **We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure.** The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had** an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures**. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3. Comparison of 5 patients who underwent the traditional 3-flap nasal closure procedure and 8 patients receiving the 2-flap nasal closure showed no significant difference in postoperative ESS or GBI metrics. Mean operating room times of the traditional and simplified methods were 3.12 hours and 1.44 hours (p = 0.0001). Mean time to first revision for 8 nasal closure patients was 21.5 months.

26801773	"Novel homozygous BMP9 nonsense mutation causes pulmonary arterial hypertension: a case report
"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, fatal vascular disorder. Genetic predisposition plays vital roles in the development of PAH, with most mutations being identified in genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Defects in the BMP9 gene have been documented in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the most common inherited vascular disorder, which is occasionally associated with PAH. Selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR2 with BMP9 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension. We report the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic boy who was diagnosed with severe PAH and right heart failure at 3 years of age. During his stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, treatment was initiated with inhaled nitric oxide and intravenous epoprostenol; he subsequently was transitioned to treprostinil, sildenafil, and prophylactic enoxaparin. Now, two years later, the child is asymptomatic on sildenafil, bosentan, subcutaneous treprostinil, and warfarin. Genetic screening revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the BMP9 gene (c.76C > T; p.Gln26Ter). The child had no telangiectasias or arteriovenous malformations; family history also was negative. Subsequent parental testing showed both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation, indicating that the child inherited the BMP9 mutant allele from each parent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP9 mutation in a patient with PAH. The homozygous nonsense mutation may account for the early onset and severity of PAH in this patient and also fit the 'two-hit' model we proposed previously. The absence of clinical symptoms for PAH in the parents may be due to incomplete penetrance or various expressivities of the BMP9 mutations. Our study expands the spectrum of phenotypes related to BMP9 mutations.

All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations.

A CT scan showed haemothorax and a bleeding arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left lung. Family history suggested the possibility of HHT**. After multidisciplinary consideration, **a primary caesarean section was performed, followed by embolisation of the AVM during the same surgical session**. The patient had a gene mutation consistent with HHT type 2. Pregnant patients with HHT are at risk of serious morbidity, especially if they are not screened for AVMs. A multidisciplinary approach for such patients, with consideration of various scenarios, is highly recommended.

27424345	"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: importance of a multidisciplinary approach
"	"The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT**. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility)**. Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.

"	"An intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula(dAVF)was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old man during a medical checkup. Except for a mild episode of pneumonia at the age of 22 years, his medical history was unremarkable. He had no family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia(HHT). T**he dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. **Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.

27646277	"Defective fluid shear stress mechanotransduction mediates hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

"	"**To evaluate if _injection of intravenous particles_ may provoke migraines in subjects with right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)**. Migraine headaches commonly affect people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), especially those with pulmonary AVMs that provide right-to-left shunts. In our clinical practice, patients occasionally reported acute precipitation of migraine headaches following injection of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates for nuclear medicine scans. Self-reported migraine features and exacerbations were examined in HHT subjects with and without pulmonary AVMs, for a series of noninvasive and invasive investigations,** using an unbiased online survey**. One hundred and sixty-six subjects were classified as having both HHT and migraines. **HHT subjects with migraines were more likely to have pulmonary AVMs** (P < .0001). **HHT subjects with pulmonary AVMs were more likely to report photophobia (P = .010), ""flashes of light"" (P = .011), or transient visual loss (P = .040). **Pulse oximetry, x-rays, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans without intravenous contrast medium rarely, if ever, provoked migraines, but unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to exacerbate migraines by 14/124 (11.2%) subjects. One hundred and fourteen subjects had both enhanced and unenhanced CT examinations: studies with contrast media were more commonly reported to start (9/114 [7.8%]), and/or worsen migraines (18/114 [15.7%]), compared to those undertaken without contrast medium (P < .01), or after simple blood tests (P < .05). Additionally, migraine exacerbation was reported by 9/90 (10%) after contrast echocardiography, 2/44 (4.5%) after nuclear medicine scans, and 10/154 (6.5%) after blood tests. HHT subjects frequently report migraine exacerbation following blood tests, contrast echocardiograms, MRI imaging, and CT studies performed with intravenous contrast medium. Since air emboli are recognized to complicate intravenous injections, particularly those given by a pressurized pump during contrast enhanced CT, future studies should re-evaluate whether particulate emboli provoke migraines.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. **A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. **She denied any symptoms except recurrent **epistaxis**. A computed tomography (CT) scan reveale**d a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. **We performed** open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs**. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

HHT is characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and vascular visceral dysplasia responsible for visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). to report the experience of two university hospitals (Trousseau, Paris, and CHIC, Creteil) with screening children for HHT and pulmonary AVM (PAVM) using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). parents with confirmed HHT were offered to have their children screened for the mutation identified in their family, and informed consent was obtained. Children carrying the same mutation as their parents underwent HRCT of the chest without contrast. between 2008 and 2015, 99 children were screened for HHT mutations. Mutations were identified in 59 patients, that is 24 HHT1 and 35 HHT2. Radiologic and clinical screening was possible in 52 patients (21 HHT-1 and 31 HHT-2). Among those, PAVM was identified in 13 patients (25%; n = 8 HHT1; n = 5 HHT2), and four of them required embolization therapy. This study highlights the usefulness of genetic screening in children with known HHT family. It also suggests that a non-invasive protocol such as HRTC is an efficient approach to detect non-symptomatic lesions that are present early on in children carrying the ENG (HHT1), but also the ACVRL1 mutations (HHT2).

"	"PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. **To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life**. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.

For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. **The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. **Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.

A spectrum of vascular variants can involve the liver. Some of these variants may result in areas of enhancement that can mimic more serious pathologic conditions. In this article**, the authors discuss a spectrum of variants and pathologic conditions that may involve the liver vasculature. **These include variants, anomalies, and diseases involving the portal vein, such as rudimentary portal vein, thrombosis, cavernous transformation, thrombotic angiitis, thrombophlebitis, transient hepatic attenuation difference or transient hepatic intensity difference, portal venous aneurysm, and portal vein gas. The hepatic artery can be involved by various diseases, including thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Unusual ""third inflow"" sources of venous inflow are also discussed, including aberrant right gastric vein, aberrant left gastric vein, epigastric-paraumbilical veins, and cholecystic vein. A spectrum of variants and diseases involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, including thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, stenosis, torsion, congestive hepatopathy, and peliosis hepatis, are discussed. Vascular shunts are illustrated, including portosystemic shunts (intra- and extrahepatic), arterioportal shunt, shunts of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and acquired arteriovenous fistula.

"	"It is well described that patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) have an increased risk of cerebral abscess (CA). However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%. The 3-month and 1-year mortality rates were 7.5% and 11.25%, respectively. There is an overrepresentation of HHT patients in a cohort of patients with CA, and HHT should be investigated as the cause of the CA if no other apparent cause can be identified.

28608633	"Asymptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Children with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) may have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, clubbing, cyanosis and hemoptysis. However, some patients with pulmonary AVMs may be asymptomatic, placing them at risk for complications such as stroke or brain abscess if they are not identified and treated. **This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs.** Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.

"	"Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables real-time optical biopsy. Little is known about pCLE imaging deep inside the small bowel, therefore the aim of this study was to determine its usefulness. Between April 2014 and January 2016, we performed 38 pCLE examinations during double-balloon enteroscopy with intravenous fluorescein in 37 patients with: tumors (n = 10), vascular disorders (n = 6), inflammatory diseases and drug injuries (n = 13), other disorders (n = 4), and normal findings (n = 4). We measured the calibers of capillary and lymphatic vessels at 15 different sites and compared the calibers between pCLE images and histopathology. We also compared pCLE findings with pathologic diagnosis. T**he inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology.** In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %). pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.

"	"t Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterized by the abnormal development of blood vessels. While the pathophysiology underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with HHT is not fully understood, it is believed to occur by one of two mechanisms: increases in pulmonary vascular resistance or cardiac output. In the following report, we describe an interesting case of a 26-year-old woman with HHT whose right heart catheterization initially demonstrated PH with elements of both pre- and post-capillary PH. Once the pre-capillary PH component was treated, however, an underlying high-normal cardiac-output state was unmasked. [Full article available at http://rimed.org/rimedicaljournal-2017-08.asp].

"	"The implications of basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity remain unclear in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This study was performed to assess the prevalence of this imaging finding in a large cohort of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and **to identify any association between this phenomenon and other disease manifestations.** In this retrospective study, we identified all patients at our institution diagnosed with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia from 2001 to 2017. Patients who did not undergo brain MR imaging were excluded. Patient demographics, laboratory results, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease characteristics were noted. **Basal ganglia hyperintensity was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively relative to the signal intensity in the ipsilateral thalami.** Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available software. A total of 312 patients (41% men, 59% women; mean age, 51 ± 18 years) with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were identified. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity was present in 23.4% of patients and demonstrated a statistically significant association with older age (P < .001), increased hepatic AVMs (P < .001), high cardiac output state (P < .001), hepatic failure (P = .01), elevated peak serum alkaline phosphatase level (P = .03), and increased total bilirubin count (P = .03). There was no significant association with sex, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia genetic mutation status, parkinsonism, or serum transaminase levels. B**asal ganglia T1 hyperintensity occurs in >23% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is associated with hepatic vascular malformations, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated cardiac output. **The presence of this finding on screening MR imaging in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should prompt further evaluation for visceral lesions causing arteriovenous shunting.

"	"To discuss an uncommon case of a patient with multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) presenting with dyspnea on exertion and recurrent strokes. A 79-year-old woman with recent onset recurrent cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) was referred to cardiology for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. Clinical examination was unrevealing. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with agitated saline was suggestive of an extra-cardiac shunt. Subsequent chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated five large PAVMs. **The patient underwent transcatheter coil embolization of the five PAVMs, resulting in marked improvement in dyspnea and resolution of the shunt on bubble study echocardiography**. Although PAVMs are rare, they remain an important entity to consider when evaluating patients with extracardiac shunts. They may present with nonspecific features such as dyspnea on exertion and recurrent CVAs. All patients with multiple PAVMs should undergo thorough skin screening for telangiectasia as well as radiologic imaging to screen for additional AVMs in the liver and brain in order to exclude hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

"	"To investigate the clinical features and feasibility genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) family, and to explore the application of gene mutation testing in HHT diagnosis.  Methods: Medical histories and clinical features of a family were analyzed to diagnose HHT patients and suspected individuals according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family. A combination of clinical and genetic diagnosis could improve the diagnosis and treatment of HHT.

29080903	"Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions
"	"Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, w**e hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. **We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.

"	"Our objective was to describe epistaxis onset and severity in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients and study the cumulative incidence of epistaxis by age of onset within each genetic subtype. Retrospective cohort chart review. Charts were reviewed of patients age 0 to 18 years with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of HHT who were evaluated at a tertiary multidisciplinary HHT clinic from January 2010 to June 2016. The epistaxis severity score (ESS), a validated tool for assessing epistaxis severity, was used to assess epistaxis. S**tatistical analyses were conducted on the full HHT cohort as well as subgroups stratified by the HHT causative gene** (HHT1 = ENG and HHT2 = ACVRL1). Sixty-nine pediatric subjects were identified; 60 had HHT confirmed by genetic testing, and nine (from families with known mutations) met published clinical diagnostic criteria alone. Fifty-nine (85%) had onset of epistaxis. The median age of onset of epistaxis was 5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-9 years). The median ESS for the entire cohort was 1.6 (IQR: 0-2.6). The median ESS was higher in HHT1 versus HHT2 (2.3 vs. 1.1, P = .002), and age of epistaxis onset was earlier in HHT1 (3 vs. 5 years, P = .03). Sex and age were not associated with ESS. Epistaxis may present early in HHT, but is typically mild in the pediatric period. **Severity in the pediatric population is worse in patients with HHT1. **By recognizing the significance of even mild, infrequent epistaxis in a child with a family history of HHT, and understanding that not all HHT patients have epistaxis during childhood, community providers and otolaryngologist can assist in the early detection of HHT. 4 Laryngoscope, 128:1714-1719, 2018.

29253907	"Inhibiting DPP4 in a mouse model of HHT1 results in a shift towards regenerative macrophages and reduces fibrosis after myocardial infarction
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

"	"To present a multiyear clinical experience with intravenous bevacizumab for the management of severe gastrointestinal bleeding and/or epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). All patients treated with intravenous bevacizumab for severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related bleeding from June 1, 2013, through January 31, 2017, were included in this report. Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients. Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores (P<.001) and RBC transfusion requirements (P=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function. Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship as well as clinical, genetic, and biomarker predictors of response.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels due to mutations in specific genes that lead to angiogenesis errors. HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. **Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, **at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.

HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid. HHT-PAH patients may have a worse prognosis than matched IPAH patients. **Baseline total bilirubin may be a promising predictor for the long-term prognosis in HHT-PAH patients.**

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and multisystem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2). This robust patient cohort of brain AVMs in 39 patients with HHT advances the collective understanding of this disease's varied presentation, diagnostic workup, genetic underpinnings, and available treatment options.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations affecting various organs and systems. The liver is a commonly involved organ (74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), although symptomatic liver disease is quite infrequent. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations relate most commonly to the predominant type of vascular shunting present (arteriovenous, arterioportal, or portovenous). Clinically, liver disease can manifest as a high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, or biliary disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up of liver involvement, with ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography being useful in this context. **We present a case of congestive cirrhosis with florid liver findings in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Imaging findings that clinched the diagnosis are reviewed. A brief literature review is also provided.**

"	"There is little published literature regarding the impact of age on outcomes amongst hospitalized HHT (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) patients. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to obtain data on all hospital discharges occurring in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012. The association between admission age and HHT-related complications and outcomes were studied. 10293 hospitalizations in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012 were included. Patients > 50 accounted for 77% of all admissions with 30% of admissions occurring in the 51-65 age group. Bleeding related complications were the most frequent (62.7%,n= 6455 hospitalizations), followed by cardiovascular (41%,n= 4216), neurological (12.4%,n= 1276), and hepatobiliary (6.4%,n= 660) complications. Patients older than 50 accounted for 83% of bleeding events, 90% of cardiovascular events, 58% of neurologic events, and 81% of hepatobiliary events. T**he vast majority (83%) of medical and surgical procedures were performed in those older than 50 years of age.** Older patients also experienced higher rates of death.

"	"Background: Mesenchymal dysplasias or inherited connective tissue diseases are the group of diseases with deficiency of various components of connective tissue. Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton, sight organ, skin, lungs, heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage, especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels.Aim: **To evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias.**Study design: Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias, including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome (I group), 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (II group), and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) (III group) of the age from 18 to 36. **The study included retrospective analysis (for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study**. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery, especially the risk of hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vessel growth that results in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia.** We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea.** Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.

Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE. In conclusion, we observed an improvement in Hgb and/or epistaxis in all treated patients. This occurred at a dose much lower than typically used for oncologic indications, with no serious AE.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be found in patients suffering from a loss-of-function mutation of the gene encoding for the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1 receptor. Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as e**pistaxis.** Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here,** we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH**. Recently, it was shown that **tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling **and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with **low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.**

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with HHT can develop vascular dysplasias called telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.

"	"Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. We provide a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT, with a focus on the risk of recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010, with a survival of more than 1 year. Protocol clinical, radiological, and histological examinations were performed at regular intervals. Fourteen patients were included (13 women and one man). Median age at LT was 52.5 years (range: 33.1-66.7). In eight patients (seven female), disease recurrence was diagnosed by abnormal radiological features, suggestive of microcirculatory disturbances. Typical vascular lesions, including telangiectasia, were demonstrated by liver biopsy in five of these patients. The median interval between LT and diagnosis of recurrence was 127 months (range: 74-184). The risk of recurrence increased over time; estimated cumulative risk was 47.9% at 15 years. Liver tissue analysis found the coexistence of an angiogenic process combined with endothelial microchimerism, as shown by the presence of vascular lining cells of recipient origin. Conclusion: The present data show that disease recurrence occurs, usually after a long delay, in a significant number of patients treated by LT for liver complications of HHT. This strongly supports the necessity of a lifelong follow-up and suggests that therapeutic strategy needs discussion and evaluation, especially of the role of potential adjuvant treatments to LT, such as antiangiogenic medications, when recurrent disease appears.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic vascular disease with a wordwide prevalence of 1:5000-1:10000. We introduce our algorithm for the stratified population screening of HHT. Probands are selected from the consecutive hospital database review for HHT (I7800) and recurrent epistaxis (R0400) and the review of patient records referred by family practicioners. A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), **developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs)** classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001). Thalidomide AEs occurred at more similar rates in males (25 AEs in 41 men, 60.9%) and females (12 in 26 (46.2%), but were more common in ENG patients (17 in 17) than in ACVRL1 (14 in 34, p < 0.0001). For bevacizumab, the most common reports were of joint pains (7/69, 10%), headache (3/69, 4.4%) and proteinuria (2/69, 3%), and for thalidomide, peripheral neuropathy (12/67, 18%); drowsiness (8/67, 12%); and dizziness (6/67, 9%). Fatal adverse events were more common in males (p = 0.009), and in patients with ENG pathogenic variants (p = 0.012). One fatal AE was possibly related to bevacizumab (average incidence rate: 1.5 per 100 person-years); 3 fatal AEs were possibly related to thalidomide (average incidence rate: 4 per 100 person-years). With potential increase in use of Bevacizumab and Thalidomide in HHT patients, data presented support appropriate weighing of the toxicities which can arise in HHT settings and the practice recommendations for their prevention and management.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF), a vessel malformation connecting the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation while bypassing the pulmonary capillaries, can cause paradoxical cerebral infarction. It is often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic disease characterized by multiple dermal, mucosal, and visceral telangiectasia causing recurrent bleeding. Paradoxical cerebral embolism caused by PAVF without HHT is rare. Here, we report a patient with isolated PAVF who experienced an ischemic stroke caused by a paradoxical embolism from deep venous thrombosis; t**he patient was successfully treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.** She presented with a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation to 91%, and lung disease was suspected. A PAVF was subsequently found in the right S6 region using contrast computed tomography. Interventional radiologists successfully occluded the shunt using 6 microcoils. PAVF should be considered when determining the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in patients with hypoxia, which can be the only symptom of PAVF.

"	"To assess pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) growth among patients with untreated PAVMs using imaging from long-term follow-up per hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia international guidelines. Analysis included 88 untreated PAVMs from 21 patients (6 male;15 female; mean age at presentation 47 y; range, 12-68 y). Two CT studies with the longest interval between were evaluated (mean 8.4 y; median 8.8 y; range, 3.1-14.1 y). Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up. Model-based mean analysis showed no statistically significant change in dimension of any variable between earliest and follow-up imaging. Secondary analysis including age also found no statistically significant difference (feeding diameter, P = .09; AP sac dimension, P = .9; ML sac dimension, P = .1). Analysis including time between measurements found no significant relationship between change in variables and time (feeding artery diameter, P = .4; AP sac dimension, P = .3; ML sac dimension, P = .06). Untreated PAVMs grew slowly, if at all, in a near-decade span, and any demonstrated growth was minimal. These findings challenge the current recommendation of 3- to 5-year CT follow-up.

31360828	"Topically Applied Etamsylate: A New Orphan Drug for HHT-Derived Epistaxis (Antiangiogenesis through FGF Pathway Inhibition)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). **The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor**. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

Recurrent epistaxis is the primary complaint in 90%-96% of HHT patients and the other symptoms come with age. **The aim of this study was to analyze HHT-associated gene variant spectrum in Chinese HHT patients and to assess whether genetic testing could contribute to the early diagnosis.** Thirty one HHT families including 62 individuals were recruited. Variants in the coding regions of four genes involved in HHT were amplified and analyzed using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twenty unique variants, including 8 novel variants were found in 24 of the 31 (77.4%) kindred. Diagnosis is confirmed for 7 possible individuals from 6 kindred. Thirteen ACVRL1 variants were detected from 17 isolated HHT families. Variants in ACVRL1 from 8/17 (47.1%) families were located in exon8. Seven ENG variants were found in 7 unrelated families throughout the coding region. We conclude that ACVRL1 gene variant is 2.4 times more prevalent than that in ENG in Chinese individuals with HHT, and exon8 of the ACVRL1 gene may be a hotspot region. Genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis for HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea. We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: (""hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia"" AND ""Korea"") OR (""Osler-Weber-Rendu"" AND ""Korea""). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea. We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. **Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations. **The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.

"	"Endoglin is a 180-kDa glycoprotein receptor primarily expressed by the vascular endothelium and involved in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene (ENG) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, a vascular disease that presents with nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. A circulating form of endoglin (alias soluble endoglin, sEng), proteolytically released from the membrane-bound protein, has been observed in several inflammation-related pathological conditions and appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cancer development through unknown mechanisms. Membrane-bound endoglin is an auxiliary component of the TGF-β receptor complex and the extracellular region of endoglin has been shown to interact with types I and II TGF-β receptors, as well as with BMP9 and BMP10 ligands, both members of the TGF-β family. To search for novel protein interactors, we screened a microarray containing over 9000 unique human proteins using recombinant sEng as bait. We find that sEng binds with high affinity, at least, to 22 new proteins. Among these, we validated the interaction of endoglin with galectin-3, a secreted member of the lectin family with capacity to bind membrane glycoproteins, and with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Using human endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that endoglin co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with galectin-3 or TRIM21. These results open new research avenues on endoglin function and regulation.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder **characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)** that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. **Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.**

"	"Impaired ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1)/Endoglin/BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) signaling predisposes to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activation of SMAD1/5 signaling can be enhanced by shear stress. In the genetic disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is characterized by arteriovenous malformations, the affected receptors are those involved in the activation of mechanosensitive SMAD1/5 signaling. To elucidate how genetic and mechanical signals interact in AVM development, we sought to identify targets differentially regulated by BMP9 and shear stress. Approach and Results: We identify Cx37 (Connexin37) as a differentially regulated target of ligand-induced and mechanotransduced SMAD1/5 signaling. We show that stimulation of endothelial cells with BMP9 upregulated Cx37, whereas shear stress inhibited this expression. This signaling was SMAD1/5-dependent, and in the absence of SMAD1/5, there was an inversion of the expression pattern. Ablated SMAD1/5 signaling alone caused AVM-like vascular malformations directly connecting the dorsal aorta to the inlet of the heart. In yolk sacs of mouse embryos with an endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5, addition of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), which downregulates Cx37, induced development of these direct connections bypassing the yolk sac capillary bed. In wild-type embryos undergoing vascular remodeling, Cx37 was globally expressed by endothelial cells but was absent in regions of enlarging vessels. TNFα and endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5 caused ectopic regions lacking Cx37 expression, which correlated to areas of vascular malformations. Mechanistically, loss of Cx37 impairs correct directional migration under flow conditions. Our data demonstrate that Cx37 expression is differentially regulated by shear stress and SMAD1/5 signaling, and that reduced Cx37 expression is permissive for capillary enlargement into shunts.

"	"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that causes frequent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Four genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) have been identified as pathogenic in HHT. We describe the case of a 50-year-old Japanese man highly suspected of having HHT due to recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and a family history. Genomic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation of c.100T>A, p.Cys34Ser in the patient's ACVRL1 gene. We used 6 freeware programs to perform an in silico analysis of this mutation. The results demonstrated the mutation's high pathogenicity.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often involves the liver, and belongs to abnormal blood vessel disease. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is not clear, but congenital vascular dysplasia is considered to be one of the causes. Liver cirrhosis due to hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia concomitant with BCS has not been reported. Here, we report a case of cirrhosis with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHHT) and BCS. A 58-year-old woman with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia showed decompensated liver cirrhosis, and abdominal imaging revealed Budd-Chiari syndrome. Disease has progressed considerably during 2.5 years after hospital discharge despite subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). One hypothesis that might explain the coexistence of hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome in this patient is ischemia and thrombosis of hepatic veins. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between HHHT and BCS. Our observations already challenged the TIPS therapeutic strategy in BCS secondary to HHHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Disease-causing variants in endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) genes are detected in more than 90% of cases submitted to molecular diagnosis. We used data from the RiHHTa (Computerized Registry of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) registry to describe genetic variants and to assess their genotype-phenotype correlation among HHT patients in Spain. By May 2019, 215 patients were included in the RiHHTa registry with a mean age of 52.5 ± 16.5 years and 136 (63.3%) were women. Definitive HHT diagnosis defined by the Curaçao criteria were met by 172 (80%) patients. Among 113 patients with genetic test, 77 (68.1%) showed a genetic variant in ACVRL1 and 36 (31.8%) in ENG gene. The identified genetic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG genes and their clinical significance are provided. ACVRL1 mutations were more frequently nonsense (50%) while ENG mutations were more frequently, frameshift (39.1%). ENG patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36.9 vs 45.7 years) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (71.4% vs 24.4%) and cerebral AVMs (17.6% vs 2%) more often than patients with ACVRL1 variants. Patients with ACVRL1 variants had a higher cardiac index (2.62 vs 3.46), higher levels of hepatic functional blood tests, and anemia (28.5% vs 56.7%) more often than ENG patients. ACVRL1 variants are more frequent than ENG in Spain. ACVRL1 patients developed symptomatic liver disease and anemia more often than ENG patients. Compared to ACVRL1, those with ENG variants are younger at diagnosis and show pulmonary and cerebral AVMs more frequently.

"	"Objective: To explore the value of right heart contrast echocardiography in etiological diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 patients who underwent transthoracic contrast echocardiography in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from May 2015 to July 2018, all of whom were diagnosed as PH by right heart catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups according to contrast echocardiography: the intra-cardiac shunt group (<4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); Intrapulmonary shunt group (>4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); non-shunt group. The etiology, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PO(2)), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central nervous system complications were also compared among the three groups. Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.

32538908	"Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization in Zebrafish Embryos and Tube Formation Assay in iPSC-ECs to Study the Role of Endoglin in Vascular Development
"	"Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.

One week before her surgery, her mother at 32 weeks of gestation underwent emergency surgery for hemothorax caused by pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture. Both were diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The indications for treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in young patients remain controversial because the risk of complications concerning pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is lower in young patients than in adult patients. We recommend that aggressive treatment should be performed for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis with a family history of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture even if the patient is asymptomatic and young, because such patients may have a high risk of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture.

Retrospective cohort study of 54 children diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at a tertiary care center. All neuroimaging was reviewed to assess for number and types of cerebrovascular malformations and for intracerebral hemorrhage and arterial ischemic stroke. Clinical charts were reviewed for clinical manifestations, genetic mutation, and clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhages and arterial ischemic strokes. Among 54 children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a median age of 3.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 7.9 years) at diagnosis, neuroimaging was performed in 52 (96.3%) at a median age of 5.2 years (interquartile range 1.8 to 9 years). Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The three children with intracerebral hemorrhage presented at young ages (4.3 to 7.7 years). More than a quarter of children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who were imaged had cerebrovascular malformations, and overt stroke occurred in more than 10%. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients at young ages, and new cerebral arteriovenous malformations may develop over time. Early screening with neuroimaging including neurovascular imaging as well as repeat neuroimaging may be warranted in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

32762495	"Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.

To develop and validate an epistaxis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure for HHT. This survey study focused on the development and validation of the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis (NOSE) in HTT (NOSE HHT) outcome measure with data prospectively collected from December 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. A total of 401 patients were recruited from within the Cure Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia online patient advocacy social media network, the Washington University HHT Center of Excellence, and a randomized clinical trial investigating an intranasal timolol gel for HHT-associated epistaxis. Face and content validity, factor analysis, internal consistency as measured through Cronbach α, construct validity, responsiveness to change, and minimal clinically important difference. The NOSE HHT was developed and validated with a possible score ranging discretely from 0 to 4 for each of the 29 items and a total score ranging continuously from 0 to 4 after dividing by the total number of items answered. A total of 401 participants completed the NOSE HHT. Factor analysis identified 3 factors that matched the a priori specified subgroups of particular aspects of life affected by HHT-associated epistaxis: physical problems (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.59 [0.83]), functional limitations (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.28 [0.84]), and emotional consequences (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.95 [1.02]). The instrument had high internal consistency with an overall Cronbach α of 0.960. Convergent validity determined the total NOSE HHT score to be a strong predictor of disease severity; total NOSE HHT score can be split up into the following epistaxis severity categories: mild (0-1), moderate (1.01-2), and severe (>2). The instrument was found to be sensitive to change, and the minimal clinically important difference for the total NOSE HHT score was 0.46. Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

33081831	"Dietary iron intake and anemia: food frequency questionnaire in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular disease characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and prognosis. Dietary evaluation is relevant in HHT patients to provide adequate iron and nutrient intake. Additionally, different dietary items have been reported to precipitate epistaxis in this setting. **Our primary aim was to investigate the dietary habits of HHT patients through a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate the presence of precipitants and/or protective factors for epistaxis and the occurrence of possible dietary modifications. The secondary aims were to evaluate the nutritional intake of iron in HHT patients and the self-reported effect of iron treatments on epistaxis**. From April 2018 to October 2018, a 138-item FFQ was provided to HHT patients followed up at the HHT Referral Center of Crema Maggiore Hospital. The relationship between food items and epistaxis was ascertained on a separate form. Daily iron intake was calculated to establish the mean iron content of food items reported in the FFQ. One hundred forty-nine questionnaires were evaluated [72 females, median age 54 years (12-76). Overall, 26 (18%) patients reported dietary items that improved epistaxis (mostly blueberries and red fruits, green vegetables and legumes), while 38 (26%) reported some dietary items that exacerbated epistaxis (spices, chocolate, alcohol, strawberries and ginger). Dietary modifications were reported in up to 58% of cases. In HHT patients, the mean daily iron intake was 8.46 ± 2.78 mg, and no differences were observed in the iron intake of patients reporting a diet modification and those who did not. In the comprehensive management of HHT a healthy and balanced diet, with increased consumption of dietary items with a high iron content, should be encouraged.

33147670	"Asymptomatic disseminated telangiectasias: a rare case of cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy
"	"Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare idiopathic microangiopathy affecting superficial dermal blood vessels. It is characterized by asymptomatic, disseminated, telangiectatic macules that typically involve the extremities. We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with widespread telangiectasias of three years' duration on the upper extremities and abdomen. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy may be underdiagnosed as it is often mistaken for disorders that are morphologically very similar, including generalized essential telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis. **The diagnosis of CCV is made histologically and findings feature dilated superficial dermal vessels with thickened walls containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive eosinophilic hyaline material.** Effective treatment options for CCV have yet to be established and given its benign disease course, treatment may not be necessary. Pulsed dye laser can be offered to patients for cosmetic improvement but the extent of the disease makes complete lesion clearance challenging in most cases. Given the lesions were asymptomatic our patient declined all offered treatment modalities.

33211216	"Oral itraconazole for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a proof of concept study
"	"The inhibiting effects of itraconazole, an antifungal drug on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have recently been discovered. By inhibiting VEGF, itraconazole has shown potential in clinical trials as anti-cancer treatment. In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients, VEGF levels are elevated and inhibition of VEGF can decrease bleeding.** Itraconazole could potentially serve as anti-angiogenic therapy for HHT-related bleeding. We report a proof of concept study with HHT patients and severe epistaxis. Patients were treated with daily 200 mg orally administered itraconazole for sixteen weeks.** Twenty-one HHT patients, 8 females (38%), 13 males (62%), median age of 59 years (interquartile range (IQR) 55-69) were enrolled. Of these patients, 13 (62%) were diagnosed with HHT type 1, seven (33%) with HHT type 2 and in one patient (5%), no pathognomonic HHT mutation was found. Four patients (19%) prematurely terminated the study (3 due to mild or moderate side-effects) resulting in 17 patients included in the analyses. The median epistaxis severity score significantly decreased during treatment from 6.0 (IQR 5.1-7.2) to 3.8 (IQR 3.1-5.2) (p = 0.006). The monthly epistaxis frequency decreased from 56 to 38 epistaxis episodes (p = 0.004) and the monthly duration from 407 to 278 minutes (p = 0.005). Hemoglobin levels did not significantly change. The quality of life showed a small but significant improvement. **In conclusion, oral itraconazole significantly improved epistaxis in HHT patients. The potential benefit of itraconazole in HHT should be further investigated.**

33242965	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation managed by VATS lobectomy
"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is formed by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins that bypass the pulmonary capillaries and transport deoxygenated blood through pulmonary veins to the left heart. This causes insufficient oxygenation of blood in the lungs. This condition remains symptomless for a long period of time. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, nosebleeds, increased fatigue and a gradual development of cyanosis. Paradoxical embolism in the brain is a serious complication; it can present with a stroke or a brain abscess. Treatment of the disease consists of embolization of the pathological vascular connections, surgical resection of the affected pulmonary parenchyma and management of concomitant manifestations of the disease. PAVM in most common cases arises as a result of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder referred to as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Case report: In our communication, we document the diagnostic and therapeutic management in a young patient diagnosed with PAVM after falling off his bicycle. Based on comprehensive assessments, AV malformations with a 40% shunt of the pulmonary circulation were detected. An angiographic procedure was not an appropriate option considering the type and extent of the condition. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic resection of the affected pulmonary lobe was indicated. Conclusion: PAVM is a rare finding. PAVM should be ruled out in all patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) signs in the oral cavity. Contrast sonography of the heart and contract CT of the chest are the methods of choice for the diagnosis. Conservative or pharmacological treat-ment fails to improve the patients status.  The condition is usually managed by embolization. Cases where PAVM is rather extensive or diffuse, where endovascular management would be inappropriate, can be well managed using endoscopic resection adequate to the extent of the condition.

33243256	"High output cardiac failure in 3 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and hepatic vascular malformations, evaluation of treatment
"	"This report addresses how patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and high output cardiac failure (HOCF) due to hepatic vascular malformations, should be evaluated and could be treated. HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. **Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. **All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.

33282178	"Autologous correction in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-endothelial cells to identify a novel pathogenic mutation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.

33498134	"Novel Protein Interactions with Endoglin and Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1: Potential Role in Vascular Networks.
"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder that presents with recurrent, intractable epistaxis. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of various treatment options for epistaxis in patients with HHT, over a period of 18 years, and to correlate these findings with available evidence in the literature. Records of patients with HHT, treated for epistaxis between 2000 and 2018 were analyzed. Treatment procedures carried out and their efficacy were extracted and analyzed. Forty-three records were evaluated. All patients were given nasal humidifying ointments, 93% required acute treatment with bipolar electrocautery, and 60% underwent atraumatic nasal packing. Recurrent cases were treated medically with tranexamic acid (26%), oestrogen (19%), and bevacizumab (2%). Laser photocoagulation was done in selected cases (40%) and if unsuccessful, septal dermoplasty was performed (2.3%). Endovascular embolization was reserved for life-threatening emergencies (7%). Epistaxis in HHT is not curable, but can be managed by employing a comprehensive stepwise approach. An algorithm for effective and comprehensive management has been presented.

33677851	"Genetic variants and clinical phenotypes in Korean patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) and Endoglin (ENG) are the principal genes whose mutations cause HHT. A multicenter study to investigate the correlation between genetic variations and clinical outcomes in Korean HHT patients has been lacking. **Seventy-two members from 40 families suspected of HHT based on symptoms were genetically screened for pathogenic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG.** Patients with genetically diagnosed HHT were also evaluated. In the HHT genetic screening, 42 patients from 24 of the 40 families had genetic variants that met the pathogenic criteria (pathogenic very strong, pathogenic strong, pathogenic moderate, or pathogenic supporting) based on ACMG Standards and Guidelines in either EN**G or ACVRL1; 26 from 12 families (50%) in ENG, and 16 from 12 families (50%) in ACVRL1.** The diagnostic screening of 42 genetically positive HHT patients based on the Curaçao criteria revealed that 24 patients (57%) were in the definite group, 17 patients (41%) were in the probable group, and 1 patient (2%) was in the unlikely group. Epistaxis was the most common clinical presentation (38/42, 90%), followed by visceral AVMs (24/42, 57%), and telangiectasia (21/42, 50%). Five patients (12%) did not have a family history of HHT clinical symptoms. Among patients having ACVRL1 or ENG genetic variants, only about half of them could be clinically diagnosed as definite HHT, suggesting that genetic screening is important to confirm the diagnosis.

Transcutaneous oxygen saturation reached 98% without oxygen inhalation on the day after surgery.** Pulmonary angiography at 3 months after surgery showed the recurrence of pulmonary vascular malformation, and embolization of pulmonary arterial fistula was not performed since the guide wire could not enter the branch artery. There was still a need for long-term follow-up.
