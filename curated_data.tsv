3176552	"Genotype and phenotype evaluation of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: First results from Turkey
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease and the severity of the disease related with genetic analysis has been described in some previous studies. The main aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with genetically diagnosed PCD and to investigate the correlation between clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings and genetic analyses of these patients. This is a cohort study in which we analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and genetic results of 46 patients with genetically diagnosed PCD through whole-exome sequencing at our single center from a total of 265 patients with PCD within a 5-year period. Genetic analysis revealed pathogenic variants in DNAH5 (n = 12 individuals, 12 families), CCDC40 (n = 9 individuals, six families), RSPH4A (n = 5 individuals, three families), DNAH11 (n = 4 individuals, four families), HYDIN (n = 5 individuals, five families), CCNO (n = 4 individuals, four families), DNAI1 (n = 2 individuals, one family), ARMC4 (n = 2 individuals, two families), TTC25 (n = 1), DNAH1 (n = 1), and CCDC39 (n = 1) genes. Although not statistically significant, the age at diagnosis was lower (median: 3 years; range, 6 months-4 years) in patients with CCNO pathogenic variants due to the early reporting of symptoms, and the median body mass index (BMI) and BMI z scores were lower in patients at 18.7 and 16 kg/m2 , and -0.78 and -1.2 with CCDC40 and CCNO pathogenic variants, respectively. The median forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75% were 53%, 64%, and 28%, respectively; these parameters were also lower in the CCDC40 group than in the other groups. There was no significant correlation between the genetic results and symptoms, radiologic findings, and microbiologic data of patients with PCD. In PCD, there was significant heterogeneity of lung disease, patients who had pathogenic variants in CCNO presented earlier, and those with CCDC40 and CCNO had worse lung disease, and poorer nutritional status compared with the other subgroups. We hope that whole genotype-phenotype and clinical relationships will be identified in PCD.

19675306	"Conditional deletion of dnaic1 in a murine model of primary ciliary dyskinesia causes chronic rhinosinusitis
"	"Studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model because disruption of essential ciliary genes in mice results in a high incidence of lethal hydrocephalus. To develop a viable mouse model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1, are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA, and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6 months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD.

19840971	"A 20-year experience of electron microscopy in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of ciliary ultrastructure is classically used for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We report our extensive experience of TEM analysis in a large series of patients in order to evaluate its feasibility and results. TEM analysis performed in 1,149 patients with suspected PCD was retrospectively reviewed. Biopsies (1,450) were obtained from nasal (44%) or bronchial (56%) mucosa in children (66.5%) and adults (33.5%). TEM analysis was feasible in 71.4% of patients and showed a main defect suggestive of PCD in 29.9%. TEM was more feasible in adults than in children, regardless of the biopsy site. Main defects suggestive of PCD were found in 76.9% of patients with sinopulmonary symptoms and in only 0.4% of patients with isolated upper and 0.4% with isolated lower respiratory tract infections. The defect pattern was similar in children and adults, involving dynein arms (81.2%) or central complex (CC) (18.8%). Situs inversus was never observed in PCD patients with CC defect. Kartagener syndrome with normal ciliary ultrastructure was not an exceptional condition (10.2% of PCD). In conclusion, TEM analysis is feasible in most patients and is particularly useful for PCD diagnosis in cases of sinopulmonary syndrome of unknown origin.

19924426	"Automated software for analysis of ciliary beat frequency and metachronal wave orientation in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have structural and/or functional alterations of cilia that imply deficits in mucociliary clearance and different respiratory pathologies. A useful indicator for the difficult diagnosis is the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) that is significantly lower in pathological cases than in physiological ones. The CBF computation is not rapid, therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an automated method to evaluate it directly from videos of ciliated cells. The cells are taken from inferior nasal turbinates and videos of ciliary movements are registered and eventually processed by the developed software. The software consists in the extraction of features from videos (written with C++ language) and the computation of the frequency (written with Matlab language). This system was tested both on the samples of nasal cavity and software models, and the results were really promising because in a few seconds, it can compute a reliable frequency if compared with that measured with visual methods. It is to be noticed that the reliability of the computation increases with the quality of acquisition system and especially with the sampling frequency. It is concluded that the developed software could be a useful mean for PCD diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital autosomal recessive disease that produces impairment of mucosal ciliary movement. Children with this disorder usually manifest recurrent and chronic infections of the upper and lower airways. We describe the history of a 12-month-old boy in whom the correct diagnosis of PCD was achieved after the occurrence of ethmoid mucocele associated with omolateral proptosis. A careful description of this new feature of PCD and its dangerous complications are also presented.

20097527	"Ventricular rotation is independent of cardiac looping: a study in mice with situs inversus totalis using speckle-tracking echocardiography
"	"The authors conducted an ultrasound interrogation of a mutant mouse model with a Dnah5 mutation to determine whether cardiac mechanics may be affected by reversal of cardiac situs. This mutant is a bona fide model of primary ciliary dyskinesia, with surviving homozygous mice showing either situs solitus (SS) or situs inversus totalis (SI). High-frequency ultrasound interrogations of 27 neonatal and infant Dnah5 mutant mice, 16 with SS and 11 with SI, were conducted using an ultra-high-frequency biomicroscope. Electrocardiographic and respiratory gating were used to reconstruct high-resolution two-dimensional cines at 1,000 Hz, with speckle-tracking echocardiography used to further analyze midchamber and apical rotation. All SS mice exhibited the expected counterclockwise apical rotation as viewed caudocranially, and surprisingly, the same counterclockwise motion was also observed in SI mice. Speckle-tracking analysis confirmed counterclockwise systolic rotation in both SS and SI mice, and this increased in magnitude from the subepicardium to the endocardium and from the papillary muscles to the apex. The magnitude of apical endocardial rotation was not different for SS and SI mice (5.64+/-0.75 degrees and 5.76+/-1.90 degrees, respectively, P=.93). The anatomic segments responsible for the largest components of apical endocardial systolic rotation differed between the SS and SI hearts (P=.004). In both, the two largest contributors to rotation were offset 180 degrees from each other, but the anatomic regions differed between them. In SS hearts, maximal regional rotation occurred at the anterior mid-septum and posterolateral free wall, while in SI hearts, it was derived from the posterior septum and the anterolateral free wall. Analysis by episcopic fluorescence image capture histology of representative SI and SS mice showed normal intracardiac and segmental anatomy ({S,D,S} or {I,L,I}) without intracardiac defects. These results show that mirror-image cardiac looping did not result in mirror-image rotation of the morphologic left ventricle. These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether fiber orientation and cardiac mechanics may be abnormal in individuals with reversal of cardiac situs. The results of this study indicate that cardiac looping and myofiber orientation may be independently regulated.

20106870	"Deletion of the Parkin co-regulated gene causes defects in ependymal ciliary motility and hydrocephalus in the quakingviable mutant mouse
"	"The quakingviable mouse (qkv) is a spontaneous recessive mouse mutant with a deletion of approximately 1.1 Mb in the proximal region of chromosome 17. The deletion affects the expression of three genes; quaking (Qk), Parkin-coregulated gene (Pacrg) and parkin (Park2). The resulting phenotype, which includes dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression, respectively. Pacrg is required for correct development of the spermatozoan flagella, a specialized type of motile cilia. In vertebrates, motile cilia are required for multiple functions related to cellular movement or movement of media over a stationary cell surface. To investigate the potential role of PACRG in motile cilia we analysed qkv mutant mice for evidence of cilial dysfunction. Histological and magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated that qkv mutant mice were affected by acquired, communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structural analysis of ependymal cilia demonstrated that the 9 + 2 arrangement of axonemal microtubules was intact and that both the density of ciliated cells and cilia length was similar to wild-type littermates. Cilia function studies showed a reduction in ependymal cilial beat frequency and cilial mediated flow in qkv mutant mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Moreover, transgenic expression of Pacrg was necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC phenotype in the qkv mutant. This study provides novel in vivo evidence that Pacrg is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia and primary ciliary dyskinesia.

20167855	"Lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a cross-sectional and 3-decade longitudinal study
"	"Early diagnosis and treatment is considered important to prevent lung damage in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Few studies have addressed long-term evolution of lung function after PCD diagnosis. We investigated whether long-term lung function was dependent on age or level of lung function at PCD diagnosis. An observational, single-center, cross-sectional, and three-decade longitudinal study of FEV(1) and FVC related to age at diagnosis until current age was performed. Linear regression was used to describe the relation between first measured lung function values and age at diagnosis across the cohort. Courses of lung function after diagnosis and the according slopes were used to group patients into increasing, stable, or decreasing courses. Additionally, slopes from courses of 10 years of follow-up were related to age at diagnosis and initial level of lung function, respectively, using linear regression. Seventy-four children and adults with PCD were observed for median 9.5 (range, 1.5-30.2) years during which 2,937 lung function measurements were performed. First measured FEV(1) was less than 80% of predicted in one-third of preschool-diagnosed children. During observation, 34% of patients lost more than 10 percentage points, 57% were stable, and 10% improved more than 10 percentage points in FEV(1). Courses of lung function after diagnosis were related to neither age at diagnosis nor initial level. Our study strongly suggests that PCD is a disease of serious threat to lung function already at preschool age, and with a high degree of variation in courses of lung function after diagnosis that was not linked to either age or level of lung function at diagnosis. Early diagnosis did not protect against decline in lung function.

20220176	"Analysis of genetic inheritance in a family quartet by whole-genome sequencing
"	"We analyzed the whole-genome sequences of a family of four, consisting of two siblings and their parents. Family-based sequencing allowed us to delineate recombination sites precisely, identify 70% of the sequencing errors (resulting in > 99.999% accuracy), and identify very rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We also directly estimated a human intergeneration mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome, for which the gene was concurrently identified, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes have been previously identified. Family-based genome analysis enabled us to narrow the candidate genes for both of these Mendelian disorders to only four. Our results demonstrate the value of complete genome sequencing in families.

20335083	"Value of nasal nitric oxide in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"The aim of this study is to report nasal nitric oxide (nNO) values in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and to compare them with nNO values in healthy children, asthmatic children, children with cystic fibrosis and children with post infectious bronchiectasis. We determined nNO values in 9 children with PCD, 36 asthmatic children, 31 children with cystic fibrosis, 8 children with post infectious bronchiectasis and 37 healthy children. We compared nNO values between these different conditions and calculated sensitivity and specificity of nNO to diagnose PCD. All children with PCD - except one (nNO 348 ppb) - had nNO values below 112 ppb, mean 88 ppb (95%CI 9.6-166). The nNO mean was 898 ppb (95%CI 801-995) in healthy children, 1023 ppb (95%CI 911-1137) in asthmatic children, 438 ppb (95%CI 367-508) in cystic fibrosis children and 361 ppb (95%CI 252-470) in children with post infectious bronchiectasis. The mean concentration of nNO was lower (P<0.05) in PCD patients, compared to the other groups. The measurement of nasal NO in our study population showed, at a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb, a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 99.1% in the diagnosis of PCD [ROC 0.98 (95%CI 0.94-0.99); P<0.0001; probability ratio 95.1]. The measurement of nasal NO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD, in which a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb suggests the disease, although nNO above 112 ppb does not exclude PCD.

20421426	"Pcdp1 is a central apparatus protein that binds Ca(2+)-calmodulin and regulates ciliary motility
"	"For all motile eukaryotic cilia and flagella, beating is regulated by changes in intraciliary calcium concentration. Although the mechanism for calcium regulation is not understood, numerous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is a key axonemal calcium sensor. Using anti-CaM antibodies and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii axonemal extracts, we precipitated a complex that includes four polypeptides and that specifically interacts with CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. One of the complex members, FAP221, is an orthologue of mammalian Pcdp1 (primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1). Both FAP221 and mammalian Pcdp1 specifically bind CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. Reduced expression of Pcdp1 complex members in C. reinhardtii results in failure of the C1d central pair projection to assemble and significant impairment of motility including uncoordinated bends, severely reduced beat frequency, and altered waveforms. These combined results reveal that the central pair Pcdp1 (FAP221) complex is essential for control of ciliary motility.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary disorder of mucociliary clearance causing chronic upper and lower airways disease. We determined the number of patients with diagnosed PCD across Europe, described age at diagnosis and determined risk factors for late diagnosis. Centres treating children with PCD in Europe answered questionnaires and provided anonymous patient lists. In total, 223 centres from 26 countries reported 1,009 patients aged < 20 yrs. Reported cases per million children (for 5-14 yr olds) were highest in Cyprus (111), Switzerland (47) and Denmark (46). Overall, 57% were males and 48% had situs inversus. Median age at diagnosis was 5.3 yrs, lower in children with situs inversus (3.5 versus 5.8 yrs; p < 0.001) and in children treated in large centres (4.1 versus 4.8 yrs; p = 0.002). Adjusted age at diagnosis was 5.0 yrs in Western Europe, 4.8 yrs in the British Isles, 5.5 yrs in Northern Europe, 6.8 yrs in Eastern Europe and 6.5 yrs in Southern Europe (p < 0.001). This strongly correlated with general government expenditures on health (p < 0.001). This European survey suggests that PCD in children is under-diagnosed and diagnosed late, particularly in countries with low health expenditures. Prospective studies should assess the impact this delay might have on patient prognosis and on health economic costs across Europe.

20537283	"Role of adenylate kinase type 7 expression on cilia motility: possible link in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) mediates the reaction 2ADP <--> ATP + AMP, providing energy for the beating of cilia. A study recently showed that AK7 expression may be correlated with the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) phenotype in mice. In this study, we characterized AK7 expression in vitro in an air-liquid interface (ALI) model and in middle nasal turbinate biopsy specimens from a cohort of patients with PCD to elucidate whether AK7 expression is correlated with ciliary malfunction. AK7 expression was measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. In vitro differentiated nasal human epithelial cell siRNA experiments were performed to investigate the effect of AK7 expression on ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Ciliary motility and ultrastructure were evaluated in a cohort of 29 patients with PCD (PCD, n = 17; Kartagener's syndrome, n = 12) and 26 healthy control donors. AK7 expression was mainly located on the apical surface of differentiated nasal ALI cells, and targeted suppression of the AK7 gene decreased CBF by 41%. AK7 expression was diminished significantly in patients with PCD (0.54 +/- 0.1-fold; p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls (1.1 +/- 0.08-fold). Furthermore, AK7 expression was correlated with CBF in patients with PCD (r = 0.5; p = 0.009). AK7 expression was correlated with CBF in vitro and in nasal biopsy specimens from patients with PCD, which may have contributed to the ciliary malfunction observed in our patients with PCD.

Recent linkage and mutational analyses identified several genes that are responsible for Kartagener syndrome. Most of them encode subunits of axonemal dyneins, highlighting the importance of dynein motors to ciliary motility. Recent data indicate that defects in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport are involved in the etiology of ALS. Genes encoding the dynein heavy chain of cytoplasmic and outer arm axonemal dyneins are reported to have similar sequences in their central and 3'-end regions. Although a causal link between ALS and Kartagener syndrome has not yet been definitely established, the precise relationship between disrupted axonemal dynein function in Kartagener syndrome and motor neuron death should be investigated.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that produces lifelong difficulties with chronic airway inflammation. Little is known about the role of chronic airway inflammation on chloride ion transport properties in PCD. This study assessed the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride (Cl) ion transport properties of freshly excised nasal mucosa from PCD compared with normal and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Electrophysiology study utilizing Ussing type hemi-chamber technique with three different types of nasal tissue (normal, CRS, PCD) obtained from patients during endoscopic surgery at a tertiary referral center. Nasal tissues were examined under short-circuit conditions, and gradient-driven Cl currents were continuously recorded. The cAMP elevating agonist (forskolin) was added to stimulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl secretion. To prevent misinterpretation of flux measurement, Cl transport inhibitors were used at the end of all experiments. Basal Cl currents (I(Cl)) and changes in I(Cl) to forskolin (DeltaI(Cl)) were compared between normal, CRS, and PCD nasal tissues. Forskolin stimulated Cl currents across all different types of nasal epithelia. The Cl secretory response was effectively blocked by the Cl ion transport inhibitors. I(Cl) were significantly higher in normals (155.0 +/- 9.3 microA/cm(2)) compared to CRS (79.1 +/- 15.0 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (70.9 +/- 20.4 microA/cm(2)) (P = .005). DeltaI(Cl) in CRS (14.8 +/- 2.3 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (12.2 +/- 2.4 microA/cm(2)) were markedly diminished compared to normals (28.3 +/- 4.7 microA/cm(2)) (P = .024). PCD tissues were characterized by impaired I(Cl) and DeltaI(Cl). Both parameters were reduced by 54.3% and 56.9% in PCD when compared to normals.

"	"Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles released during cell activation and apoptosis. MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a+-and CD66b+-, but not CD11b+-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.

"	"Agenesis of paranasal sinuses has only been described in case reports of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). As agenesis of paranasal sinuses may contribute to low nasal nitric oxide levels, a common finding in PCD, we speculated that this condition might frequently occur in PCD patients. Patients referred for PCD evaluation were consecutively recruited for 30 months. In addition to standard diagnostic testing for PCD, a computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses was performed in all subjects. 86 patients (46 children aged 8-17 yrs) were studied. PCD was diagnosed in 41 subjects and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) was diagnosed in the remaining 45 subjects. Frontal and/or sphenoidal sinuses were either aplastic or hypoplastic on CT scans in 30 (73%) out of 41 PCD patients, but in only 17 (38%) out of 45 with SCD (p = 0.002). There was a significant inverse correlation between the score for aplasia/hypoplasia of each paranasal sinus and nasal NO values in the PCD patients (p = 0.008, r = -0.432) but not in SCD (p = 0.07, r = -0.271). The findings of aplasia/hypoplasia of the frontal and or sphenoidal sinuses may be part of the spectrum of PCD and this finding should prompt exclusion of this condition.

20682136	"Nasal nitric oxide and pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance as supplementary tools in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by abnormalities in ciliary structure and/or function. Frequent, intermittent or chronic airway infections precipitated by impaired airway mucociliary clearance may cause permanent lung damage and reduced lung function. Early diagnosis is considered important for the prevention of lung damage, but diagnosis is probably often delayed or even missed since diagnosis of PCD is both complex and time consuming, and yet not always exact. The aims of this PhD thesis were to evaluate the discriminative capacity and ""real-life"" clinical application of two candidates for supplemental diagnostic testing for PCD: Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement placed as a first line test to point out probable PCD patients for further investigation or exclude patients, regardless of age, Pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance (PRMC) as a second line test for PCD investigation in children from 5 years of age. And additionally, Proposing an algorithm for the pathway of diagnosing PCD based on these two studies and recommendations from the literature. Nasal NO and PRMC demonstrated to be two highly valid supplementary diagnostic tools to be placed in each end of the diagnostic pathway when investigating selected patients referred for PCD work up. Nasal NO measurement demonstrated to have an obvious place as a first line test in the pathway of PCD investigation and PRMC as second line test as a supplement to ciliary function test and EM-test in cases of difficult diagnoses. Neither of these tests can stand alone in diagnosis or excluding of PCD. PCD remains to be a diagnosis that should be made at a tertiary PCD centre, as clinical evaluation of referred patients is crucial before excluding the disease.

"	"Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles that have diverse motility and sensory functions. Motility defects in cilia and flagella result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We isolated a novel medaka PCD mutant, jaodori (joi). Positional cloning showed that axonemal dynein intermediate chain 2 (dnai2) is responsible for joi. The joi mutation was caused by genomic insertion of the medaka transposon, Tol1. In the joi mutant, cilia in Kupffer's vesicle (KV), an organ functionally equivalent to the mouse node in terms of left-right (LR) specification, are generated but their motility is disrupted, resulting in a LR defect. Ultrastructural analysis revealed severe reduction in the outer dynein arms in KV cilia of joi mutants. We also found the other dnai2 gene in the medaka genome. These two dnai2 genes function either redundantly or distinctly in tissues possessing motile cilia.

"	"Previous studies have reported differences in muscle function and metabolism between patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls (HC), but it is currently unknown whether these abnormalities are specific to CF or also seen in other airway diseases. In this study, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during exercise to assess muscle metabolism in CF patients. Twenty patients with CF and 20 age, gender, and habitual activity-matched HCs and a respiratory disease comparison group with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; n = 10) were studied. Phosphorus MRS (P-MRS) was used to characterize muscle bioenergetic metabolism at rest and after high-, moderate-, and low-intensity exercise. CF patients exhibited lower resting ATP/phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio and significantly higher end-exercise pH values compared with both HC and PCD patients. Both CF and PCD patients demonstrated significantly slower PCr recovery time constants after high-intensity exercise. Our results suggest that not only there are specific abnormalities of muscle metabolism in CF patients but also there is a nonspecific impact of respiratory disease on muscle function.

"	"The evaluation of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) has been proposed as a screening tool in children with clinically suspectable primary ciliary dyskinesia. Nevertheless, normal values have been reported for school-aged children. This study was designed to identify normal nNO levels in pre-school children. nNO was assessed in 300 healthy children aged between 1.5 and 7.2. Two hundred and fifty of them were unable to fulfill the guideline requirements for nNO measurement and were assessed by sampling the nasal air continuously with a constant trans-nasal aspiration flow for 30 s during tidal breathing. For those children who were able to cooperate, the average nNO concentration was calculated according to guidelines. A statistically significant relationship between nNO level and age was demonstrated in this study group of pre-school children (p < 0.001). An increase in nNO of about 100 ppb was observed in children older than 6 yr vs. those aged < 3. This study presents a description of normal nNO values in pre-school children. The effect of the age and the eventual presence of rhinitis and snoring need to be considered whenever nNO is evaluated in the clinical practice, in particular in non-cooperative children.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, reduced fertility in males and situs inversus in about 50% of affected individuals (Kartagener syndrome). It is caused by motility defects in the respiratory cilia that are responsible for airway clearance, the flagella that propel sperm cells and the nodal monocilia that determine left-right asymmetry. Recessive mutations that cause PCD have been identified in genes encoding components of the outer dynein arms, radial spokes and cytoplasmic pre-assembly factors of axonemal dyneins, but these mutations account for only about 50% of cases of PCD. We exploited the unique properties of dog populations to positionally clone a new PCD gene, CCDC39. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the human ortholog underlie a substantial fraction of PCD cases with axonemal disorganization and abnormal ciliary beating. Functional analyses indicated that CCDC39 localizes to ciliary axonemes and is essential for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex.

"	"To determine the efficacy of our nasal brush biopsy technique to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia. Retrospective chart review at an urban children's hospital. We obtained medical records of all patients who underwent an endoscopic guided ciliary brush biopsy from January 2000 to June 2008. Data recorded included the procedure date, biopsy location, presence of motility on light microscopy, and whether specimen was sent for electron microscopy and those results. Sixty pediatric patients between the ages of 16 months and 17.3 years with chronic sinusitis (35 males, 25 females) were identified. Three were excluded because biopsies were taken from a non nasal location. Forty-seven specimens had light microscopy evaluation only, as normal motile cilia were identified. Ten had haphazard or absent motility and required further evaluation with electron microscopy. Electron microscopy ruled out defects for three samples, was non-diagnostic for five, and the remaining two reports could not be found. Overall, in 47/57 (82%) cases, light microscopy alone ruled out primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Using both methods, there was a 91% success rate in ruling out PCD. Obtaining an endoscopic biopsy with a cytosoft cytology brush (Camarillo California) from the posterior portion of the inferior turbinate gave sufficient specimen to examine for PCD. Light microscopy alone or in concert with evaluation by electron microscopy confirmed normal cilia in 91% of specimens ruling out the diagnosis of PCD. The algorithm suggested is simple and has high success in allowing the clinician to exclude the diagnosis of PCD in the patient with chronic or recurrent upper respiratory infections.

Gene expression of endothelial (NOS3) and inducible NOS (NOS2) and their correlation with nNO level, ciliary function and morphology were studied in patients with PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). NOS3 gene polymorphisms were studied in blood leukocytes. A total of 212 subjects were studied (48 with PCD, 161 with SCD and three normal subjects). nNO level correlated with mean ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.044; r = 0.174). The lower the nNO level the higher was the percentage of immotile cilia (p<0.001; r = -0.375). A significant positive correlation between NOS2 gene expression and nNO levels was demonstrated in all children (p = 0.001; r = 0.428), and this correlation was confirmed in patients with PCD (p = 0.019; r = 0.484). NOS2 gene expression was lower in PCD than in SCD (p = 0.04). The NOS3 isoform correlated with missing central microtubules (p = 0.048; r = 0.447). nNO levels were higher in PCD subjects with the NOS3 thymidine 894 mutation, and this was associated with a higher ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.045). These results demonstrate a relationship between nNO level, NOS mRNA expression and ciliary beat frequency.

"	"Examination of ciliary ultrastructure remains the cornerstone diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of abnormal ciliary structure and/or function. Obtaining a biopsy with sufficient interpretable cilia and producing quality transmission electron micrographs (TEM) is challenging. Methods for processing tissues for optimal preservation of axonemal structures are not standardized. This study describes our experience using a standard operating procedure (SOP) for collecting nasal scrape biopsies and processing TEMs in a centralized laboratory. We enrolled patients with suspected PCD at research sites of the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium. Biopsies were performed according to a SOP whereby curettes were used to scrape the inferior surface of the inferior turbinate, with samples placed in fixative. Specimens were shipped to a central laboratory where TEMs were prepared and blindly reviewed. Four hundred forty-eight specimens were obtained from 107 young children (0-5 years), 189 older children (5-18 years), and 152 adults (> 18 years), and 88% were adequate for formal interpretation. The proportion of adequate specimens was higher in adults than in children. Fifty percent of the adequate TEMs showed normal ciliary ultrastructure, 39% showed hallmark ultrastructural changes of PCD, and 11% had indeterminate findings. Among specimens without clearly normal ultrastructure, 72% had defects of the outer and/or inner dynein arms (IDA), while 7% had central apparatus defects with or without IDA defects. In summary, nasal scrape biopsies can be performed in the outpatient setting and yield interpretable samples, when performed by individuals with adequate training and experience according to an SOP.

On repeat testing, five patients initially suspected of an inner dynein arm defect and one with a radial spoke defect had normal EM and beat pattern, leading to the initial diagnosis being questioned.

"	"Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is assessed by nasal aspiration/insufflation via one nostril or by nasal silent exhalation through a facemask and is also measured during humming, a manoeuvre that results in increased nNO in the presence of a patent osteomeatal complex. Humming nNO peak is absent in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hand-held devices are used successfully for exhaled or nNO analysis. No study compared nNO during silent and humming exhalation using hand-held and stationary analysers. Thirty-eight subjects (14 PCD; 11 CF; 13 healthy individuals) measured nNO with a stationary and a hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalations. No difference between nNO obtained from stationary or hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalation was found (P > 0·05). Patients with PCD exhibited lower silent and humming nNO than CF or controls (P < 0·001). During both silent and humming exhalation, there was a significant correlation between nNO from the two analyzers both in the whole study population and within each group (r ≥ 0·7, P < 0·01). Bland-Altman plots confirmed this agreement. Using the hand-held device during humming, nNO values of 50, 81 and 21 ppb had sensitivity and specificity > 90% for discriminating PCD or CF from healthy subjects, and patients with PCD from patients with CF, respectively. The hand-held device is as effective as the stationary analyzer for assessing nNO during silent and humming exhalation. Its wider use might result in an increased number of subjects suspected to have PCD.

"	"Recently, it has been suggested that misprojections of the temporal retina to the contralateral hemisphere might not be specific for patients with albinism and might also be associated with the Kartagener syndrome (i.e., with situs inversus totalis in the presence of primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). The authors tested whether such projection abnormalities are associated with PCD and situs inversus. In 10 patients with PCD (five with situs inversus totalis) and in 10 age- and sex-matched controls, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded monocularly, as follows: conventional pattern-onset VEPs (cVEPs) and multifocal VEPs (mfVEPs) for 60 locations constituting a visual field of 44° diameter. cVEPs from 13 albinotic subjects were included as a reference. For each eye, interhemispheric difference potentials were calculated and correlated with each other to assess the lateralization of the responses: positive and negative correlation coefficients indicated lateralizations on same or opposite hemispheres, respectively. Misrouted optic nerves are expected to yield negative interocular correlations. For both cVEPs and mfVEPs, the distribution of the correlation coefficients in the PCD patients yielded largely positive values and did not differ from that of the controls. Consequently, neither large- nor small-scale lateralization abnormalities were observed in PCD. Further, the optic nerve projection did not depend on the presence of situs inversus. The absence of evidence for projection abnormalities in a cohort of 10 subjects with PCD, five of whom had Kartagener syndrome, underscores that misrouting of the optic nerves is not a common trait of these subjects.

"	"Nitric oxide is believed to play a central role in nonspecific defense of upper airways. Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have very low concentration of nasal nitric oxide, which may contribute to the chronic upper airway diseases encountered by these patients. The mechanisms underlying this drop of nasal nitric oxide in primary ciliary dyskinesia are still unknown. The goal of the present work was to study nitric oxide synthases expression in upper airway tissues from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. For this purpose, 5 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and 10 nonallergic age-matched patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia undergoing nasal polypectomy were included. Nasal nitric oxide concentration was measured before polypectomy, and nitric oxide synthase expression and function were studied in nasal polyps. The nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia was lower than that in patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia (13 [9-16] ppb versus 210 [167-254] ppb, P < .0001). Nitric oxide synthase 2 immunostaining was prominent at the apical part of the ciliated epithelial cells and was similar in both groups. Nitric oxide synthase 3 staining was restricted to endothelial cells in both groups. In addition, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase activity was superimposable to nitric oxide synthases 2 and 3 immunostaining, suggesting a preserved NADPH-activity of nitric oxide synthase. We therefore conclude that the drop in nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia is not secondary to the loss of nitric oxide synthase expression.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) results from defects in motile cilia function. Mice homozygous for the mutation big giant head (bgh) have several abnormalities commonly associated with PCD, including hydrocephalus, male infertility, and sinusitis. In the present study, we use a variety of histopathological and cell biological techniques to characterize the bgh phenotype, and we identify the bgh mutation using a positional cloning approach. Histopathological, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic analyses demonstrate that the male infertility results from shortened flagella and disorganized axonemal and accessory structures in elongating spermatids and mature sperm. In addition, there is a reduced number of elongating spermatids during spermatogenesis and mature sperm in the epididymis. Histological analyses show that the hydrocephalus is characterized by severe dilatation of the lateral ventricles and that bgh sinuses have an accumulation of mucus infiltrated by neutrophils. In contrast to the sperm phenotype, electron microscopy demonstrates that mutant respiratory epithelial cilia are ultrastructurally normal, but video microscopic analysis shows that their beat frequency is lower than that of wild-type cilia. Through a positional cloning approach, we identified two sequence variants in the gene encoding sperm flagellar protein 2 (SPEF2), which has been postulated to play an important role in spermatogenesis and flagellar assembly. A causative nonsense mutation was validated by Western blot analysis, strongly suggesting that the bgh phenotype results from the loss of SPEF2 function. Taken together, the data in this study demonstrate that SPEF2 is required for cilia function and identify a new genetic cause of PCD in mice.

Children with SCD had reference range FE(NO) at 50 mL/sec, but FE(NO) was elevated across all flows compared with healthy control subjects (mean difference=2.10±0.91 parts per billion, P=.03). Subjects with SCD had increased J'aw(NO) (1177±533 picoliters per second versus 833±343 picolitres per second, P=.03), and Ca(NO) was no different from control subjects. In contrast, children with primary ciliary dyskinesia had decreased FE(NO) (mean difference=3.36±1.24 parts per billion, P<.01) and J'aw(NO) (507±259 picoliters per second versus 833±343 picoliters per second, P<.01). Lower airways NO is increased in children with SCD. Elevation of J'aw(NO) may represent dysregulation of NO metabolism or subclinical airways inflammation.

21907944	"Development and validation of a method of cilia motility analysis for the early diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinically uniform entity, but cilia motility and structure can vary between patients, making the diagnostic difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PCD of a system of high-resolution digital high-speed video analysis with proprietary software that we developed for analysis of ciliary motility (Desinsoft-Bio 200). The secondary aim was to correlate nasal ciliary activity with clinical and structural abnormalities in PCD. We analysed nasal mucociliary transport, cilia ultrastructure, nasal ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern studied by high-resolution digital high-speed video in 25 cases of PCD (11 Kartagener syndrome), 27 secondary ciliary dyskinesia and 34 healthy volunteers. Nasal mucociliary transport was defective in both primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Ciliary immotility was observed only in 6 patients with Kartagener syndrome and correlated with the absence of dynein. We observed a correlation between partial dynein deficiencies and ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia activity and structure was normal in secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Nasal mucociliary transport showed high sensitivity for PCD diagnosis with a low specificity. High-resolution digital high-speed video has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PCD. This system of video analysis is more useful than ultrastructural study and mucociliary transport for PCD screening. Dynein absence is correlated with cilia immotility and is more common in patients with Kartagener syndrome.

22006708	"Progression of lung disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia: is spirometry less accurate than CT?
"	"Despite its extensive use, there is no evidence that spirometry is useful in the assessment of progression of lung disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We hypothesize that high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a better indicator of PCD lung disease progression than spirometry. We retrospectively evaluated two paired spirometry and HRCT examinations from 20 PCD patients (age, 11.6 years; range, 6.5-27.5 years). The evaluations were performed in stable state and during unstable lung disease. HRCT scans were scored blind by two raters. Compared to the first assessment, at the second evaluation spirometry did not change while HRCT scores significantly worsened (P < 0.01). Age was significantly related to HRCT total (r = 0.5; P = 0.02) and bronchiectasis scores (r = 0.5; P = 0.02). At both evaluations, HRCT total score correlated with FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.01; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.006; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively), and bronchiectasis score was related to FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.03; r = -0.6; P = 0.002, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.008; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively). No relationship was found between the change in HRCT scores and the change in spirometry. In PCD, structural lung disease may worsen despite spirometry being stable.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder causing significant upper and lower respiratory tract morbidity and impaired fertility. Half of PCD patients show abnormal situs. Human disease loci have been identified but a mouse model without additional deleterious defects is elusive. The inversus viscerum mouse, mutated at the outer arm dynein heavy chain 11 locus (Dnahc11) is a known model of heterotaxy. We demonstrated immotile tracheal cilia with normal ultrastructure and reduced sperm motility in the Dnahc11(iv) mouse. This is accompanied by gross rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis media, all indicators of human PCD. Strikingly, age-related progression of the disease is evident. The Dnahc11(iv) mouse is robust, lacks secondary defects, and requires no intervention to precipitate the phenotype. Together these findings show the Dnahc11(iv) mouse to be an excellent model of many aspects of human PCD. Mutation of the homologous human locus has previously been associated with hyperkinetic tracheal cilia in PCD. Two PCD patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure, one with immotile and one with hyperkinetic cilia were found to carry DNAH11 mutations. Three novel DNAH11 mutations were detected indicating that this gene should be investigated in patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure and static, as well as hyperkinetic cilia.

22121832	"Cardiopulmonary assessment in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive disorder of ciliary dysfunction associated with lung involvement, which has a great impact on health. There is limited information concerning the aerobic fitness of children and adolescents with PCD. The aim of this study was to assess cardiopulmonary functional capacity and its relationship with pulmonary function and physical activity (PA) levels in patients with PCD. Ten patients with PCD (age 13·2 ± 2·8 years) underwent spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. PA was investigated through a questionnaire. Eight age- and body mass index-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Main variables were forced expiratory volume at 1 s, peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak) ) and time spent in PA. Forty per cent of patients with PCD had impaired lung function as expressed by FEV(1) < 85% predicted. Only patients with impaired lung function exhibited reduced VO(2peak) (18·1 ± 7·9 mL/kg/min). Time spent in total daily PA was slightly lower in patients than controls, with no difference between patients with normal or reduced lung function. In multiple regression models, male gender (β = 0·518, P = 0·018), age (β = 0·752, P = 0·035) and time spent in vigorous PA (β = 0·353, P = 0·049) were independent predictors of aerobic fitness. Assessment of resting pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary functional capacity could contribute to the evaluation of pulmonary impairment in PCD. Given the benefit of physical exercise on airway clearance and on general health and quality of life, patients with PCD should be encouraged to adopt an active lifestyle.

"	"The examination of ciliary ultrastructure in a nasal sample remains a definitive diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The quantitative assessment of ciliary ultrastructure in the diagnosis of PCD over a 20-year period was reviewed. During this period, 1182 patients were referred for ciliary ultrastructural analysis, 242 (20%) of whom were confirmed as having the disease. The two main causes of PCD identified were a lack of outer dynein arms (43%) and a lack of both inner and outer dynein arms (24%). Other causes included transposition, radial spoke and inner dynein arm defects. No specific ultrastructural defects were detected in 33 patients (3%) diagnosed as having PCD on the basis of their clinical features and screening tests that included a low nasal nitric oxide concentration or slow saccharine clearance and abnormal ciliary beat frequency or pattern. Electron microscopy analysis can confirm but does not always exclude a diagnosis of PCD.

22157010	"Functional architecture of the outer arm dynein conformational switch.
"	"Dynein light chain 1 (LC1/DNAL1) is one of the most highly conserved components of ciliary axonemal outer arm dyneins, and it associates with both a heavy chain motor unit and tubulin located within the A-tubule of the axonemal outer doublet microtubules. In a variety of model systems, lack of LC1 or expression of mutant forms leads to profound defects in ciliary motility, including the failure of the hydrodynamic coupling needed for ciliary metachronal synchrony, random stalling during the power/recovery stroke transition, an aberrant response to imposed viscous load, and in some cases partial failure of motor assembly. These phenotypes have led to the proposal that LC1 acts as part of a mechanical switch to control motor function in response to alterations in axonemal curvature. Here we have used NMR chemical shift mapping to define the regions perturbed by a series of mutations in the C-terminal domain that yield a range of phenotypic effects on motility. In addition, we have identified the subdomain of LC1 involved in binding microtubules and characterized the consequences of an Asn → Ser alteration within the terminal leucine-rich repeat that in humans causes primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together, these data define a series of functional subdomains within LC1 and allow us to propose a structural model for the organization of the dynein heavy chain-LC1-microtubule ternary complex that is required for the coordinated activity of dynein motors in cilia.

22218906	"Assessing PCP in the cochlea of mammalian ciliopathy models
"	"The increased availability of mouse models of human genetic ciliary diseases has led to advances in our understanding of the diverse cellular roles played by cilia. The family of so-called ""ciliopathies"" includes Alström Syndrome, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, and Polycystic Kidney Disease, among many others. In mouse models of Alström Syndrome and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, we have shown developmental defects in the mechano-sensory stereociliary bundles on the apical surfaces of ""hair"" cells in the cochlea, the mammalian hearing organ. Stereocilia are specialized actin-based microvilli, whose characteristic patterning is thought to be dependent on the hair cell's primary cilium (""kinocilium""). Ciliopathy-associated proteins are localized to the ciliary axoneme and/or the ciliary basal body, or to the bundle itself. Ciliopathy-associated genes functionally interact with genes of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, and so implicate PCP in the control of hair cell development.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetically heterogenous condition. Mutations in DNAH5 or DNAI1 genes can be found in about a third of the patients with PCD. Increased occurrence of mutations was described in several exons of these long genes. The objective of the study was to test the sensitivity of sequencing of selected 13 exons (as compared to costly sequencing of all 100 exons of the two genes), and to determine the prevalence of the DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations in the Czech PCD database. The Czech national PCD database has identified 31 pediatric patients, diagnosed based on clinical findings and tests on the ciliated epithelium. Twenty-seven patients from 24 families agreed on genetic testing. In the first step, direct sequencing of selected 13 exons (9 of DNAH5 and 4 of DNAI1) was performed, and then we compared its effectiveness in detecting at least one mutation with results of sequencing all 100 exons of the two genes. The sequencing of all exons identified compound heterozygosity for PCD mutations in nine patients from eight families (DNAH5 in eight and DNAI1 in one patient), and heterozygozity for a DNAH5 mutation of uncertain functional significance in one additional patient. The first step of selected exon sequencing detected a mutation in five out of these eight families, its actual sensitivity being 62.5%, with a high predictive value. The phenotypic and clinical characteristics of all the paediatric patients with PCD are shown. Selected exon sequencing detects at least one mutated allele in over a half of our patients who have PCD due to DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations. To lower the costs of the genetic testing, targeted step-wise genetic testing may be a reasonable approach to detect mutations in PCD patients, especially if their phenotype is taken into account.

We aimed to evaluate transversal and longitudinal relationships between lung function test (LFT) and chest computed tomography (CT) in children with PCD, in stable clinical condition. Data from children followed in the French National Center were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were (i) definitive diagnosis of PCD, (ii) age less than 15 years at the beginning of follow-up, (iii) at least 8 years of follow-up, (iv) at least two couples of concurrent CT and LFT available in a phase of clinical stability of the lung disease without modification of the treatment regimen in the last 4 weeks. Twenty children (median age at entry 4.6 years, median follow-up 15.4 years) were included. Concurrent LFT (blood gas and spirometry) and CT (score) results were recorded. LFT indices (PaO(2) (n = 210), FVC, FEV(1) , FEF(2575%) (n = 195)) significantly decreased with age, and the mean annual decrease (z-score (% predicted)) was -0.17 (-0.49%), -0.09 (-0.50%), -0.10 (-0.89%), and -0.07 (-1.73%), respectively. First CT (median age 8.7 years) revealed bronchiectasis (70%), mucous plugging (70%), peribronchial thickening (90%), parenchymal abnormalities (65%), and hyperinflation (50%).

Aiming to delineate the CCDC39/CCDC40 mutation spectrum and associated phenotypes, this study screened a large cohort of patients with IDA defects, in whom clinical and ciliary phenotypes were accurately described. All CCDC39 and CCDC40 exons and intronic boundaries were sequenced in 43 patients from 40 unrelated families. The study recorded and compared clinical features (sex, origin, consanguinity, laterality defects, ages at first symptoms and at phenotype evaluation, neonatal respiratory distress, airway infections, nasal polyposis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, infertility), ciliary beat frequency, and quantitative ultrastructural analyses of cilia and sperm flagella. Biallelic CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations were identified in 30/34 (88.2%) unrelated families with IDA defects associated with axonemal disorganisation (22 and eight families, respectively). Fourteen of the 28 identified mutations are novel. No mutation was found in the six families with isolated IDA defects. Patients with identified mutations shared a similar phenotype, in terms of both clinical features and ciliary structure and function. The sperm flagellar ultrastructure, analysed in 4/7 infertile males, showed evidence of abnormalities similar to the ciliary ones. CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations represent the major cause of PCD with IDA defects and axonemal disorganisation. Patients carrying CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations are phenotypically indistinguishable. CCDC39 and CCDC40 analyses in selected patients ensure mutations are found with high probability, even if clinical or ciliary phenotypes cannot prioritise one analysis over the other.

We sought to review the otological presentation of children with PCD treated medically and surgically and to compare audiological outcomes and complications of surgical and medical management in children with PCD and correlate these findings with known PCD ultrastructural ciliary phenotype. A retrospective review was performed of all patients with PCD and OME presenting from 1991 to 2009. Patients were grouped into ""medical management"" and ""ventilation tube (VT) insertion"" groups to observe changes in hearing and post-operative complications. Of 31 patients with PCD and OME, 20 received VTs and 11 were treated by medical management strategies. A median of one set of VTs (range 1-5) were inserted per patient. Hearing thresholds improved to normal (<25 dB HL) in 80% ears with VTs (mean improvement from 27.1 dB to 22.1 dB (p=0.034)), whereas patients managed medically had stable thresholds (22.7-23.6 dB (p=0.397) over the study period. At least one episode of post-operative otorrhea occurred in eight (42.1%) VT insertion patients during the study period, and four had multiple episodes. We could not demonstrate any differences in post-surgical outcomes between patient groups based on ultrastructural ciliary phenotype. Otorrhea was well controlled with medical therapy with only one requiring tube removal. Bilateral cholesteatoma was found in two patients. Our data support the use of VT insertion as an option for patients with PCD and OME with mild to moderate hearing loss. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of multiple insertions and the likelihood of post-operative otorrhea, although this was not very troublesome in our group. Ultrastructural ciliary phenotype did not appear to alter the likelihood of post-operative otorrhea in our series. Cholesteatoma should be considered as a potential cause of otorrhea in PCD.

"	"RPGR gene encodes retinitis pigmentosa guanosine triphosphatase regulator protein, mutations of which cause 70% of the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) cases. Rarely, RPGR mutations can also cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and male subfertility. Two patients with PCD\_RP and their relatives were analyzed using DNA sequencing, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), photometry, and high-speed videomicroscopy. The Polish patient carried a previously known c.154G>A substitution (p.Gly52Arg) in exon 2 (known to affect splicing); the mutation was co-segregating with the XLRP symptoms in his family. The c.824 G>T mutation (p. Gly275Val) in the Australian patient was a de novo mutation. In both patients, TEM and IF did not reveal any changes in the respiratory cilia structure. However, following ciliogenesis in vitro, in contrast to the ciliary beat frequency, the ciliary beat coordination in the spheroids from the Polish proband and his relatives carrying the c.154G>A mutation was reduced. Analysis of the ciliary alignment indicated severely disturbed orientation of cilia. Therefore, we confirm that defects in the RPGR protein may contribute to syndromic PCD. Lack of ultrastructural defects in respiratory cilia of the probands, the reduced ciliary orientation and the decreased coordination of the ciliary bundles observed in the Polish patient suggested that the RPGR protein may play a role in the establishment of the proper respiratory cilia orientation.

"	"Airway cilia depend on precise changes in shape to transport the mucus gel overlying mucosal surfaces. The ciliary motion can be recorded in several planes using video microscopy. However, cilia are densely packed, and automated computerized systems are not available to convert these ciliary shape changes into forms that are useful for testing theoretical models of ciliary function. We developed a system for converting planar ciliary motions recorded by video microscopy into an empirical quantitative model, which is easy to use in validating mathematical models, or in examining ciliary function, e.g., in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The system we developed allows the manipulation of a model cilium superimposed over a video of beating cilia. Data were analyzed to determine shear angles and velocity vectors of points along the cilium. Extracted waveforms were used to construct a composite waveform, which could be used as a standard. Variability was measured as the mean difference in position of points on individual waveforms and the standard. The shapes analyzed were the end-recovery, end-effective, and fastest moving effective and recovery with mean (± SE) differences of 0.31(0.04), 0.25(0.06), 0.50(0.12), 0.50(0.10), μm, respectively.

The World Health Organization specifically recommends cough etiquette to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but implementation is generally poor and evidence supporting its value is lacking. We constructed a model to assess 'real life' transmission risk by counting viable pathogens from aerosols produced by coughing patients, thus allowing the assessment of outward protection measures in a standardised fashion. During the validation process, we focused on rod-shaped bacteria as surrogates for M. tuberculosis. The Cough Cylinder enabled us to sample Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and mycobacteria from aerosols produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and tuberculosis. Pathogens in droplets and in airborne particles could be sampled. Delayed air sampling allowed specific measurement of persistent airborne particles. This novel experimental system allows measurement of aerosol pathogen spread in a highly standardised fashion. It also offers the possibility to assess the impact of different interventions to limit aerosol transmission.

23292041	"Ciliary ultrastructure in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"The Cilia represent one of the main mechanisms contributing to the clearance of microorganisms and particles from the respiratory epithelium. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically determined disorder characterized by irreversible systemic dysmotility of the cilia. Secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) differs from primary defects on the reversible ultrastructural alterations that can occur after any insult to a previously normal mucosa. Hence, this study aimed to describe and compare the main ultrastructural ciliary features in PCD and SCD through transmission electron microscopy. The most frequent PCD abnormalities were missing or short dynein arms, missing central microtubules, and displacement of one of the nine peripheral doublets. The most common changes found in SCD were compound cilia and peripheral microtubule alterations associated with modifications of the respiratory epithelium. PCD presented a higher percentage of altered cilia (>30 %) when compared to SCD (5 %), demonstrating that SCD is more limited in area than PCD. Whereas in PCD the changes in the dynein arms and in the central microtubules are fundamental for diagnostic confirmation, the diagnosis of SCD usually involves compound cilia and disarrangements in peripheral microtubules.

23299155	"Significance of fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurements in detecting primary ciliary dyskinesia in Saudi children
"	"To examine the usefulness of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurements in detecting primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in children. This observational study was conducted at the Department of Pediatrics and Physiology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from January 2011 to December 2011. The study population consisted of 22 children with symptoms suggestive of PCD and the diagnosis was confirmed by ciliary biopsy. Using the American Thoracic Society guidelines, measurements of FENO were performed in 22 subjects with proven PCD biopsies and in 11 healthy age-matched subjects. No significant differences were found on the basis of age or ventilatory function tests between the PCD patients and control groups. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide values were significantly lower in children with PCD (6.19+/-1.43) compared to control group (17.00+/-6.30) (CI: -14.854 to -5.927, p<0.0001). Rhinorrhea was seen in 7 (31.8%), recurrent acute otitis media in 16 (72.7%), chronic otitis media in 5 (22.7%), recurrent sinusitis in 5 (22.7%), chronic productive cough in 8 (36.4%), bronchospasm in 11 (50%), and dextrocardia in 3 (13.6%) subjects. There was no correlation between age, FENO, and ventilatory function parameters. The measurement of FENO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD. It can complement other tests such as nasal biopsy and electron microscopy studies.

23351276	"ciliaFA: a research tool for automated, high-throughput measurement of ciliary beat frequency using freely available software
"	"Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz. Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal (frequency range 34 to 52 Hz) and respiratory epithelial cells (frequency 3 to 18 Hz) were captured using a high-speed digital video recorder. To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system. The overall mean difference (± SD) between the ciliaFA and direct measurement high-speed digital imaging methods was -0.05 ± 1.25 Hz, the correlation coefficient was shown to be 0.991 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from -1.99 to 1.49 Hz for respiratory and from -2.55 to 3.25 Hz for ependymal cilia. A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) using Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias. We have included free access to the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by dysfunction of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella and random determination of visceral asymmetry. Here, we identify the DRC1 subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), an axonemal structure critical for the regulation of dynein motors, and show that mutations in the gene encoding DRC1, CCDC164, are involved in PCD pathogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations disrupting DRC1 result in severe defects in assembly of the N-DRC structure and defective ciliary movement in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and humans. Our results highlight a role for N-DRC integrity in regulating ciliary beating and provide the first direct evidence that mutations in DRC genes cause human disease.

23418344	"Sperm-associated antigen-17 gene is essential for motile cilia function and neonatal survival
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting from defects in cilia assembly or motility, is caused by mutations in a number of genes encoding axonemal proteins. PCD phenotypes are variable, and include recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, hydrocephaly, situs inversus, and male infertility. We generated knockout mice for the sperm-associated antigen-17 (Spag17) gene, which encodes a central pair (CP) protein present in the axonemes of cells with ""9 + 2"" motile cilia or flagella. The targeting of Spag17 resulted in a severe phenotype characterized by immotile nasal and tracheal cilia, reduced clearance of nasal mucus, profound respiratory distress associated with lung fluid accumulation and disruption of the alveolar epithelium, cerebral ventricular expansion consistent with emerging hydrocephalus, failure to suckle, and neonatal demise within 12 hours of birth. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the loss of one CP microtubule in approximately one quarter of tracheal cilia axonemes, an absence of a C1 microtubule projection, and other less frequent CP structural abnormalities. SPAG6 and SPAG16 (CP proteins that interact with SPAG17) were increased in tracheal tissue from SPAG17-deficient mice. We conclude that Spag17 plays a critical role in the function and structure of motile cilia, and that neonatal lethality is likely explained by impaired airway mucociliary clearance.

"	"Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement is an established first line test in the work-up for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Tidal breathing nNO (TB-nNO) measurements require minimal cooperation and are potentially useful even in young children. Hand-held NO devices are becoming increasingly widespread for asthma management. Therefore, we chose to assess whether hand-held TB-nNO measurements reliably discriminate between PCD, and Healthy Subjects (HS) and included Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients as a disease control group known to have intermediate nNO levels. In this cross sectional, single centre, single occasion, proof-of-concept study in children and adults with PCD and CF, and in HS we compared feasibility, success rates, discriminatory capacity, repeatability and agreement between a hand-held electrochemical device equipped with a nNO software application sampling at flow rates 2 ml/s or 5 ml/s, and two stationary chemiluminescence devices, applying both tidal breathing and velum closure techniques. Measurements were done in 16 PCD patients, 21 patients with CF and 20 HS aged between 3.8 and 60.9 years. Hand-held TB-nNO showed high success rate (96.5-100%) vs. velum closure nNO techniques (70.2-89.5%). Hand-held TB-nNO sampling at flow rate 5 ml/s showed equally high discriminative power (PCD vs. HS [p<0.0001] and PCD vs. CF [p<0.0001]) and reaching close to 100% sensitivity and specificity, superior repeatability (CV% = 10%) and equal limits of agreement compared to TB-nNO by stationary devices and even compared to velum closure sampling. Hand-held TB-nNO discriminates significantly between PCD, CF and HS and shows promising potential as a widespread targeted case-finding tool for PCD, although further studies are warranted before implementation.

"	"The study of nasal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and ultrastructure may contribute to the understanding of pathognomonic cases of male infertility associated with defects in sperm motility. This study was designed to report a particular case of male infertility, characterized by the association of two respiratory autosomal recessive genetic diseases (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency [AAT-D] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). A 39-year-old patient with complete sperm immotility, AAT-D, and bronchiectasis was studied in the Laboratory of Male Fertility, the Department of Urology, the Respiratory Center of a Pediatric Hospital, and in the Department of Clinical Medicine of a Rehabilitation Respiratory Hospital. Family history, physical examination, hormonal analysis, microbial assays, semen analysis, nasal ciliary function, and structure study by digital high-speed video photography and transmission electron microscopy are described. A noninvasive nasal biopsy to retrieve ciliated epithelium lining the inferior surface of the inferior nasal turbinates was performed and CBF was determined. Beat pattern was slightly curved and rigid, not wide, and metacronic in all the observed fields analyzed. CBF was 8.2 Hz in average (reference value, 10-15 Hz) Ultrastructural assay revealed absence of the inner dynein arms in 97% of the cilia observed. The final infertility accurate diagnosis was achieved by the study of nasal CBF and ultrastructure contributing to the patient health management and genetic counseling while deciding fatherhood. Beyond this particular case, the present report may open a new field of studies in male infertility, mainly in cases of asthenozoospermia.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, respiratory distress in term neonates, laterality (situs) defects, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities seen by electron microscopy. Mutations in radial spoke head proteins occur in PCD patients with central apparatus defects. Advances in genetic testing have been crucial in addressing the diagnostic challenge. Here, we describe a novel splice-site mutation (c.921+3_6delAAGT) in RSPH4A, which leads to a premature translation termination signal in nine subjects with PCD (seven families). Loss-of-function was confirmed with quantitative ciliary ultrastructural analysis, measurement of ciliary beat frequency and waveform, and transcript analysis. All nine individuals carrying c.921+3_6delAAGT splice-site mutation in RSPH4A were Hispanic with ancestry tracing to Puerto Rico. This mutation is a founder mutation and a common cause of PCD without situs abnormalities in patients of Puerto Rican descent.

"	"DYX1C1 has been associated with dyslexia and neuronal migration in the developing neocortex. Unexpectedly, we found that deleting exons 2-4 of Dyx1c1 in mice caused a phenotype resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic airway disease, laterality defects and male infertility. This phenotype was confirmed independently in mice with a Dyx1c1 c.T2A start-codon mutation recovered from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. Morpholinos targeting dyx1c1 in zebrafish also caused laterality and ciliary motility defects. In humans, we identified recessive loss-of-function DYX1C1 mutations in 12 individuals with PCD. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analyses of DYX1C1-mutant motile cilia in mice and humans showed disruptions of outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs, respectively). DYX1C1 localizes to the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells, its interactome is enriched for molecular chaperones, and it interacts with the cytoplasmic ODA and IDA assembly factor DNAAF2 (KTU). Thus, we propose that DYX1C1 is a newly identified dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF4).

"	"Multiple causes for tree-in-bud (TIB) opacities have been reported. However, to our knowledge the relative frequencies of the causes have not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative frequency of causes of TIB opacities and identify patterns of disease associated with TIB opacities. Cases with TIB opacities in the radiology report in 2010 were identified by searching the Radiology Information System. Medical records and CT scan examinations were reviewed for the causes of TIB opacities. Patterns of disease associated with TIB opacities were evaluated. Causes for TIB opacities were established in 166 of 406 (40.9%) cases. Respiratory infections (119 of 166, 72%) with mycobacteria (65 of 166, 39%), bacteria (44 of 166, 27%), viruses (four of 166, 3%), or multiple organisms (six of 166, 4%) were most common. Aspiration was the cause in 42 of 166 (25%). Alternating areas of normal lung with regions of small airways disease (TIB opacities, bronchiectasis) (random small airways pattern) was specific (0.92) for Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Nearly uniform distribution of bronchiectasis (widespread bronchiectasis pattern) was specific for ""diseases predisposing to airway infection"" (specificity 0.92), such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and immunodeficiency states. Consolidation and TIB opacities (bronchopneumonia pattern) were usually due to bacterial infection or aspiration. Dependent distribution (specificity 0.79) and esophageal abnormality (specificity 0.86) with TIB opacities were associated with aspiration. Chronicity of findings was associated with mycobacterial infection (P &lt; .0001, sensitivity 0.96). Acuteness of findings was associated with bacterial infection (P &lt; .001, specificity 0.87). TIB opacities are most often a manifestation of infections or aspiration. Patterns of disease can provide clues to the most likely diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 20 genes, but collectively they account for only ∼65% of all PCDs. To identify mutations in additional genes that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on three unrelated probands with ciliary outer and inner dynein arm (ODA+IDA) defects. Mutations in SPAG1 were identified in one family with three affected siblings. Further screening of SPAG1 in 98 unrelated affected individuals (62 with ODA+IDA defects, 35 with ODA defects, 1 without available ciliary ultrastructure) revealed biallelic loss-of-function mutations in 11 additional individuals (including one sib-pair). All 14 affected individuals with SPAG1 mutations had a characteristic PCD phenotype, including 8 with situs abnormalities. Additionally, all individuals with mutations who had defined ciliary ultrastructure had ODA+IDA defects. SPAG1 was present in human airway epithelial cell lysates but was not present in isolated axonemes, and immunofluorescence staining showed an absence of ODA and IDA proteins in cilia from an affected individual, thus indicating that SPAG1 probably plays a role in the cytoplasmic assembly and/or trafficking of the axonemal dynein arms. Zebrafish morpholino studies of spag1 produced cilia-related phenotypes previously reported for PCD-causing mutations in genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins. Together, these results demonstrate that mutations in SPAG1 cause PCD with ciliary ODA+IDA defects and that exome sequencing is useful to identify genetic causes of heterogeneous recessive disorders.

"	"Impaired mucociliary clearance causes pulmonary disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Although the sinopulmonary disease is similar, morbidity and mortality are different. Both patients with PCD and patients with CF with pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS) show no nutrient malabsorption and are diagnosed at a later age compared with patients with CF with pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI). Clinical status, microbiology, FEV1, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans presented as total Brody score (CT-TBS) were compared for patients with PCD, CF-PI, and CF-PS, all treated at the same medical center, by the same team, and by a similar routine follow-up. One hundred sixty-four patients, 34 with PCD, 88 with CF-PI, and 42 with CF-PS were enrolled. PCD was diagnosed at a similar age as CF-PS but significantly later than CF-PI. Mean FEV1 % predicted was similar for the three groups. The rate of FEV1 change with age in PCD was similar to CF-PS but significantly lower than in CF-PI. Severity of structural lung disease (CT-TBS) was similar for PCD and CF-PS and significantly higher in CF-PI. No correlation between TBS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and FEV1 in PCD was seen, whereas a negative correlation with FEV1 was observed for both CF groups. Although in our study PCD was similar to CF-PS, the lack of correlation between FEV1 and age, CT-TBS, and P aeruginosa infection in PCD suggests that impaired mucociliary clearance is not the only cause for inducing pulmonary damage in these diseases. Furthermore, a comparison of disease characteristics for PCD and CF should distinguish between CF-PI and CF-PS as different entities.

"	"We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused when defects of motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, male infertility, and situs abnormalities. Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia function remain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an in vivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.

24226769	"The heterotaxy gene GALNT11 glycosylates Notch to orchestrate cilia type and laterality
"	"Heterotaxy is a disorder of left-right body patterning, or laterality, that is associated with major congenital heart disease. The aetiology and mechanisms underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals. The mechanism that specifies these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a patient with heterotaxy, and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11 activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1 signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch, establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for human heterotaxy.

24236100	"Reduced nasal nitric oxide production in cystic fibrosis patients with elevated systemic inflammation markers
"	"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced within the respiratory tract and can be detected in exhaled bronchial and nasal air. The concentration varies in specific diseases, being elevated in patients with asthma and bronchiectasis, but decreased in primary ciliary dyskinesia. In cystic fibrosis (CF), conflicting data exist on NO levels, which are reported unexplained as either decreased or normal. Functionally, NO production in the paranasal sinuses is considered as a location-specific first-line defence mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between upper and lower airway NO levels and blood inflammatory parameters, CF-pathogen colonisation, and clinical data. Nasal and bronchial NO concentrations from 57 CF patients were determined using an electrochemical analyser and correlated to pathogen colonisation of the upper and lower airways which were microbiologically assessed from nasal lavage and sputum samples. Statistical analyses were performed with respect to clinical parameters (lung function, BMI), laboratory findings (CRP, leucocytes, total-IgG, fibrinogen), and anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy. There were significant correlations between nasal and bronchial NO levels (rho = 0.48, p<0.001), but no correlation between NO levels and specific pathogen colonisation. In patients receiving azithromycin, significantly reduced bronchial NO and a tendency to reduced nasal NO could be found. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation of nasal NO to CRP (rho = -0.28, p = 0.04) and to leucocytes (rho = -0.41, p = 0.003) was observed. In contrast, bronchial NO levels showed no correlation to clinical or inflammatory parameters. Given that NO in the paranasal sinuses is part of the first-line defence mechanism against pathogens, our finding of reduced nasal NO in CF patients with elevated systemic inflammatory markers indicates impaired upper airway defence. This may facilitate further pathogen acquisition in the sinonasal area, with consequences for lung colonisation and the overall outcome in CF.

We had a 27-year-old female patient with KS who presented with proteinuria, hematuria, normal kidney function, and a family history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Kidney biopsy showed segmental scar with adhesion to Bowman capsule, which was indicative of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

"	"Ten to fifteen percent of couples are confronted with infertility and a male factor is involved in approximately half the cases. A genetic etiology is likely in most cases yet only few genes have been formally correlated with male infertility. Homozygosity mapping was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals, including 18 index cases, presenting with primary infertility resulting from impaired sperm motility caused by a mosaic of multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) including absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular flagella. Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28%) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.

"	"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in children has been associated with a variety of disorders including atopic disease, cystic fibrosis, immunologic disorders and ciliary dyskinesia. Although a strong association, or even cause and effect relationship, between allergic rhinitis (AR) and CRS is commonly assumed, the epidemiologic relationship between these disorders has not yet been defined in children. A retrospective review of all children diagnosed with CRS on otolaryngology or allergy office evaluation at a large tertiary-care pediatric hospital over a ten-year period was performed. Demographic data and concomitant diagnoses of AR, cystic fibrosis, immunologic disorders and primary ciliary dyskinesia were analyzed for relationships with CRS. A total of 4044 children with an average age of 8.9 years and a slight male predominance (53.8%) with CRS were identified. Of these children, 0.2% had primary ciliary dyskinesia, 4.1% had cystic fibrosis, 12.3% had an immunologic disorder, and 26.9% had AR. A concomitant asthma diagnosis was positively associated with a diagnosis of AR (OR=6.24, 95% CI: 5.27-7.39, P<0.001), whereas a concomitant cystic fibrosis diagnosis was negatively associated (OR=0.12, 95% CI: 0.06-0.26, P<0.001). AR is more prevalent than the other comorbidities combined in children with CRS, and is independently associated with the presence of asthma. Formal allergy testing, guided by clinical history and regional allergen sensitivity prevalence, should be strongly considered in all children with CRS, in particular those with reactive airway disease.

We determined BMI and spirometry in 158 PCD children and adolescents from London, UK (n = 75), Naples, Italy (n = 23) and Copenhagen, Denmark (n = 60) at first presentation and during follow-up. Annual BMI and spirometry were prospectively collected and analyzed over blocks of 2, 4, and 6 consecutive years. Sputum pathogens were recorded. Age at first spirometry was 8.7 years (range, 4.2-17.4). Mean Z scores of first measured BMI, FEV1, FVC, and FEF(25-75) were 0.01, -1.37, -0.84, and -1.68, respectively. First spirometry was not more frequently impaired in patients referred at age ≥6 years than in those referred at preschool age (P = 0.13). There were no differences in slopes for BMI, FEV1, FVC, or FEF(25-75) over any time block. H. influenzae was the most common pathogen, isolated at least once in 65% of patients. P. aeruginosa was found in 58 subjects (37%) of whom 8 (5%) were chronically infected. Neither pathogens was associated with spirometry changes. Preschool referral to a PCD center was not associated with better spirometry or BMI. PCD children and adolescents receiving centralized care show steady BMI and spirometry during medium term follow-up. There was a high prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, but the evolution of spirometry or BMI was not affected by this microorganism in medium term. Despite our longitudinal analysis showed no differences between the three centers, the assessment of spirometry and BMI over time represents a quality improvement tool. Future studies are needed to highlight the role of spirometry and BMI in long term PCD management and identify subgroups of patients with a higher risk of early lung failure or nutritional problems.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disorder with variable disease progression. To date, mutations in more than 20 different genes have been found. At present, PCD subtypes are described according to the ultrastructural defect on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the motile cilia. PCD with normal ultrastructure (NU) is rarely reported because it requires additional testing. Biallelic mutations in DNAH11 have been described as one cause of PCD with NU.The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD, in relation to the ultrastructural defect. Additionally, we aimed to demonstrate the need for biopsy and cell culture to reliably diagnose PCD, especially the NU subtype. We retrospectively analyzed data from 206 patients with PCD. We compared the clinical characteristics, lung function, microbiology and imaging results of 68 patients with PCD and NU to those of 90 patients with dynein deficiencies and 41 patients with central pair abnormalities. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the robustness of the diagnosis of the NU subtype in cell culture by data from genetic analysis. PCD with NU comprised 33% (68/206) of all patients with PCD. Compared to other subtypes, patients with PCD and NU had a similar frequency of upper and lower respiratory tract problems, as well as similar lung function and imaging. With the currently widely applied approach, without cell culture, the diagnosis would have been missed in 16% (11/68) of patients with NU. Genetic analysis was performed in 29/68 patients with PCD and NU, and biallelic mutations were found in 79% (23/29) of tested patients. We reported on the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD and NU. We have shown that systematic performance of biopsy and cell culture increases sensitivity to detect PCD, especially the subtype with NU.PCD with NU has similar clinical characteristics as other PCD types and requires biopsy plus ciliogenesis in culture for optimal diagnostic yield.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogenous autosomal recessive disease in which mutations disrupt ciliary function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and life-long lung disease. Mouse tracheal cells with a targeted deletion in the axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 (Dnaic1) gene differentiate normally in culture but lack ciliary activity. Gene transfer to undifferentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with avian influenza hemagglutinin restored Dnaic1 expression and ciliary activity. Importantly, apical treatment of well-differentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with lentiviral vector also restored ciliary activity, demonstrating successful gene transfer from the apical surface. Treatment of Dnaic1(flox/flox) mice expressing an estrogen-responsive Cre recombinase with different doses of tamoxifen indicated that restoration of ∼20% of ciliary activity may be sufficient to prevent the development of rhinosinusitis. However, although administration of a β-galactosidase-expressing vector into control mice demonstrated efficient gene transfer to the nasal epithelium, treatment of Dnaic1(-/-) mice resulted in a low level of gene transfer, demonstrating that the severe rhinitis present in these animals impedes gene transfer. The results demonstrate that gene replacement therapy may be a viable treatment option for PCD, but further improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer are necessary.

We analyzed longitudinal data on body length/height and body mass index (BMI) for 29 children and young adults with PCD aging 1.5-24 years (median, 14.5) who had been diagnosed at the age of 0.5-17 years (median, 8). Of these, 10 carried pathogenic mutations in either DNAH5 or DNAI1. In children with PCD, body length/height progressively decreased from +0.40 ± 0.24 SDS (the 1st birthday), +0.16 ± 0.23 SDS (3 years old), and -0.13 ± 0.21 SDS (5 years old) to -0.54 ± 0.19 SDS (7 years old; P = 0.01 versus 0), -0.67 ± 0.21 SDS (9 years old; P = 0.005 versus 0), -0.52 ± 0.24 SDS (11 years old; P = 0.04 versus 0), and -0.53 ± 0.23 SDS (13 years old; P = 0.03 versus 0). These results reflect low growth rates during the childhood growth period. Thereafter, heights stabilized up to the age of 17 years. The growth deterioration was not dependent on sex or disease severity but was more pronounced in DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutation carriers. BMI did not differ from population standards, which suggests that nutritional deficits are not the cause of growth delay. We conclude that PCD leads to chronic deprivation with significant growth deterioration during childhood.

24498942	"The role of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of motile cilia. The diagnosis of PCD has previously relied on ciliary analysis with transmission electron microscopy or video microscopy. However, patients with PCD may have normal ultrastructural appearance, and ciliary analysis has limited accessibility. Alternatively, PCD can be diagnosed by demonstrating biallelic mutations in known PCD genes. Genetic testing is emerging as a diagnostic tool to complement ciliary analysis where interpretation and access may delay diagnosis. To determine the diagnostic yield of genetic testing of patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of PCD in a multiethnic urban center. Twenty-eight individuals with confirmed PCD on transmission electron microscopy of ciliary ultrastructure and 24 individuals with a probable diagnosis of PCD based on a classical PCD phenotype and low nasal nitric oxide had molecular analysis of 12 genes associated with PCD. Of 49 subjects who underwent ciliary biopsy, 28 (57%) were diagnosed with PCD through an ultrastructural defect. Of the 52 individuals who underwent molecular genetic analysis, 22 (42%) individuals had two mutations in known PCD genes. Twenty-four previously unreported mutations in known PCD genes were observed. Combining both diagnostic modalities of biopsy and molecular genetics, the diagnostic yield increased to 69% compared with 57% based on biopsy alone. The diagnosis of PCD is challenging and has traditionally relied on ciliary biopsy, which is unreliable as the sole criterion for a definitive diagnosis. Molecular genetic analysis can be used as a complementary test to increase the diagnostic yield.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis and male infertility. The pulmonary phenotype in PCD is caused by the impaired motility of cilia in the respiratory epithelium, due to ultrastructural defects of these organelles. We hypothesized that defects of multi-protein ciliary complexes should be reflected by gene expression changes in the respiratory epithelium. We have previously found that large group of genes functionally related to cilia share highly correlated expression pattern in PCD bronchial tissue. Here we performed an explorative analysis of differential gene expression in the bronchial tissue from six PCD patients and nine non-PCD controls, using Illumina HumanRef-12 Whole Genome BeadChips. We observed 1323 genes with at least 2-fold difference in the mean expression level between the two groups (t-test p-value <0.05). Annotation analysis showed that the genes down-regulated in PCD biopsies (602) were significantly enriched for terms related to cilia, whereas the up-regulated genes (721) were significantly enriched for terms related to cell cycle and mitosis. We assembled a list of human genes predicted to encode ciliary proteins, components of outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, radial spokes, and intraflagellar transport proteins. A significant down-regulation of the expression of genes from all the four groups was observed in PCD, compared to non-PCD biopsies. Our data suggest that a coordinated down-regulation of the ciliome genes plays an important role in the molecular pathomechanism of PCD.

"	"Cilia play major functions in physiology and development, and ciliary dysfunctions are responsible for several diseases in humans called ciliopathies. Cilia motility is required for cell and fluid propulsion in organisms. In humans, cilia motility deficiencies lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, with upper-airways recurrent infections, left-right asymmetry perturbations, and fertility defects. In Drosophila, we identified hemingway (hmw) as a novel component required for motile cilia function. hmw encodes a 604-amino acid protein characterized by a highly conserved coiled-coil domain also found in the human orthologue, KIAA1430. We show that HMW is conserved in species with motile cilia and that, in Drosophila, hmw is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and spermatozoa. We created hmw-knockout flies and found that they are hearing impaired and male sterile. hmw is implicated in the motility of ciliated auditory sensory neurons and, in the testis, is required for elongation and maintenance of sperm flagella. Because HMW is absent from mature flagella, we propose that HMW is not a structural component of the motile axoneme but is required for proper acquisition of motile properties. This identifies HMW as a novel, evolutionarily conserved component necessary for motile cilium function and flagella assembly.

All subjects were evaluated for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding MBL-2. The diagnosis of PCD was established in 45 subjects, while in the remaining 53 the diagnosis was SCD. A significant bronchodilator response was observed only in PCD associated with the MBL2-3 genotype, which is known to be associated with low/undetectable MBL serum levels. Also, bronchiectasis severity was significantly greater in subjects with MBL2-3 in both PCD and SCD. No other association was found between MBL genotypes and clinical findings. MBL plays a relatively minor role as a disease modifier in PCD. A similar finding in SCD supports the likely significance of this result.

"	"We present a study of five children from three unrelated Irish Traveller families presenting with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). As previously characterized disorders in the Irish Traveller population are caused by common homozygous mutations, we hypothesised that all three PCD families shared the same recessive mutation. However, exome sequencing showed that there was no pathogenic homozygous mutation common to all families. This finding was supported by histology, which showed that each family has a different type of ciliary defect; transposition defect (family A), nude epithelium (family B) and absence of inner and outer dynein arms (family C). Therefore, each family was analysed independently using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The affected siblings in family A share a novel 1 bp duplication in RSPH4A (NM\_001161664.1:c.166dup; p.Arg56Profs_11), a radial-spoke head protein involved in ciliary movement.

MCIDAS mutant respiratory epithelial cells carry only one or two cilia per cell, which lack ciliary motility-related proteins (DNAH5; CCDC39) as seen in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Consistent with this finding, FOXJ1-regulating axonemal motor protein expression is absent in respiratory cells of MCIDAS mutant individuals. CCNO, when mutated known to cause RGMC, is also absent in MCIDAS mutant respiratory cells, consistent with its downstream activity.

"	"Cilia are microtubule-based hair-like organelles that play many important roles in development and physiology, and are implicated in a rapidly expanding spectrum of human diseases, collectively termed ciliopathies. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), one of the most prevalent of ciliopathies, arises from abnormalities in the differentiation or motility of the motile cilia. Despite their biomedical importance, a methodical functional screen for ciliary genes has not been carried out in any vertebrate at the organismal level. We sought to systematically discover novel motile cilia genes by identifying the genes induced by Foxj1, a winged-helix transcription factor that has an evolutionarily conserved role as the master regulator of motile cilia biogenesis. Unexpectedly, we find that the majority of the Foxj1-induced genes have not been associated with cilia before. To characterize these novel putative ciliary genes, we subjected 50 randomly selected candidates to a systematic functional phenotypic screen in zebrafish embryos. Remarkably, we find that over 60% are required for ciliary differentiation or function, whereas 30% of the proteins encoded by these genes localize to motile cilia. We also show that these genes regulate the proper differentiation and beating of motile cilia. This collection of Foxj1-induced genes will be invaluable for furthering our understanding of ciliary biology, and in the identification of new mutations underlying ciliary disorders in humans.

"	"Nitric oxide plays an important role in several physiological and pathophysiological processes in the respiratory tract. Different ways to measure nasal nitric oxide levels in children are currently available. The possibility of obtaining nasal nitric oxide measurement from relatively young children, combined with the availability of portable devices that can be used even in the office setting, opens new perspectives for nasal nitric oxide analysis in the pediatric daily practice. This review presents a synopsis about the current clinical applications of nasal nitric oxide measurement in the pediatric clinical practice. A total of 3,775 articles on the topic were identified, of which 883 duplicates were removed, and 2,803 were excluded based on review of titles and abstracts. Eighty-nine full text articles were assessed for eligibility and 32 additional articles were obtained from the reference lists of the retrieved studies. Since very low nasal nitric oxide levels are found in the majority of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, most publications support a central role for nasal nitric oxide to screen the disease, and indicate that it is a very helpful first-line tool in the real-life work-up in all age groups. Decreased nasal nitric oxide concentration is also typical of cystic fibrosis, even though nasal nitric oxide is not as low as in primary ciliary dyskinesia. In other upper airway disorders such as allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, and adenoidal hypertrophy, clinical utility of nasal nitric oxide is still critically questioned and remains to be established. Since nNO determination is flow dependent, a general consensus from the major investigators in this area is highly desirable so that future studies will be performed with the same flow rate. A shared nNO methodology will enable to overcome the challenges that lie ahead in incorporating nNO measurement into the mainstream clinical setting of pediatric airway diseases.

A 17-year-old female patient presented with repeated refractory airway infection. She also had bronchiectasis and situs inversus. Electron microscopic evaluation of her nasal mucosa revealed ciliary defect and confirmed the diagnosis of KS. She underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) followed by long-term postoperative debridement of the sinonasal cavity. This treatment reduced chronic rhinosinusitis and protected against subsequent airway infection in a 7-year follow-up. FESS is effective for relieving both chronic rhinosinusitis and lung infection of KS in the long term.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function that leads to subsequent clinical phenotypes such as chronic sinopulmonary disease. PCD is also a genetically heterogeneous disorder with many single gene mutations leading to similar clinical phenotypes. Here, we present a novel PCD causal gene, coiled-coil domain containing 151 (CCDC151), which has been shown to be essential in motile cilia of many animals and other vertebrates but its effects in humans was not observed until currently. We observed a novel nonsense mutation in a homozygous state in the CCDC151 gene (NM\_145045.4:c.925G>T:p.[E309\*]) in a clinically diagnosed PCD patient from a consanguineous family of Arabic ancestry. The variant was absent in 238 randomly selected individuals indicating that the variant is rare and likely not to be a founder mutation. Our finding also shows that given prior knowledge from model organisms, even a single whole-exome sequence can be sufficient to discover a novel causal gene.

25226371	"Peripheral vestibular dysfunction in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: abnormal otoconial development?
"	"Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have absent or reduced otoconial function compared to the normal population. Investigations in zebrafish show that ciliation is important for the development of the otolith organs, but this has never been evaluated in humans. PCD is a congenital defect of ciliary structure. We undertook a pilot study to determine whether patients with PCD have absent or reduced otoconial function compared to the normal population. Vestibular function testing, including utricular centrifugation (UCF) testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and electronystagmography, was undertaken in five patients with known PCD. Patients also completed validated questionnaires regarding subjective balance function and symptoms. There were markedly reduced or unobtainable VEMPs bilaterally in three of the five subjects and unilaterally in the remaining two subjects. No subject had a pathological UCF asymmetry, but three subjects showed utricular abnormalities. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) at 0.25 Hz sinusoidal rotation was normal in all subjects. There were no subjective dizzy symptoms or balance issues. We speculate that the reduced saccular and utricular function in PCD patients observed in this pilot study suggests a relationship between cilia structure and/or motility, and otoconia seeding and/or positioning. Further investigation is warranted.

"	"Cilia are highly conserved microtubule-based structures that perform a variety of sensory and motility functions during development and adult homeostasis. In humans, defects specifically affecting motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, infertility and laterality defects in the genetically heterogeneous disorder Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Using the comparatively simple Drosophila system, in which mechanosensory neurons possess modified motile cilia, we employed a recently elucidated cilia transcriptional RFX-FOX code to identify novel PCD candidate genes. Here, we report characterization of CG31320/HEATR2, which plays a conserved critical role in forming the axonemal dynein arms required for ciliary motility in both flies and humans. Inner and outer arm dyneins are absent from axonemes of CG31320 mutant flies and from PCD individuals with a novel splice-acceptor HEATR2 mutation. Functional conservation of closely arranged RFX-FOX binding sites upstream of HEATR2 orthologues may drive higher cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during early motile ciliogenesis. Immunoprecipitation reveals HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2, but not HSP70 or HSP90, distinguishing it from the client/chaperone functions described for other cytoplasmic proteins required for dynein arm assembly such as DNAAF1-4. These data implicate CG31320/HEATR2 in a growing intracellular pre-assembly and transport network that is necessary to deliver functional dynein machinery to the ciliary compartment for integration into the motile axoneme.

"	"Biopsies from 6 children with clinical presentations suggestive of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) displayed respiratory epithelial cells with disorganized accumulations of basal bodies within the cytoplasm and large intracytoplasmic vesicles into which projected numerous microvilli and cilia. Microvilli, but few cilia, were present at the cell surface. Ultrastructural study revealed a variety of nonspecific abnormalities but demonstrated the cilia generally to be morphologically normal, suggesting that the cause of cilia malfunction was not any recognized primary cause or secondary effect. Repeat studies from 2 patients produced similar findings. It is proposed that this entity, termed ciliary inclusion disease, represents a variant form of PCD manifesting as a consequence of improper ciliogenesis caused by inhibited cytoskeleton-regulated migration of basal bodies to the luminal surface of the airway respiratory epithelial cells.

"	"Patients with congenital heart disease with heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal airway ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide, characteristics associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a reflection of the role of motile cilia in airway clearance and left-right patterning. To assess the potential broader clinical significance of airway ciliary dysfunction in congenital heart disease, we assessed the prevalence of ciliary dysfunction versus respiratory symptoms in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease were recruited (n = 218), 39 with heterotaxy. Nasal nitric oxide measurements and nasal biopsies for ciliary motion video microscopy were conducted. Sinopulmonary symptoms were reviewed by questionnaire. A high prevalence of ciliary motion defects (51.8%) and low or borderline low nasal nitric oxide levels (35.5%) were observed in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with ciliary motion defects or low nasal nitric oxide showed increased sinopulmonary symptoms, with most respiratory symptoms seen in those with both abnormal ciliary motion and low nitric oxide. Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide were more important in determining risk of sinopulmonary symptoms than heterotaxy status. Patients with congenital heart disease without heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide. This was associated with more sinopulmonary symptoms. These findings suggest that patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease and respiratory symptoms may benefit from screening for ciliary dysfunction and implementation of medical interventions to reduce sinopulmonary morbidities.

Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare condition attributed to cilia dysfunction. Murine models of BBS suggest a respiratory phenotype; however, no reports have studied the translation of these findings in patients. We assessed the clinical symptoms of motile cilia dysfunction and the histology of ciliated respiratory epithelium in patients with BBS. We report an increased prevalence of neonatal respiratory distress at birth (12%), general practitioner-diagnosed asthma (21%), otitis media (33%), and rhinitis (36%) in patients with BBS. These symptoms, however, occurred at a significantly reduced prevalence compared with patients with known motile cilia dysfunction (primary ciliary dyskinesia). Respiratory epithelial assessment revealed cellular damage, significant ciliary depletion (on 60% of ciliated cells), and goblet cell hyperplasia in patients with BBS (50% goblet cells). These findings were quantifiably similar to those of patients with asthma (P > .05). Surprisingly, motile cilia function and ultrastructure were grossly normal with the exception of occasional unique inclusions within the ciliary membrane. In conclusion, motile ciliary structure and function are essentially normal in patients with BBS.

In the airways, cilia function in concert with airway mucus to mediate the critical function of mucociliary clearance, cleansing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. The prototypical disorder of respiratory cilia is primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder that leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, to repeated chest infections, and to the progressive destruction of lung architecture. Numerous acquired lung diseases are also marked by abnormalities in both cilia structure and function. In this review we summarize current knowledge regarding airway ciliated cells and cilia, how they function to maintain a healthy epithelium, and how disorders of cilia structure and function contribute to inherited and acquired lung disease.

Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).

Defects manifest by abnormal formation and arrangement of visceral organs. The genetic etiology of defects not associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the cause of situs anomalies, including heterotaxy syndrome and situs inversus totalis, in a consanguineous family. Whole-exome analysis revealed a homozygous deleterious deletion in the WDR16 gene, which segregated with the phenotype. WDR16 protein was previously proposed to play a role in cilia-related signal transduction processes; the rat Wdr16 protein was shown to be confined to cilia-possessing tissues and severe hydrocephalus was observed in the wdr16 gene knockdown zebrafish. The phenotype associated with the homozygous deletion in our patients suggests a role for WDR16 in human laterality patterning. Exome analysis is a valuable tool for molecular investigation even in cases of large deletions.

To investigate technical and practical issues related to TB-nNO methods in children referred for suspected or asserted PCD, we recorded, in a prospective multicenter study, TB-nNO (calculated as the mean of 5 peaks, 10 or 30 sec during tidal breathing) and VC-nNO when available. We studied 142 children (PCD diagnosis asserted in 47, excluded in 39). Nasal NO values were significantly different according to methods, VC-nNO being higher than TB-nNO (TB-nNO 5 peaks higher than mean of 10 or 30 sec). Specificity (90-94%) and sensitivity (86-97%) were similar between TB-nNO and VC-nNO methods. Age was more correlated with VC-nNO than with TB-nNO. TB-nNO could differ between the two nostrils by more than 10% (or 10 ppb when nNO absolute value lower 100 ppb) in 32-43% of the tested children, according to the different tidal breathing values, and was reproducible in the long term but influenced by ambient NO. Despite TB-nNO values being lower than VC-nNO, TB-nNO was found to be as discriminant for PCD, and probably more discriminant in children less than 8 years old, as the VC method. These results were obtained using the chemiluminescence technique which allows an easier assessment of relevant factors such as nasal permeability and ambient NO than the electrochemical technique.

Vitamin D levels were measured in 22 PCD patients (7 females, 10.5 years, range, 2-34 years). In PCD, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), sputum microbiology, self-reported physical activity (PA) level, and quality of life (QoL) by means of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), were also assessed. Seventy-two percent of PCD patients were vitamin-D deficient-to-insufficient and 28% were sufficient. No differences in PFTs parameters were found between vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups. Patients with vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency had significantly higher SGRQ total scores, and thus poorer QoL (p = 0.03). Seventy-nine percent of PCD subjects had limitations in performing vigorous activities, and 53% performed less than 3 hours of PA per week. Vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups did not show any differences in age at PCD diagnosis or at onset of respiratory symptoms, BMI, atopy, current asthma or bronchiectasis. However, 79% of patients with bronchiectasis had vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency. No differences were found in the rate of positive sputum cultures and in the number of antibiotic courses between the two groups. Hypovitaminosis D is common in PCD patients, and is associated with poorer QoL. We recommend the assessment and treatment of hypovitaminosis D to be included in the routine management of PCD.

However, because of this genetic heterogeneity, comprehensive molecular genetic testing is not considered the standard of care, and the most efficient molecular approach has yet to be elucidated. Here, we propose a cost-effective and time-efficient molecular genetic algorithm to solve cases of PCD.

"	"Single incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SILSG) has proven to be a safe minimal invasive procedure. The umbilicus placement of the device allows the avoidance of any visible scars. Kartagener syndrome is a rare genetic disorder (1:15 000) accompanied by the combination of chronic sinusitis/bronchiectasis leading to respiratory insufficiency and situs inversus totalis (SIT) in half of the patients. SIT is a transposition of organs to the opposite side of the body and can lead to difficulties in laparoscopic surgery because of mirror image anatomy modification. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman (122 kg; 1.58 m) with a body mass index of 49 kg/m(2) presenting SIT with chronic respiratory insufficiency as part of Kartagener syndrome. In this multimedia video, we present a step-by-step trans-umbilical SILSG completed in SIT condition. Single site approach allows several technical advantages such as single-port placement, surgeon position as well as surgical instruments manipulation that are unchanged compared to ""normal anatomy patients."" These resulted in limited intra-operative difficulties. No adverse outcomes occurred during the post-operative period. Trans-umbilical SILSG in patients with SIT can be performed safely and in comparable conditions than in normal anatomy patients.

26246169	"Automated identification of abnormal respiratory ciliary motion in nasal biopsies
"	"Motile cilia lining the nasal and bronchial passages beat synchronously to clear mucus and foreign matter from the respiratory tract. This mucociliary defense mechanism is essential for pulmonary health, because respiratory ciliary motion defects, such as those in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or congenital heart disease, can cause severe sinopulmonary disease necessitating organ transplant. The visual examination of nasal or bronchial biopsies is critical for the diagnosis of ciliary motion defects, but these analyses are highly subjective and error-prone. Although ciliary beat frequency can be computed, this metric cannot sensitively characterize ciliary motion defects. Furthermore, PCD can present without any ultrastructural defects, limiting the use of other detection methods, such as electron microscopy. Therefore, an unbiased, computational method for analyzing ciliary motion is clinically compelling. We present a computational pipeline using algorithms from computer vision and machine learning to decompose ciliary motion into quantitative elemental components. Using this framework, we constructed digital signatures for ciliary motion recognition and quantified specific properties of the ciliary motion that allowed high-throughput classification of ciliary motion as normal or abnormal. We achieved >90% classification accuracy in two independent data cohorts composed of patients with congenital heart disease, PCD, or heterotaxy, as well as healthy controls. Clinicians without specialized knowledge in machine learning or computer vision can operate this pipeline as a ""black box"" toolkit to evaluate ciliary motion.

"	"Clinical symptoms in children with pulmonary diseases are frequently non-specific. Rare diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), cystic fibrosis (CF) or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) can be easily missed at the general practitioner (GP). To develop and test a questionnaire-based and data mining-supported tool providing diagnostic support for selected pulmonary diseases. First, interviews with parents of affected children were conducted and analysed. These parental observations during the pre-diagnostic time formed the basis for a new questionnaire addressing the parents' view on the disease. Secondly, parents with a sick child (e.g. PCD, PBB) answered the questionnaire and a data base was set up. Finally, a computer program consisting of eight different classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy rule-based, random forest, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and nearest neighbour) and an ensemble classifier was developed and trained to categorise any given new questionnaire and suggest a diagnosis. For estimating the diagnostic accuracy, we applied ten-fold stratified cross validation. All questionnaires of patients suffering from CF, asthma (AS), PCD, acute bronchitis (AB) and the healthy control group were correctly diagnosed by the fusion algorithm. For the pneumonia (PM) group 19/21 (90.5%) and for the PBB group 17/18 (94.4%) correct diagnoses could be reached. The program detected the correct diagnoses with an overall sensitivity of 98.8%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses confirmed the accuracy of this diagnostic tool. Case studies highlighted the applicability of the tool in the daily work of a GP. For children with symptoms of pulmonary diseases a questionnaire-based diagnostic support tool using data mining techniques exhibited good results in arriving at diagnostic suggestions. In the hands of a doctor, this tool could be of value in arousing awareness for rare pulmonary diseases such as PCD or CF.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial flora in non-chronic and chronic infections in the lower airways of patients with PCD. We retrospectively reviewed the presence of bacteria from patients with PCD during an 11-year period and genotyped 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from 12 patients with chronic infection using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We identified 5450 evaluable cultures from 107 patients with PCD (median age 17 years, range 0-74 years) (median age at diagnosis 7.8 years, range 0-63 years). Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent microorganism. Other common pathogens were P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The number of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa at least once varied from 11 to 44 patients (15-47%) annually, and 42 patients (39%) met the criteria for chronic infection at least once. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated in teenagers and adults than children (p 0.02) and the prevalence was significantly lower in patients with preschool (<6 years) PCD diagnosis (p 0.04). Ten out of 12 patients (83%) were chronically infected with a unique clone-type of P. aeruginosa. No sharing of clone-types or patient-to-patient transmission was observed. In conclusion, PCD patients were infected by a unique set of bacteria acquired in an age-dependent sequence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently colonizes the lower respiratory tract and the incidence of chronic infection was higher than previously reported.

"	"What is the motor protein composition and function of human fallopian tube (FT) cilia? Although the motor protein composition and function of human FT cilia resemble that of respiratory cilia, females with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are not necessarily infertile. FTs are lined with multiple motile cilia, which show a 9 + 2 ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. Case reports suggest an increased incidence of subfertility and ectopic pregnancy in women with PCD, a disease characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. This study consisted of an observational laboratory study on human FT specimens from five healthy females recruited from April 2012 to December 2013 and a descriptive observational retrospective analysis of a clinical PCD database. Human FT tissue was obtained from five healthy females after tubal ligation during caesarean delivery. Motor protein composition was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against dynein arms and nexin-dynein regulatory complex subunits. Ciliary motility was analysed by high-speed video microscopy. A retrospective search of our database of PCD individuals was performed for information on conception and childbirth. The motor protein composition of human FT cilia was identical to that of respiratory cilia. FT cilia showed coordinated beating, resulting in a directed fluid flow towards the uterine cavity. We identified nine PCD individuals with severe dysfunction of respiratory cilia who gave birth to children after spontaneous conception. This suggests that ciliary beating is not the key motor of ovum transport. FT cilia of affected PCD females were not available for analysis. Thus, it remains to be proven that FT cilia indeed show the same defects as respiratory cilia in PCD individuals. Comprehensive epidemiological studies are needed to determine the extent of female (sub-) fertility in PCD. Knowledge of the exact protein composition and function of FT cilia will contribute to a better understanding of cilia-generated fluid flow in female reproduction. These findings are important for subsequent studies of function and protein composition of FT cilia in PCD patients.

Congenital disorders of ciliary beating, referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), are characterized by deficient mucociliary clearance and severe, recurrent respiratory infections. Numerous genetic defects, most of which can be detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are so far known to cause different abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. However, some defects are not regularly discernable by TEM because the ciliary architecture of the axoneme remains preserved. This applies in particular to isolated defects of the nexin links, also known as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), connecting the peripheral outer microtubular doublets. Immunofluorescence analyses of respiratory cells from PCD-affected individuals detected a N-DRC defect. Genome-wide exome sequence analyses identified recessive loss-of-function mutations in GAS8 encoding DRC4 in three independent PCD-affected families.

"	"Gene therapy holds promise to cure a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. Recent successes in recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-based gene therapy in the clinic for hereditary disorders such as Leber's congenital amaurosis and hemophilia B encouraged us to reexplore an rAAV approach for pulmonary gene transfer. Only limited clinical successes have been achieved for airway gene transfer so far, underscoring the need for further preclinical development of rAAV-based gene therapy for pulmonary disorders. We sought to determine the preclinical potential of an airway-tropic serotype, rAAV2/5, encoding reporter genes when delivered to mouse airways. Although several groups have assessed the stability of gene transfer using a nonintegrating rAAV in mouse airways, long-term stability for more than a year has not been reported. Additionally, an extensive quantitative analysis of the specific cell types targeted by rAAV2/5 using cell-specific markers is lacking. We obtained sustained gene expression in upper and lower airways up to 15 months after vector administration, a substantial proportion of the lifespan of a laboratory mouse. In addition, we demonstrated that readministration of rAAV2/5 to the airways is feasible and increases gene expression 14 months after primary vector administration, despite the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies. Finally, identification of transduced cell types revealed different subpopulations being targeted by rAAV2/5, with 64% of β-galactosidase-positive cells being ciliated cells, 34% club cells in the conducting airways, and 75% alveolar type II cells in the alveoli at 1 month postinjection.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare recessive disease with a prevalence of 1/10,000; its symptoms are caused by a kinetic dysfunction of motile cilia in the respiratory epithelium, flagella in spermatozoids, and primary cilia in the embryonic node. PCD is genetically heterogeneous: genotyping the already known PCD-related genes explains the genetic basis in 60-65% of the cases, depending on the population. While identification of new genes involved in PCD pathogenesis remains crucial, the search for new, population-specific mutations causative for PCD is equally important. The Slavs remain far less characterized in this respect compared to West European populations, which significantly limits diagnostic capability. The main goal of this study was to characterize the profile of causative genetic defects in one of the PCD-causing genes, ZMYND10, in the cohort of PCD patients of Slavic origin. The study was carried out using biological material from 172 unrelated PCD individuals of Polish origin, with no causative mutation found in nine major PCD genes. While none of the previously described mutations was found using the HRM-based screening, a novel frameshift mutation (c.367delC) in ZMYND10, unique for Slavic PCD population, was found in homozygous state in two unrelated PCD patients. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms from the ciliary axoneme, consistent with the already published ZMYND10-mutated phenotype; cDNA analysis revealed the lack of ZMYND10 mRNA, indicating nonsense-mediated decay of the truncated transcript.

"	"Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving left-right patterning defects, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a sinopulmonary disease with dyskinetic/immotile cilia in the airway are seemingly disparate diseases. However, they have an overlapping genetic etiology involving mutations in cilia genes, a reflection of the common requirement for motile cilia in left-right patterning and airway clearance. While PCD is a monogenic recessive disorder, heterotaxy has a more complex, largely non-monogenic etiology. In this study, we show mutations in the novel dynein gene DNAH6 can cause heterotaxy and ciliary dysfunction similar to PCD. We provide the first evidence that trans-heterozygous interactions between DNAH6 and other PCD genes potentially can cause heterotaxy. DNAH6 was initially identified as a candidate heterotaxy/PCD gene by filtering exome-sequencing data from 25 heterotaxy patients stratified by whether they have airway motile cilia defects. dnah6 morpholino knockdown in zebrafish disrupted motile cilia in Kupffer's vesicle required for left-right patterning and caused heterotaxy with abnormal cardiac/gut looping. Similarly DNAH6 shRNA knockdown disrupted motile cilia in human and mouse respiratory epithelia. Notably a heterotaxy patient harboring heterozygous DNAH6 mutation was identified to also carry a rare heterozygous PCD-causing DNAI1 mutation, suggesting a DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interaction. Furthermore, sequencing of 149 additional heterotaxy patients showed 5 of 6 patients with heterozygous DNAH6 mutations also had heterozygous mutations in DNAH5 or other PCD genes. We functionally assayed for DNAH6/DNAH5 and DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interactions using subthreshold double-morpholino knockdown in zebrafish and showed this caused heterotaxy. Similarly, subthreshold siRNA knockdown of Dnah6 in heterozygous Dnah5 or Dnai1 mutant mouse respiratory epithelia disrupted motile cilia function. Together, these findings support an oligogenic disease model with broad relevance for further interrogating the genetic etiology of human ciliopathies.

Diagnostic tests, including ultrastructural analysis of cilia, nasal nitric oxide measurements, and molecular testing for mutations in PCD genes, have inherent limitations. To define a statistically valid combination of systematically defined clinical features that strongly associates with PCD in children and adolescents. Investigators at seven North American sites in the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium prospectively and systematically assessed individuals (aged 0-18 yr) referred due to high suspicion for PCD. The investigators defined specific clinical questions for the clinical report form based on expert opinion. Diagnostic testing was performed using standardized protocols and included nasal nitric oxide measurement, ciliary biopsy for ultrastructural analysis of cilia, and molecular genetic testing for PCD-associated genes. Final diagnoses were assigned as ""definite PCD"" (hallmark ultrastructural defects and/or two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), ""probable/possible PCD"" (no ultrastructural defect or genetic diagnosis, but compatible clinical features and nasal nitric oxide level in PCD range), and ""other diagnosis or undefined."" Criteria were developed to define early childhood clinical features on the basis of responses to multiple specific queries. Each defined feature was tested by logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to define the most robust set of clinical features associated with PCD. From 534 participants 18 years of age and younger, 205 were identified as having ""definite PCD"" (including 164 with two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), 187 were categorized as ""other diagnosis or undefined,"" and 142 were defined as having ""probable/possible PCD."" Participants with ""definite PCD"" were compared with the ""other diagnosis or undefined"" group.

FEV1 was associated with gender (regression coefficient for men =13.8, p=0.009), chest CT score (r=-0.42, p<0.001) but not with age at diagnosis, SI or body mass index. FEV1 decline was -13.4 mL/year (-42.8; +11.9) and was greater in women (-29.3 mL/year, (-59.7; -11.9), vs -2.0 mL/year (-26.9; +25.4), p=0.002). Three patients had severe respiratory failure. Alteration of respiratory function in adults with PCD is heterogeneous and usually moderate but appears more severe in women and in patients with chronic PA infection. Only 4% of patients develop chronic respiratory failure.

27435107	"Contribution of mucus concentration and secreted mucins Muc5ac and Muc5b to the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive lung disease
"	"Airway diseases, including cigarette smoke-induced chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary dyskinesia are associated with decreased mucociliary clearance (MCC). However, it is not known whether a simple reduction in MCC or concentration-dependent mucus adhesion to airway surfaces dominates disease pathogenesis or whether decreasing the concentration of secreted mucins may be therapeutic. To address these questions, Scnn1b-Tg mice, which exhibit airway mucus dehydration/adhesion, were compared and crossed with Muc5b- and Muc5ac-deficient mice. Absence of Muc5b caused a 90% reduction in MCC, whereas Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited an ∼50% reduction. However, the degree of MCC reduction did not correlate with bronchitic airway pathology, which was observed only in Scnn1b-Tg mice. Ablation of Muc5b significantly reduced the extent of mucus plugging in Scnn1b-Tg mice. However, complete absence of Muc5b in Scnn1b-Tg mice was associated with increased airway inflammation, suggesting that Muc5b is required to maintain immune homeostasis. Loss of Muc5ac had few phenotypic consequences in Scnn1b-Tg mice. These data suggest that: (i) mucus hyperconcentration dominates over MCC reduction alone to produce bronchitic airway pathology; (ii) Muc5b is the dominant contributor to the Scnn1b-Tg phenotype; and (iii) therapies that limit mucin secretion may reduce plugging, but complete Muc5b removal from airway surfaces may be detrimental.

27450411	"Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections, through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease. There are no available data on disease-specific pediatric patient-reported outcomes. Our objective was to create developmentally appropriate, health-related quality-of-life questionnaires (QOL-PCD) for children (6-12 yr) and adolescents (13-17 yr) with PCD and a parent proxy measure. The QOL-PCD was developed using a cross-cultural protocol-driven approach satisfying both North American and European drug regulatory agency guidelines. A conceptual framework was generated by literature review, focus groups (expert clinicians and patients/parents), and open-ended interviews with children, adolescents, and parents of patients with PCD. We recruited participants from international research consortiums, PCD clinics, and patient advocacy groups, aiming for representation of a wide spectrum of disease severity, sociodemographic status, and ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained and experienced research assistants and psychologists. Transcripts were content-analyzed with Atlas.ti/NVivo to assess saturation of content. A self-completed item relevance survey was administered to E.U. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to construct draft instruments. Questionnaires were further refined after cognitive interviews. Focus groups (n = 62 experts; n = 20 patients/parents) and open-ended interviews with patients/parents (n = 69; 34 males; age at diagnosis, 0-15 yr; FEV1, 58-118% predicted) revealed a wide spectrum of issues unique to this population. Content analysis of transcripts identified the following domains, depending on age: Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Treatment Burden, Ears and Hearing, Sinus Symptoms, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, School Functioning, and Eating and Weight. Various items were retained in questionnaires, based on age and role of respondent: 37, 43, and 41 items for children, adolescents, and parent proxy, respectively. The item relevance survey (n = 57) yielded results similar to those of open-ended interviews. Cognitive testing (n = 47; 20 males; age at diagnosis, 0-11 yr; FEV1, 49-124% predicted) confirmed that items and response choices were clear and understood by respondents, and that all relevant items were included. The QOL-PCD measures, developed using rigorous, protocol-driven methods and international collaborations, have demonstrated content validity and cross-cultural equivalence for implementation in English-speaking populations. Psychometric testing is underway to determine their measurement properties for evaluating clinical interventions and informing quality of care.

"	"Translational readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) induced by pharmacological compounds has proven to be an effective way of restoring functional protein expression and reducing symptoms in several genetic disorders. We tested the potential of different concentrations of several aminoglycosides (AAGs) for promoting PTC-readthrough in 5 genes involved in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder caused by the dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. The efficiency of readthrough stimulation of PTCs cloned in dual reporter vectors was examined in 2 experimental settings: in vitro (transcription/translation system) and ex vivo (transiently transfected epithelial cell line). PTC-readthrough was observed in 5 of the 16 mutations analyzed. UGA codons were more susceptible to AAG-stimulated readthrough than UAG; no suppression of UAA was observed. The efficiency of PTC-readthrough in vitro (from less than 1% to ∼28% of the translation from the corresponding wild-type constructs) differed with the AAG type and concentration, and depended on the combination of AAG and PTC, indicating that each PTC has to be individually tested with a range of stimulating compounds. The maximal values of PTC suppression observed in the ex vivo experiments were, depending on AAG used, 3-5 times lower than the corresponding values in vitro, despite using AAG concentrations that were 2 orders of magnitude higher. This indicates that, while the in vitro system is sufficient to examine the readthrough-susceptibility of PTCs, it is not sufficient to test the compounds potential to stimulate PTC-readthrough in the living cells. Most of the tested compounds (except for G418) at their highest concentrations did not disturb ciliogenesis in the cultures of primary respiratory epithelial cells from healthy donors.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, mostly autosomal-recessive disorder of motile cilia, characterized by chronic lung disease, rhinosinusitis, hearing impairment, and subfertility. PCD is still often missed or diagnosed late since symptoms overlap with common respiratory complaints, but should be considered if one or more of the cardinal clues are present. Areas covered: We provide an overview on clinical presentations of PCD and clues for when to consider PCD, these include unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, persistent rhinitis from the first days of life, situs anomalies, or otorrhoea following tympanostomy tube insertion. Diagnosis is on the basis of clinical suspicion, and an algorithm of nasal nitric oxide, ciliary beat pattern and frequency, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence of ciliary proteins and genetic studies. However, there is no one gold-standard test as yet. We reviewed the current literature based on PubMed and Ovid databases literature search. Expert commentary: There is a need for increased awareness about PCD beyond specialist respiratory clinicians and a need for standardization of PCD diagnostics internationally. Early diagnosis means that inappropriate treatment based on misdiagnosed conditions can be avoided, and the onset of bronchiectasis may be delayed.

"	"Cilia are cell surface organelles with key roles in a range of cellular processes, including generation of fluid flow by motile cilia. The axonemes of motile cilia and immotile kinocilia contain 9 peripheral microtubule doublets, a central microtubule pair, and 9 connecting radial spokes. Aberrant radial spoke components RSPH1, 3, 4a and 9 have been linked with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by ciliary dysmotility; yet, radial spoke functions remain unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Rsph9 is expressed in cells bearing motile cilia and kinocilia, and localizes to both 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. Using CRISPR mutagenesis, we show that rsph9 is required for motility of presumptive 9 + 2 olfactory cilia and, unexpectedly, 9 + 0 neural cilia. rsph9 is also required for the structural integrity of 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. rsph9 mutant larvae exhibit reduced initiation of the acoustic startle response consistent with hearing impairment, suggesting a novel role for Rsph9 in the kinocilia of the inner ear and/or lateral line neuromasts. These data identify novel roles for Rsph9 in 9 + 0 motile cilia and in sensory kinocilia, and establish a useful zebrafish PCD model.

Of the 203 patients recruited from 14 pediatric centers, 150 had a PCD diagnosis verified. Median age was 15.05y, with range 0.15-60.5y. PCD prevalence was 1:54,000 for the general population and 1:25,000 in children (5-14 y). For the non-Jewish (mainly Druze and Arab Moslem) compared to Jewish populations, prevalence was 1:16,500 and 1:139,000 respectively (p < 0.0001) and parental consanguinity was 85.4% and 21.9% respectively (p < 0.0001). Clinical features included bronchiectasis (88%), rhinitis (81%), recurrent pneumonia (78%), recurrent otitis (62%), neonatal pneumonia (60%) and situs inversus (42%). Prior diagnostic practices varied widely between centers with TEM assessed in 55% and abnormal in 61% of these. Management included antibiotics and airway clearance. Diagnostic verification revealed for 150 PCD patients: 81% nNO<233 ppb, 62% abnormal HVMA, 51% diagnostic TEM, 58% diagnostic IF and, 57% genetic diagnosis. PCD in Israel is rare, with comprehensive diagnostic tests showing prevalence in children similar to Europe. Prevalence was higher in non-Jews, associated with parental consanguinity.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by structural and/or functional impairment of cilia throughout the whole body. Early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long‑term sequelae, however early diagnosis is a challenge due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD. In the current study, the patient with PCD was diagnosed at nine years old following several efforts to control intractable airway symptoms. The patient experienced a chronic productive cough beginning in early childhood and had multiple episodes of pneumonia and otitis media with effusion and sinusitis. No situs inversus or other heterotaxias were reported. Serial chest X‑rays exhibited persistent atelectasis and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe. When the patient was nine years old, electron microscopy of his cilia and genetic analysis were conducted. Electron microscopy of a biopsy specimen from the nasal mucosa indicated loss of the outer dynein arms. Whole‑exome analysis of the genome demonstrated the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5: NM_001369.2:c.5983C>T, p.Arg1995X in exon 36 and NM_001369.2:c.9101delG, p.Gly3034ValfsX22 in exon 54; neither of which have been previously reported in the literature in a Japanese patient.

The BRR is a database of patients with non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) enrolled at 13 sites in the United States. Baseline demographic, spirometric, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data were entered into a central Internet-based database. Patients were subsequently analyzed by the presence of NTM. We enrolled 1,826 patients between 2008 and 2014. Patients were predominantly women (79%), white (89%), and never smokers (60%), with a mean age of 64 ± 14 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients had a history of NTM disease or NTM isolated at baseline evaluation for entry into the BRR. Patients with NTM were older, predominantly women, and had bronchiectasis diagnosed at a later age than those without NTM. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was more common in those with NTM, whereas asthma, primary immunodeficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia were more common in those without NTM. Fifty-one percent of patients had spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction. Patients with NTM were more likely to have diffusely dilated airways and tree-in-bud abnormalities. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were cultured less commonly in patients with NTM. Bronchial hygiene measures were used more often in those with NTM, whereas antibiotics used for exacerbations, rotating oral antibiotics, steroid use, and inhaled bronchodilators were more commonly used in those without NTM. Adult patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the US BRR are described, with differences noted in demographic, radiographic, microbiological, and treatment variables based on stratification of the presence of NTM.

"	"Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of primary airway epithelial cells enables mucociliary differentiation providing an in vitro model of the human airway, but their proliferative potential is limited. To extend proliferation, these cells were previously transduced with viral oncogenes or mouse Bmi-1 + hTERT, but the resultant cell lines did not undergo mucociliary differentiation. We hypothesized that use of human BMI-1 alone would increase the proliferative potential of bronchial epithelial cells while retaining their mucociliary differentiation potential. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells were transduced by lentivirus with BMI-1 and then their morphology, replication kinetics, and karyotype were assessed. When differentiated at ALI, mucin production, ciliary function, and transepithelial electrophysiology were measured. Finally, shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells was used to model primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). BMI-1-transduced basal cells showed normal cell morphology, karyotype, and doubling times despite extensive passaging. The cell lines underwent mucociliary differentiation when cultured at ALI with abundant ciliation and production of the gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B evident. Cilia displayed a normal beat frequency and 9+2 ultrastructure. Electrophysiological characteristics of BMI-1-transduced cells were similar to those of untransduced cells. shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells produced immotile cilia and absence of DNAH5 in the ciliary axoneme as seen in cells from patients with PCD. BMI-1 delayed senescence in bronchial epithelial cells, increasing their proliferative potential but maintaining mucociliary differentiation at ALI. We have shown these cells are amenable to genetic manipulation and can be used to produce novel disease models for research and dissemination.

It belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as primary ciliopathies, which includes autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney diseases, as well as Joubert and Bardet-Biedl syndromes. Prior studies have suggested phenotypic overlap between primary ciliopathies affecting the non-motile, sensory cilia, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a motile ciliopathy characterized by respiratory tract disease. We describe the burden of oto-sino-pulmonary disease in 38 individuals with AS and examines the degree of clinical overlap between PCD and AS. Evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center included clinical examination, chest imaging, and clinical history surveys, as well as measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in nine patients. Recurrent otitis media was ubiquitous in the AS cohort (92%) with 50% requiring pressure equalization tube placement. A history of bronchitis/pneumonia and sinusitis was reported in 61% and 50% of individuals, respectively. PCD-characterizing symptoms (laterality defects, unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion, and wet cough) were far less prevalent in the AS cohort compared to PCD, and the average nNO production in the AS cohort was 232 ± 57.1 nl/min compared to a cut-off of <77 nl/min for PCD. These data suggest that the oto-sino-respiratory complications in AS are prominent enough to warrant increased clinical attention, but significantly impaired respiratory cilia function as seen in PCD is unlikely in AS.

Multitrait analysis was used to evaluate how the items loaded on 10 hypothesised scales: physical, emotional, role and social functioning, treatment burden, vitality, health perceptions, upper respiratory symptoms, lower respiratory symptoms and ears and hearing symptoms. This analysis of item-to-total correlations led to 9 items being dropped; the validated measure now comprises 40 items. Each scale had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.74 to 0.94). Two-week test-retest demonstrated stability for all scales (intraclass coefficients 0.73 to 0.96). Significant correlations were obtained between QOL-PCD scores and age and FEV1. Strong relationships were also found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, lower respiratory symptoms and SGRQ-C (r=0.72, p<0.001), while weak correlations were found between measures of different constructs.

To evaluate whether they are important in the pathophysiology of primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, SCD). We measured sputum bacteriology, lung CT changes, MMPs, TIMPs and lung function in 86 patients (51 PCD, 35 SCD) in a cross-sectional study; the 10 controls studied did not have HRCT or sputum cultures. MMPs, TIMPs and lung function were evaluated longitudinally for up to one year in 38 PCD patients. At baseline, there were no differences in MMPs, TIMPs and MMPs/TIMPs, between PCD and SCD but lower levels were found in controls. There was an association between poorer lung function with increasing levels of MMPs in PCD, while in SCD only MMP-9/TIMP-1 values correlated with FRC z-scores. Levels of MMPs and TIMPs significantly correlated with severity HRCT changes. Longitudinally, there were significant correlations between slope of changes in spirometric parameters and slope of change in sputum MMPs in PCD patients. In conclusion, we report for the first time that increased MMPs are associated with worse airway damage in PCD and SCD, and thus are potential therapeutic targets.

Three-dimensional explant spheroid formation was initiated in the same individual on the same day by incubation of cells and sheets from a separate brush biopsy. Harvested spheroids were analyzed earliest possible and values of spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were compared to the corresponding reference values from day 1. Spheroids formed fast in serum-free culture medium. Formation was successful in 15 out of 18 (82%) sampled individuals. Thus, formation was successful in seven healthy controls and eight PCD patients, while unsuccessful in 3 with PCD due to infection. Median (range) number of days in culture before harvesting of spheroids was 4 (1-5) in healthy versus 2 (1-5) in PCD. Spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were unchanged compared to their corresponding day 1 standard reference values. Spheroid ciliary beat frequency discriminated highly significant between healthy controls (9.3 Hz) and PCD patients (2.4 Hz) (P < 0.0001). Survival of spheroids was 16 days in a single healthy person. Patient-specific three-dimensional explant spheroid formation from a minimal invasive nasal brush biopsy is a feasible, fast and valid ex vivo method to assess ciliary function with potential of aiding the diagnosis of PCD. In addition, it may be a useful model in the investigation of pathophysiological aspects and drug effects in human nasal airway epithelium.

28403885	"Lung structure and function similarities between primary ciliary dyskinesia and mild cystic fibrosis: a pilot study
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are increasingly compared. There are no chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comparative studies of PCD and CF. We assessed clinical, functional, microbiological and MRI findings in PCD and mild CF patients in order to evaluate different expression of lung disease. Twenty PCD (15.1 years) and 20 CF subjects with mild respiratory impairment (16 years, 70% with pancreatic insufficiency) underwent MRI, spirometry, and sputum cultures when clinically stable. MRI was scored using the modified Helbich system. PCD was diagnosed later than CF (9.9 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.03), despite earlier symptoms (0.1 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.02). In the year preceding the study, patients from both groups underwent two systemic antibiotic courses (p = 0.48). MRI total scores were 11.6 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 1 in PCD and CF, respectively. FEV1 and FVC Z-scores were -1.75 (range, -4.6-0.7) and -0.6 (-3.9-1.8) in PCD, and -0.9 (range, -5.4-2.3) and -0.3 (-3.4-2.5) in CF, respectively. No difference was found between lung function or structure, despite a higher MRI subscore of collapse/consolidation in PCD versus CF (1.6 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed after data-control for diagnostic delay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more frequent in CF than in PCD (p = 0.05 and p = 0.003, respectively). MRI is a valuable radiation-free tool for comparative PCD and CF lung disease assessment. Patients with PCD may exhibit similar MRI and lung function changes as CF subjects with mild pulmonary disease. Delay in PCD diagnosis is unlikely the only determinant of similarities.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital disorder involving permanent ubiquitous structural and/or functional ciliary abnormalities. A single-center retrospective study included 56 cases of PCD (respiratory form) out of a cohort of 280 patients with suspected PCD. The main features of history-taking and clinical examination were analyzed, to formulate a pragmatic diagnostic procedure, easy to implement in clinical practice. Chronic respiratory tract infectious symptoms are sensitive but non-specific for the diagnosis of PCD. Nasal brushing for phase-contrast microscopy study of ciliary morphology and activity proved to be a fast, easy, non-invasive, cost-effective and age-independent diagnostic method. In doubtful cases, depending on local availability, further tests are indicated: nasal nitric oxide level, electronic microscopy, genetic study and cell culture. In suspected PCD, there being no gold standard method of screening and early diagnosis, nasal brushing with ciliary study is contributive, alongside numerous other complementary tests, on condition that the clinician is experienced and results are interpreted in the light of clinical examination and history-taking.

"	"Nitric oxide (NO) can be used to detect respiratory or ciliary diseases. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement can reflect ongoing eosinophilic airway inflammation and has a diagnostic utility as a test for asthma screening and follow-up while nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is a valuable screening tool for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. The possibility of collecting airway gas samples in an offline manner offers the advantage to extend these measures and improve the screening and management of these diseases, but normal values from healthy children and teens remain sparse. Samples were consecutively collected using the offline method for eNO and nNO chemiluminescence measurement in 88 and 31 healthy children and teens, respectively. Offline eNO measurement was also performed in 30 consecutive children with naïve asthma and/or respiratory allergy. The normal offline eNO value was determined by the following regression equation -8.206 + 0.176 × height. The upper limit of the norm for the offline eNO value was 27.4 parts per billion (ppb). A separate analysis was performed in children, pre-teens and teens, for which offline eNO was 13.6 ± 4.7 ppb, 16.3 ± 13.7 ppb and 20.0 ± 7.2 ppb, respectively. The optimal cut-off value of the offline eNO to predict asthma or respiratory allergies was 23.3 ppb, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 91%, respectively. Mean offline nNO was determined at 660 ppb with the lower limit of the norm at 197 ppb. The use of offline eNO and nNO normal values should favour the widespread screening of respiratory diseases in children of school age in their usual environment.

A 36-year-old nonsmoking Chinese man present to the emergency department of our hospital with acute-onset breathlessness and sudden-onset left-sided chest pain. The patient had 6 years primary infertility and suffered from recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections since childhood. Chest X-ray was performed, which showed a left-sided pneumothorax with lung collapse. His conditions improved in clinical symptoms after 3 days of closed thoracic drainage. Radiographic findings after lung recruitment revealed bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis but no situs inversus. Paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) showed maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinusitis. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated severe obstructive ventilation functional impairment. Bronchial mucosal cilia showed the absence of both outer and inner dynein arms of the microtubules (ODA and IDA). A culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. His clinical symptoms and CT images showed improvement after 1 month of treatment. A literature review revealed that few patients are diagnosed with PCD complicated with spontaneous pneumothorax. Within one year of follow-up, the patient showed good responses to local ICS+ LA beta2 agonist combined with oral carbocistein. Pneumothorax might be one of the complications of the PCD. Combination therapy including ICS+ LA beta2 agonist and carbocistein could be a potential therapy to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and delay progression of PCD.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is clinically characterized by neonatal respiratory distress, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and infertility, and situs inversus in 50% of the patients. PCD is a result of mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in ciliary function, and is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Diagnosis of PCD is often a challenging task due to its high clinical and genetic heterogeneities. In the present study, we attempted to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with runs of homozygosity (ROH) approaches to identify the genetic defects in four Chinese consanguineous families with clinical PCD. We successfully identified three recently acknowledged PCD genes: DYX1C1, CCNO and ARMC4, and one well-characterized PCD gene, DNAI1. Our study provides compelling evidence that WES in combination with ROH analysis is an efficient diagnostic tool for identifying genetic causes of PCD in consanguineous families. Furthermore, our work expands the genetic mutation spectrum in PCD, and provides the additional tools to better serve the counseling of the families with PCD.

28922052	"Applications of emerging transmission electron microscopy technology in PCD research and diagnosis
"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia. Patients suffer from chronic infection and inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Diagnosis of PCD is confirmed by identification of a hallmark defect of ciliary ultrastructure or by identification of biallelic pathogenic mutations in a known PCD gene. Since the first description of PCD in 1976, assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been central to diagnosis and research. Electron tomography is a technique whereby a series of transmission electron micrographs are collected at different angles and reconstructed into a single 3D model of a specimen. Electron tomography provides improved spatial information and resolution compared to a single micrograph. Research by electron tomography has revealed new insight into ciliary ultrastructure and consequently ciliary function at a molecular and cellular level. Gene discovery studies in PCD have utilized electron tomography to define the structural consequences of variants in cilia genes. Modern transmission electron microscopes capable of electron tomography are increasingly being installed in clinical laboratories. This presents the possibility for the use of tomography technique in a diagnostic setting. This review describes the electron tomography technique, the contribution tomography has made to the understanding of basic cilia structure and function and finally the potential of the technique for use in PCD diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is predominantly an autosomal recessively inherited condition that affects ~1 in 15,000 people. Diagnosis of PCD can be complex and is ordinarily based on the results of multiple investigations. These investigations include nasal nitric oxide, high-speed video microscopy, genotyping, and electron microscopy analysis of ciliary ultrastructure. A diagnosis is ultimately confirmed by the presence of a hallmark defect identified by transmission electron microscopy or biallelic variants in a known PCD gene. Secondary ciliary defects are commonly seen in samples submitted for diagnosis of PCD. Acquired secondary ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities, which are not caused by a variant in a ciliary gene, are usually transient and reversible however failure to separate primary versus secondary defects can lead to misdiagnosis. In this review, we describe causes of secondary ciliary defects, identify the ultrastructural appearances associated with secondary ciliary dyskinesia and finally suggest methods to avoid misdiagnosis of PCD due to these acquired ciliary defects.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by functional impairment of cilia throughout the body. The early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long-term sequelae; however, this is often challenging because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD and difficulty in genetic analysis. The majority of PCD patients in Japan are not diagnosed properly. To diagnose PCD more accurately, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. We examined 46 patients (age range, 1-64 years; 23 male and 23 female) who were clinically suspected of PCD. First, mutation hotspots in DNAH5 and DNAI1 were sequenced by the Sanger method. Next, exome sequencing was performed in 32 known PCD genes using our novel NGS panel with the Ion Torrent PGM system. Variant annotation was generated by Ion Reporter Version 5.0 (Life Technologies). Mutations found in the panel were validated by Sanger sequencing. Disease-causing gene mutations were found in 10 patients from 7 families: DNAH5 in 4 families, and DNAI1, CCDC40, and RSPH4A in 1 family each. Heterozygous mutations were found in 1 patient. The majority of the mutations found in the present analysis were novel. Japanese PCD patients have novel mutations in cilia-related genes. This targeted NGS panel can identify disease-causing mutations in patients with PCD.

"	"Few studies have examined the potentially therapeutic effect of increasing the production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. Nasal NO is low in PCD and has been found to correlate with compromised Ciliary Beat Frequency (CBF). In this study we assessed the effect of increasing l-Arginine, as the substrate of NO synthases, on CBF in biopsies of human respiratory ciliated epithelium. A total of 28 suspect cases with chronic respiratory manifestations referred for PCD diagnostic testing and 8 healthy controls underwent nasal brushing. Obtained epithelial cells were divided between three culture medium 199 solutions, containing different levels of l-Arginine (0.33 mM as baseline, 1 mM and 10 Mm as increased levels). CBF measurements were obtained at 37 °C and 25 °C at 1, 3 and 24 h after sample acquisition. Among a total of 36 recruited subjects, 8 had PCD confirmed (PCD n = 8), 20 had PCD excluded (non-PCD n = 20) and 8 were healthy controls (Healthy Controls = 8). Among PCD subjects, ciliary motility was characterized by rotational (n = 5) or dyskinetic (n = 3) beating. At 37 °C, compared to baseline, higher levels of l-Arginine resulted in up to 9% CBF increase at 1 h (p = 0.007), up to 9% CBF increase at 3 h (p < 0.001) and up to 12% CBF increase at 24 h (p = 0.002). Similar although smaller scale increases were recorded at 25 °C. The effect of l-Arginine was time dependent (interaction p = 0.002) and was similar in PCD patients, non-PCD chronic respiratory patients and healthy controls (interaction p = 0.800). l-Arginine increases CBF and merits to be evaluated as a potential stimulator of mucociliary clearance in chronic respiratory conditions and congenital ciliary disorders with residual motility. Larger human studies are needed to confirm these findings.

"	"Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) suffer from recurrent upper and lower airway infections due to defects in the cilia present on the respiratory epithelium. Since chronic inflammatory conditions can cause changes in innate immune responses, we investigated whether monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of pediatric PCD patients respond differently to inflammatory stimuli, compared to monocytes from healthy children and adults. The receptor for C5a (C5aR) was upregulated in PCD, whereas expression levels of the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, BLT1 and FPR1 on PCD monocytes were similar to those on monocytes from healthy individuals. Also in vitro migration of PCD monocytes towards the ligands of those receptors (CCL2, fMLP, C5a and LTB4) was normal. Compared to healthy children, PCD patients had a higher percentage of the non-classic monocyte subset (CD14+CD16++) in circulation. Finally, PCD monocytes produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL18 and CCL22) in response to LPS, peptidoglycan and/or dsRNA stimulation. These data suggest that monocytes might exacerbate inflammatory reactions in PCD patients and might maintain a positive feedback-loop feeding the inflammatory process.

These manifestations suggested dysfunction of both primary and motile cilia, respectively. Targeted exome sequencing identified biallelic mutations in WDR19, encoding an IFT-A subunit previously associated with MZSDS-related chondrodysplasia, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia and cranioectodermal dysplasia, linked to primary cilia dysfunction, and in TEKT1 which encodes tektin-1 an uncharacterized member of the tektin family, mutations of which may cause ciliary dyskinesia. Tektin-1 localizes at the centrosome in cycling cells, at basal bodies of both primary and motile cilia and to the axoneme of motile cilia in airway cells. The identified mutations impaired these localizations. In addition, airway cells from the affected individual showed severe motility defects without major ultrastructural changes. Knockdown of tekt1 in zebrafish resulted in phenotypes consistent with a function for tektin-1 in ciliary motility, which was confirmed by live imaging. Finally, experiments in the zebrafish also revealed a synergistic effect of tekt1 and wdr19. Altogether, our data show genetic interactions between WDR19 and TEKT1 likely contributing to the overall clinical phenotype observed in the affected individual and provide strong evidence for TEKT1 as a new candidate gene for primary ciliary dyskinesia.

"	"The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) plays a central role in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. In most species, the N-DRC contains at least 11 subunits, but the specific function of each subunit is unknown. Mutations in three subunits (DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, DRC4/GAS8) have been linked to defects in ciliary motility in humans and lead to a ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Here we characterize the biochemical, structural, and motility phenotypes of two mutations in the DRC2 gene of Chlamydomonas Using high-resolution proteomic and structural approaches, we find that the C-terminal region of DRC2 is critical for the coassembly of DRC2 and DRC1 to form the base plate of N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubule. Loss of DRC2 in drc2 mutants disrupts the assembly of several other N-DRC subunits and also destabilizes the assembly of several closely associated structures such as the inner dynein arms, the radial spokes, and the calmodulin- and spoke-associated complex.

Height was reduced compared to WHO (z-score -0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) and national references (z-score -0.27, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.21) in male and female patients in all age groups, with variation between countries. Height and BMI were higher in patients diagnosed earlier in life (p=0.026 and p<0.001, respectively) and closely associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity z-scores (p<0.001).Our study indicates that both growth and nutrition are affected adversely in PCD patients from early life and are both strongly associated with lung function.

A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed.

29320622	"Kartagener’s syndrome: A case report
"	"Kartagener’s syndrome is a recessive autosomal disease which is mainly seen to affect ciliary movement. The symptoms of the syndrome are the consequence of the defective motility of the cilia found in the respiratory tract and that results with recurrent lung infections caused by mucus stasis in the bronchi. A 37-year-old married, male father of one child, presented with a history of productive cough, wheezing, dispnea, headache, temporary fever. In his 9th year of age, 1986, situs inversus, sinusitis and pectus excavatum were diagnosed. In 1994 he was operated for correction of pectus excavatum. Bronchial asthma was diagnosed in 2008 when he was 31. In the last 2 years he had episodes of breathlessness, wheezing, cough, expectoration, headache, fever and fast declining lung function. The patient was treated with combination of inhaled bronchodilatators (inhaled corticosteroids + long-acting β-2 agonist), and occasional administration of antibiotics, oral prednisolone, mucolytics in episodes of exacerbations of disease over a period of 7−14 days. Treatment for patients with this syndrome has not been established yet, but it is important to control chronic lung infections and prevent declining of lung function.

29322037	"Persistent Bacterial Bronchitis: Time to Venture beyond the Umbrella
"	"Chronic cough in children is common and frequently mismanaged. In the past, cough was diagnosed as asthma and inappropriate asthma therapies prescribed and escalated. It has been realized that persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of wet cough and responds to oral antibiotics. The initial definition comprised a history of chronic wet cough, positive bronchoalveolar (BAL) cultures for a respiratory pathogen and response to a 2-week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This is now termed PBB-micro; PBB-clinical eliminates the need for BAL. PBB-extended is PBB-micro or PBB-clinical but resolution necessitating 4 weeks of antibiotics; and recurrent PBB is >3 attacks of PBB-micro or-clinical/year. However, the airway has only a limited range of responses to chronic inflammation and infection, and neutrophilic airway disease is seen in many other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, both chronic suppurative lung disease endotypes, whose recognition has led to huge scientific and clinical advances. There is an urgent need to extend endotyping into PBB, especially PBB-recurrent. We need to move from associative studies and, in particular, deploy sophisticated modern -omics technologies and systems biology, rather as has been done in the context of asthma in U-BIOPRED. In summary, the use of the term PBB has done signal service in pointing us away from prescribing asthma therapies to children with infected airways, but we now need to move beyond a simple description to teasing out underlying endotypes.

29339787	"Cilia-related protein SPEF2 regulates osteoblast differentiation
"	"Sperm flagellar protein 2 (SPEF2) is essential for motile cilia, and lack of SPEF2 function causes male infertility and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia are pointing out from the cell surface and are involved in signal transduction from extracellular matrix, fluid flow and motility. It has been shown that cilia and cilia-related genes play essential role in commitment and differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts during bone formation. Here we show that SPEF2 is expressed in bone and cartilage. The analysis of a Spef2 knockout (KO) mouse model revealed hydrocephalus, growth retardation and death prior to five weeks of age. To further elucidate the causes of growth retardation we analyzed the bone structure and possible effects of SPEF2 depletion on bone formation. In Spef2 KO mice, long bones (tibia and femur) were shorter compared to wild type, and X-ray analysis revealed reduced bone mineral content. Furthermore, we showed that the in vitro differentiation of osteoblasts isolated from Spef2 KO animals was compromised. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel function for SPEF2 in bone formation through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone growth.

"	"The association of bronchiectasis with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been reported. However, apart from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), predisposing conditions have not been established. We aimed to define clinical and laboratory features that differentiate patients with bronchiectasis with upper airway symptoms (UASs) and without PCD from patients without UASs. We reviewed charts of adults with bronchiectasis, excluding CF and PCD. UASs were defined as nasal discharge most days of the year, sinusitis or nasal polyps. Laboratory data included IgG, total IgE, blood eosinophils, sputum bacteriology and lung function. A radiologist blinded to UAS presence scored bronchiectasis (Reiff score) and sino-nasal pathology (Lund-Mackay score). Of 197 patients, for the 70 (35%) with UASs, symptoms started earlier (34±25 versus 46±24 years; p=0.001), disease duration was longer (median 24 versus 12 years; p=0.027), exacerbations were more frequent (median 3 versus 2 per year; p=0.14), and peripheral blood eosinophil (median 230 versus 200 μL-1; p=0.015) and total IgE (median 100 versus 42 IU·mL-1; p=0.085) levels were higher. The sinus computed tomography score was independently associated with exacerbations, with 1 point on the Lund-Mackay score associated with a 1.03-fold increase in the number of exacerbations per year (95% CI 1.0-1.05; p=0.004). These findings may implicate a higher disease burden in patients with UASs. We hypothesise that UASs precede and may in some cases lead to the development of bronchiectasis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) both entail bronchiectasis and pulmonary impairment as measured using spirometry, during childhood. We aimed at looking whether blood gas exchanges progressed differently between CF and PCD children in a retrospective study of repeated measurements. Comparisons between groups (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests) and a mixed linear model, adjusted for age, evaluated associations between diseases and PaO2, PaCO2, or PaO2-PaCO2 ratio. Among 42 PCD and 73 CF children, 62% and 59% had respectively bronchiectasis (P = 0.75). Spirometry and blood gases were similar at inclusion (PaO2 median [IQR] PCD -1.80 [-3.40; -0.40]; CF -1.80 [-4.20; 0.60] z-scores; P = 0.72). PaO2 and PaO2-PaCO2 ratio similarly and significantly decreased with age in both groups (P < 0.01) whereas PaCO2 increased more in CF (P = 0.02) remaining within the range of normal (except for one child). To conclude, gas exchange characteristics, similarly initially impaired in PCD and CF children, tended to less deteriorate with time in PCD children who could benefit from an early diagnosis.

Here, with a comprehensive literature review, we report a couple with an infertility history of 9 years and three unsuccessful IVF treatments, where male partner has Kartagener's Syndrome, a subtype of PCD, displaying recurrent respiratory infections, dextrocardia and total asthenozoospermia. His diagnosis was verified with transmission electron microscopy and genetic mutation screening, revealing total absence of dynein arms in sperm tails and homozygous mutation in the ZMYND10, heterozygous mutations in the ARMC4 and DNAH5 genes. Laser assisted viability assay (LAVA) was performed by shooting the sperm tails during sperm retrieval for microinjection, following detection of pentoxifylline resistant immotile sperm. Live births of healthy triplets, one boy and two monozygotic girls, was achieved after double blastocyst transfer.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinical rare peculiar disorder, mainly featured by respiratory infection, tympanitis, nasosinusitis, and male infertility. Previous study demonstrated it is an autosomal recessive disease and by 2017 almost 40 pathologic genes have been identified. Among them are the leucine-rich repeat- (LRR-) containing 6 (LRRC6) codes for a 463-amino-acid cytoplasmic protein, expressed distinctively in motile cilia cells, including the testis cells and the respiratory epithelial cells. In this study, we applied whole-exome sequencing combined with PCD-known genes filtering to explore the genetic lesion of a PCD patient. A novel compound heterozygous mutation in LRRC6 (c.183T>G/p.N61K; c.179-1G>A) was identified and coseparated in this family. The missense mutation (c.183T>G/p.N61K) may lead to a substitution of asparagine by lysine at position 61 in exon 3 of LRRC6. The splice site mutation (c.179-1G>A) may cause a premature stop codon in exon 4 and decrease the mRNA levels of LRRC6. Both mutations were not present in our 200 local controls, dbSNP, and 1000 genomes. Three bioinformatics programs also predicted that both mutations are deleterious. Our study not only further supported the importance of LRRC6 in PCD, but also expanded the spectrum of LRRC6 mutations and will contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of PCD patients.

Optos ultra-widefield imaging of the fundus showed glaucomatous cupping, drusen, and retinal pigment epithelium changes within the macular region. Humphrey visual field testing confirmed glaucomatous changes. Drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments were observed bilaterally with optical coherence tomography. We hypothesize that in addition to the lungs, spermatozoa and the Fallopian tubes, the retinal pigment epithelium may also be affected by ciliary dysfunction in individuals with Kartagener syndrome. Given recent advances in our knowledge of retinal ciliopathies, further studies are needed to understand how ciliary dysfunction affects the retina in Kartagener syndrome.

"	"Intravital microscopy (IVM) offers the opportunity to visualize static and dynamic changes of tissue on a cellular level. It is a valuable tool in research and may considerably improve clinical diagnosis. In contrast to confocal and non-linear microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with microscopic resolution (mOCT) provides intrinsically cross-sectional imaging. Changing focus position is not needed, which simplifies especially endoscopic imaging. For in-vivo imaging, here we are presenting endo-microscopic OCT (emOCT). A graded-index-lens (GRIN) based 2.75 mm outer diameter rigid endoscope is providing 1.5 - 2 µm nearly isotropic resolution over an extended field of depth. Spherical and chromatic aberrations are used to elongate the focus length. Simulation of the OCT image formation, suggests a better overall image quality in this range compared to a focused Gaussian beam. Total imaging depth at a reduced sensitivity and lateral resolution is more than 200 µm. Using a frame rate of 80 Hz cross-sectional images of concha nasalis were demonstrated in humans, which could resolve cilial motion, cellular structures of the epithelium, vessels and blood cells. Mucus transport velocity was successfully determined. The endoscope may be used for diagnosis and treatment control of different lung diseases like cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, which manifest already at the nasal mucosa.

"	"Zinc finger MYND-type-containing 10 (ZMYND10), a cytoplasmic protein expressed in ciliated cells, causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) when mutated; however, its function is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we examined the roles of ZMYND10 using Zmynd10-/-mice exhibiting typical PCD phenotypes, including hydrocephalus and laterality defects. In these mutants, morphology, the number of motile cilia, and the 9+2 axoneme structure were normal; however, inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively) were absent. ZMYND10 interacted with ODA components and proteins, including LRRC6, DYX1C1, and C21ORF59, implicated in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of DAs, whose levels were significantly reduced in Zmynd10-/-mice. LRRC6 and DNAI1 were more stable when co-expressed with ZYMND10 than when expressed alone. DNAI2, which did not interact with ZMYND10, was not stabilized by co-expression with ZMYND10 alone, but was stabilized by co-expression with DNAI1 and ZMYND10, suggesting that ZMYND10 stabilized DNAI1, which subsequently stabilized DNAI2. Together, these results demonstrated that ZMYND10 regulated the early stage of DA cytoplasmic pre-assembly by stabilizing DNAI1.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by chronic airway disease, male infertility, and randomization of the left/right body axis as a result of defects of motile cilia and sperm flagella. We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open-reading frame C11orf70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11orf70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, as a result of the loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11orf70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11orf70 showed that C11orf70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11orf70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein-arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11orf70 is a preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of additional genetic defects that cause PCD and male infertility is of great importance for the clinic as well as for genetic counselling.

We report feasibility of measurement and natural evolution of nasal NO and upon the impact of respiratory tract infection (RTI) on nasal NO in healthy infants (HI), followed from birth until age 2 years, with comparison to nasal NO in infant PCD.Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurements were performed at scheduled visits at 2 weeks old and at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months old, with extra visits during RTIs. Historical nasal NO measurements for infant PCD were included for comparison.Altogether, 224 nasal NO measurements were performed in 44 enrolled infants. Median newborn nasal NO was 46 ppb (interquartile range (IQR) 29-69 ppb), increasing at a rate of 5.4% per month up to 283 ppb (IQR 203-389 ppb) at the age of 2 years. RTIs in 27 out of 44 infants temporarily suppressed nasal NO by 79%. Values for nasal NO in seven infants with PCD ranged from 6-80 ppb. The success rate to accept nasal NO sampling was 223 out of 224 measurements (99.6%).Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurement was indeed feasible in infancy and nasal NO in HI increased significantly up to 2 years of age, in opposition to nasal NO in PCD cases, which stayed low past 2 years of age. RTI episodes caused marked, temporary reductions in nasal NO in HI indistinguishable from that in infant PCD, suggesting that nasal NO should be measured in RTI-free intervals.

"	"Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is associated with morbidity and mortality in health and disease, and provides important information of global physical health not achieved from standard pulmonary function tests. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are genetically determined diseases involving different basic defects, but both showing impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic infections and pulmonary destruction early in life. PCD is generally considered a milder disease than CF and it is hypothesized that children with CF would have consistently lower VO2peak and pulmonary function than children with PCD. We performed a prospective, observational single-center, clinical cohort study of VO2peak and pulmonary function in age and gender matched schoolchildren, at two occasions 12 months apart. VO2peak was persistently (at baseline and after 12 months) and significantly reduced in the 22 patients with PCD (z-score = -0.89 and -1.0) and 24 with CF (z-score = -0.94 and -1.1), included in the study. Abnormal VO2peak was detected in a larger proportion of children with PCD (≈30%) than CF (≈13%). Moreover, children with PCD exhibited persistently lower FEV1 (p < 0.0001 at first visit and p = 0.001 at second visit) while FEF25-75 and FVC differed only at baseline. Indeed, a retrospective analysis comparing lung function over the last year in our entire PCD and CF populations between 6 and 18 years of age, revealed lower values in patients with PCD (FEV1 z-score, p = 0.0004, FVC z-score p < 0.0001, FEF25-75 z-score p = 0.008). This is the first report indicating that cardiopulmonary fitness is equally and consistently reduced in both children with PCD and CF along with a consistent lower pulmonary function in PCD compared with CF. A certain reservation for possible selection bias and the small number of patients is necessary. However, increased focus on early diagnosis, evidence-based treatment regimens and close clinical monitoring in PCD are warranted.

"	"Molecular chaperones promote the folding and macromolecular assembly of a diverse set of 'client' proteins. How ubiquitous chaperone machineries direct their activities towards specific sets of substrates is unclear. Through the use of mouse genetics, imaging and quantitative proteomics we uncover that ZMYND10 is a novel co-chaperone that confers specificity for the FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex towards axonemal dynein clients required for cilia motility. Loss of ZMYND10 perturbs the chaperoning of axonemal dynein heavy chains, triggering broader degradation of dynein motor subunits. We show that pharmacological inhibition of FKBP8 phenocopies dynein motor instability associated with the loss of ZMYND10 in airway cells and that human disease-causing variants of ZMYND10 disrupt its ability to act as an FKBP8-HSP90 co-chaperone. Our study indicates that primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), caused by mutations in dynein assembly factors disrupting cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors, should be considered a cell-type specific protein-misfolding disease.

Improvement in diagnostic testing is an area of current research. During diagnostic evaluation of PCD we observed ciliated conical protrusions from part of the apical surface of ciliated cells in those diagnosed with PCD. The aim of this study was to investigate if this abnormality was specific to PCD. Epithelial edges from 67 consecutively diagnosed PCD patients, 67 patients consecutively referred for PCD diagnostic testing in whom PCD was excluded, 22 with asthma and 18 with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were studied retrospectively in a blinded manner using light microscopy. Forty six out of 67 patients with PCD had ciliated conical epithelial protrusions, whereas none were seen in patients where PCD was excluded, or in patients with asthma or CF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the presence of the ciliated conical protrusions to predict a diagnosis of PCD were 76.5, 100, 100 and 77% respectively. Characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from ciliated epithelial cells maybe a useful pointer to the diagnosis of PCD. However, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of PCD.

"	"Defective airway host-defense (e.g., altered mucus properties, ciliary defects) contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. This study aims to determine whether genetic mutations associated with defective airway host-defense are implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Based on the systematic screening of 32 frequently reported bronchiectasis-associated genes, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on peripheral blood samples from 192 bronchiectasis patients and 100 healthy subjects. The variant distribution frequency and pathogenicity of mutations were analyzed. We identified 162 rare variants in 192 bronchiectasis patients, and 85 rare variants among 100 healthy subjects. Among bronchiectasis patients, 25 (15.4%), 117 (72.2%) and 18 (11.1%) rare variants were associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR), epithelial sodium channel, and primary ciliary dyskinesia genes, respectively. Biallelic CFTR variants were detected in four bronchiectasis patients but none of the healthy subjects. Carriers of homozygous p.M470 plus at least one CFTR rare variant were detected in 6.3% of bronchiectasis patients (n=12) and in 1.0% of healthy subjects (n=1, P=0.039). Twenty-six patients (16 with idiopathic and 6 with post-infectious bronchiectasis) harbored biallelic variants. Bronchiectasis patients with biallelic DNAH5 variants, or biallelic CFTR variants plus an epithelial sodium channel variant, tended to have greater disease severity. Genetic mutations leading to impaired host-defense might have implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Genetic screening may be a useful tool for unraveling the underlying causes of bronchiectasis, and offers molecular information which is complementary to conventional etiologic assessment for bronchiectasis.

Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey® to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.

The analysis methods strongly influenced LCI (mean±sd overall differences (%) between standard and alternative analysis methods: -4.9±5.7%; range: -66-19%), but did not improve intra-test variability. Discrimination between health and disease was comparable as areas under the receiver operator curves were not greater than that from standard analysis. This study supports current recommendations for LCI calculation in children. Alternative methods influence LCI estimates and hamper comparability between MBW setups.

30032860	"Comparative proteomics of respiratory exosomes in cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and asthma
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are pulmonary genetic disorders associated with inflammation and heterogeneous progression of the lung disease. We hypothesized that respiratory exosomes, nanovesicles circulating in the respiratory tract, may be involved in the progression of inflammation-related lung damage. We compared proteomic content of respiratory exosomes isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in CF and PCD to asthma (A), a condition also associated with inflammation but with less severe lung damage. BALF were obtained from 3 CF, 3 PCD and 6 A patients. Exosomes were isolated from BALF by ultracentrifugations and characterized using immunoelectron microscopy and western-blot. Exosomal protein analysis was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry using label-free quantification. Exosome enrichment was validated by electron microscopy and immunodetection of CD9, CD63 and ALIX. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the quantification of 665 proteins, of which 14 were statistically differential according to the disease. PCD and CF exosomes contained higher levels of antioxidant proteins (Superoxide-dismutase, Glutathione peroxidase-3, Peroxiredoxin-5) and proteins involved in leukocyte chemotaxis. All these proteins are known activators of the NF-KappaB pathway. Our results suggest that respiratory exosomes are involved in the pro-inflammatory propagation during the extension of CF or PCD lung diseases. The mechanism of local propagation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is not clearly understood. Differential Proteomic profiles of exosomes isolated from BAL from CF, PCD and asthmatic patients suggest that they carry pro-inflammatory proteins that may be involved in the progression of lung damage.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) has been considered a relatively mild disease, especially compared to cystic fibrosis (CF), but studies on lung function in PCD patients have been few and small.This study compared lung function from spirometry of PCD patients to normal reference values and to published data from CF patients. We calculated z-scores and % predicted values for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) using the Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 values for 991 patients from the international PCD Cohort. We then assessed associations with age, sex, country, diagnostic certainty, organ laterality, body mass index and age at diagnosis in linear regression models. Lung function in PCD patients was reduced compared to reference values in both sexes and all age groups. Children aged 6-9 years had the smallest impairment (FEV1 z-score -0.84 (-1.03 to -0.65), FVC z-score -0.31 (-0.51 to -0.11)). Compared to CF patients, FEV1 was similarly reduced in children (age 6-9 years PCD 91% (88-93%); CF 90% (88-91%)), but less impaired in young adults (age 18-21 years PCD 79% (76-82%); CF 66% (65-68%)). The results suggest that PCD affects lung function from early in life, which emphasises the importance of early standardised care for all patients.

30151187	"Bronchiectasis in PCD looks different to CF on CT scan
"	"The contemporary diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires CT scanning to describe specific structural lung changes. Scoring systems have been designed and validated in some specific causes of bronchiectasis to allow investigators to correlate CT changes with other indices of disease severity, to describe changes over time, with exacerbation and in response to treatment. Several scoring systems have been developed for CF including the Bhalla Score, Brody score, and the Helbich score. These scoring systems have also been applied to other causes of bronchiectasis including Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). This assumes that the nature of structural lung disease in these conditions, as well as the rate and nature of longitudinal changes are identical to, or at least very similar to, those found in CF. This assumption has not been tested. The underlying pathophysiology of PCD is not the same as CF and may cause bronchiectasis that is radiologically similar but not necessarily the same as CF or any other cause of bronchiectasis. The development of a disease specific scoring system for structural change in cases of non-CF bronchiectasis due to any cause, would require consideration of the full range of changes seen in that condition without reference to changes seen in other conditions. We present a summary of structural findings that have been described in PCD and highlight the radiological differences between PCD and other causes of bronchiectasis. We suggest that a PCD specific CT scoring system is required to properly describe changes seen in PCD.

"	"Congenital hydrocephalus results from cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the ventricles of the brain and causes severe neurological damage, but the underlying causes are not well understood. It is associated with several syndromes, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is caused by dysfunction of motile cilia. We previously demonstrated that mouse models of PCD lacking ciliary proteins CFAP221, CFAP54 and SPEF2 all have hydrocephalus with a strain-dependent severity. While morphological defects are more severe on the C57BL/6J (B6) background than 129S6/SvEvTac (129), cerebrospinal fluid flow is perturbed on both backgrounds, suggesting that abnormal cilia-driven flow is not the only factor underlying the hydrocephalus phenotype. Here, we performed a microarray analysis on brains from wild type and nm1054 mice lacking CFAP221 on the B6 and 129 backgrounds. Expression differences were observed for a number of genes that cluster into distinct groups based on expression pattern and biological function, many of them implicated in cellular and biochemical processes essential for proper brain development. These include genes known to be functionally relevant to congenital hydrocephalus, as well as formation and function of both motile and sensory cilia. Identification of these genes provides important clues to mechanisms underlying congenital hydrocephalus severity.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and heterogeneous genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of motile cilia. In the airway epithelium, impaired ciliary motion results in reduced or absent mucociliary clearance that leads to the appearance of chronic airway infection, sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PCD, and research is limited by the lack of convenient models to study this disease and investigate innovative therapies. Furthermore, the high heterogeneity of PCD genotypes is likely to hinder the development of a single therapy for all patients. The generation of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their differentiation into airway epithelium as well as genome editing technologies could represent major tools for in vitro PCD modelling and for developing personalized therapies. Here, we review PCD pathogenesis, and then discuss how human iPSC could be used to model this disease for the development of innovative patient-specific biotherapies.

30238669	"The prevalence of the defining features of primary ciliary dyskinesia within a cri du chat syndrome cohort
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) are distinct disorders that can co-occur due to a common genetic locus on chromosome 5p. Chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD can occur in CdCS and are typically attributed to hypotonia, dysphagia, and aspiration. The prevalence of PCD among individuals with CdCS is not known. An online survey assessing common features of PCD was distributed to members of the 5P Minus Society, a cri du chat patient advocacy group. Respondents who met criteria for elevated risk of PCD (at least 3 symptoms or other features highly suggestive of PCD) were offered PCD genetic testing. For the 123 respondents (median age 10.1 years with IQR 5.5-17.3 years; from 33 U.S. states and 10 other countries) chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD were prevalent, including unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion beginning in infancy, and year-round, wet cough beginning in infancy in 35%, 32%, and 20% of respondents, respectively. Fifteen respondents (12%) met criteria for elevated risk for PCD and completed genetic analysis; however, none were diagnostic for PCD. A PCD clinical center evaluated an additional subject with CdCS who met criteria for likely PCD and had negative genetics, but had diagnostic electron microscopy of the respiratory cilia (missing outer dynein arms). Clinicians should be aware of the genetic connection between CdCS and PCD. Non-informative genetic testing does not rule out PCD. CdCS patients with chronic respiratory symptoms may benefit from referral to specialized PCD diagnostic centers.

"	"Motility is the most important property of mammalian sperm required for fertilization. Axoneme and axoneme surrounding tail components are the morphological substrate of sperm motility. Quantitative research methods of human spermatozoa motility allowed the definition of the normative parameters for fertile men. Exogenous factors, and, rarely, genetic defects may cause a significant reduction in sperm motility. Axonemal anomalies (absence of external and/or internal dynein arms, central pair of microtubules absence) may be the cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD—a severe systemic disease of the reduction of sperm motility—is just one symptom. Dysplasia of the fibrous sheath (DFO) is also genetically determined sperm motility decrease. PCD and the DFO are multigene diseases that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Modern molecular biological research methods are used to identify candidate genes. Assisted reproduction technologies (ART) allow men suffering from PCD and DFO to produce offspring. PCD and DFO symptoms appear in the homozygote. Children born after ART have the probability of being mutation carriers. We do not have complete information about etiological factor of genetically determined spermpathology. So we cannot assess the genetic risk degree. However, the possibility of mutations accumulation, which can be a risk factor for distant offspring, should be considered.

The Clinical Registry Investigating BBS, a worldwide registry exploring the phenotype and natural history of BBS, was used to conduct the study. Protected health information was obtained by subject or family interview and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved release of data including imaging studies and genetic testing. Echocardiography and imaging findings were independently confirmed by 2 cardiologists. Thoraco-abdominal abnormalities were identified in 6 of 368 (1.6%) subjects with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 60 Clinical Registry Investigating BBS participants. Diverse laterality defects were observed suggesting that the underlying ciliopathy randomly alters embryonic left-right axis orientation. Congenital heart disease, common in heterotaxy, was present in 2 subjects. Additional defects, uncommonly reported in BBS, were observed in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems in the subjects. No BBS genotype was favored in the cohort. One subject had genetic and clinical phenotype diagnostic of both primary ciliary dyskinesia and BBS. The variety of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in BBS suggests the pleiotropic nature of these anomalies is not confined to a single pattern or genotype. Clinicians providing care to individuals with BBS should consider the increased prevalence of thoraco-abdominal anomalies in BBS. Individuals with features suggestive of other ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, should undergo further evaluation for additional genetic disorders. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329210.

"	"In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the release of nitric oxide (NO) is extremely low by epithelia of the nasopharynx and sinuses. Measurement of nasal NO (nNO) is recommended as a screening test for PCD. The study aimed to evaluate if adenoids affects nNO and may deteriorate the performance of the test. In 48 nonallergic patients between 5 and 18 years of age with chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction and indications for adenoidectomy, the measurements of nNO by chemiluminescence analyser and nasal patency by active anterior rhinomanometry were performed both before and after adenoidectomy. Adenoidal tissue size was graded during surgery under general anaesthesia using transoral endoscopy. Patients were stratified into groups with adenoids grades 1, 2 and 3 (<1/3, 1/3-2/3 and > 2/3 of the choana and post-nasal space covered by adenoids). Before adenoidectomy, the median of nNO decreased with the increasing grade of adenoids (920, 663, and 491 ppb, P < 0.05). The rhinomanometry results were comparable and showed no correlation with nNO. Seven patients (14.6%) were incorrectly classified to have PCD based on a subthreshold value of the volume flow of nNO (FnNO < 77 nL/min). Following adenoidectomy, nNO of the grade 3 patients increased by 107 ppb (P < 0.05) and no differences were found between groups (P = 0.40). All patients had the postadenoidectomy FnNO >77 nL/min. nNO and FnNO are reduced in nonallergic children with obstructive adenoids.

"	"To determine whether adenoid epithelium is superior to nasal mucosa for biopsy of ciliated epithelium for electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate pediatric patients with rhinosinusitis for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A retrospective review compared electron microscopic results in children with chronic or recurrent rhinosinusitis who underwent both adenoidectomy or nasopharyngeal biopsy and nasal mucosa biopsy in the course of evaluation for PCD at a tertiary care institution. Forty pediatric patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Nine of these patients had a prior adenoidectomy and therefore underwent nasopharyngeal biopsy for collection of adenoid tissue. All nine of the nasopharyngeal biopsies and 25 of the 31 (80.6%) adenoid biopsies had sufficient cilia for EM evaluation of the ultrastructure. Of the 40 patients who also had a nasal biopsy, only 12 (30.0%) had sufficient cilia for EM analysis. The distribution of sufficient versus insufficient cilia for analysis between adenoid and nasal mucosa was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Abnormal cilia were found in only 2.5% of our patients. In current practice, the nasal cavity is a common location for obtaining ciliated epithelium for EM analysis, as it is easily accessible for biopsy and the procedure itself causes relatively low patient morbidity. Chronic rhinosinusitis, however, has been associated with decreased cilia density on nasal respiratory epithelium. Given that adenoidectomies are often performed in children with chronic rhinosinusitis, our data suggest that adenoid tissue is a better source of ciliated tissue for analysis compared to turbinate epithelium.

30431343	"Emerging Concepts and Therapies for Mucoobstructive Lung Disease
"	"A spectrum of intrapulmonary airway diseases, for example, cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, can be categorized as ""mucoobstructive"" airway diseases. A common theme for these diseases appears to be the failure to properly regulate mucus concentration, producing mucus hyperconcentration that slows mucus transport and, importantly, generates plaque/plug adhesion to airway surfaces. These mucus plaques/plugs generate long diffusion distances for oxygen, producing hypoxic niches within adherent airway mucus and subjacent epithelia. Data suggest that concentrated mucus plaques/plugs are proinflammatory, in part mediated by release of IL-1α from hypoxic cells. The infectious component of mucoobstructive diseases may be initiated by anaerobic bacteria that proliferate within the nutrient-rich hypoxic mucus environment. Anaerobes ultimately may condition mucus to provide the environment for a succession to classic airway pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and ultimately Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Novel therapies to treat mucoobstructive diseases focus on restoring mucus concentration. Strategies to rehydrate mucus range from the inhalation of osmotically active solutes, designed to draw water into airway surfaces, to strategies designed to manipulate the relative rates of sodium absorption versus chloride secretion to endogenously restore epithelial hydration. Similarly, strategies designed to reduce the mucin burden in the airways, either by reducing mucin production/secretion or by clearing accumulated mucus (e.g., reducing agents), are under development. Thus, the new insights into a unifying process, that is, mucus hyperconcentration, that drives a significant component of the pathogenesis of mucoobstructive diseases promise multiple new therapeutic strategies to aid patients with this syndrome.

Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs∗13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2).

Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8 Hz versus control = 15.8 Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2-/- mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X. laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in PCD.

It results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly in the upper and lower airways. Central data collection in national and international registries is essential to studying the epidemiology of rare diseases and filling in gaps in knowledge of diseases such as PCD. For this reason, the Swiss Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Registry (CH-PCD) was founded in 2013 as a collaborative project between epidemiologists and adult and paediatric pulmonologists. We describe the objectives and methodology of the CH-PCD, present initial results, and give an overview of current and ongoing projects.  The registry records patients of any age, suffering from PCD, who are treated and resident in Switzerland. It collects information from patients identified through physicians, diagnostic facilities and patient organisations. The registry dataset contains data on diagnostic evaluations, lung function, microbiology and imaging, symptoms, treatments and hospitalisations.  By May 2018, CH-PCD has contacted 566 physicians of different specialties and identified 134 patients with PCD. At present, this number represents an overall 1 in 63,000 prevalence of people diagnosed with PCD in Switzerland. Prevalence differs by age and region; it is highest in children and adults younger than 30 years, and in Espace Mittelland. The median age of patients in the registry is 25 years (range 5–73), and 41 patients have a definite PCD diagnosis based on recent international guidelines. Data from CH-PCD are contributed to international collaborative studies and the registry facilitates patient identification for nested studies.

30774648	"Survey of the Ciliary Motility Machinery of Drosophila  Sperm and Ciliated Mechanosensory Neurons Reveals Unexpected Cell-Type Specific Variations: A Model for Motile Ciliopathies
"	"The motile cilium/flagellum is an ancient eukaryotic organelle. The molecular machinery of ciliary motility comprises a variety of cilium-specific dynein motor complexes along with other complexes that regulate their activity. Assembling the motors requires the function of dedicated ""assembly factors"" and transport processes. In humans, mutation of any one of at least 40 different genes encoding components of the motility apparatus causes Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of defective ciliary motility. Recently, Drosophila has emerged as a model for motile cilia biology and motile ciliopathies. This is somewhat surprising as most Drosophila cells lack cilia, and motile cilia are confined to just two specialized cell types: the sperm flagellum with a 9+2 axoneme and the ciliated dendrite of auditory/proprioceptive (chordotonal, Ch) neurons with a 9+0 axoneme. To determine the utility of Drosophila as a model for motile cilia, we survey the Drosophila genome for ciliary motility gene homologs, and assess their expression and function. We find that the molecules of cilium motility are well conserved in Drosophila. Most are readily characterized by their restricted cell-type specific expression patterns and phenotypes. There are also striking differences between the two motile ciliated cell types. Notably, sperm and Ch neuron cilia express and require entirely different outer dynein arm variants-the first time this has been clearly established in any organism. These differences might reflect the specialized functions for motility in the two cilium types. Moreover, the Ch neuron cilia lack the critical two-headed inner arm dynein (I1/f) but surprisingly retain key regulatory proteins previously associated with it. This may have implications for other motile 9+0 cilia, including vertebrate embryonic nodal cilia required for left-right axis asymmetry. We discuss the possibility that cell-type specificity in ciliary motility machinery might occur in humans, and therefore underlie some of the phenotypic variation observed in PCD caused by different gene mutations. Our work lays the foundation for the increasing use of Drosophila as an excellent model for new motile ciliary gene discovery and validation, for understanding motile cilium function and assembly, as well as understanding the nature of genetic defects underlying human motile ciliopathies.

However, limited systems based studies have been performed to elucidate proteins or network/s crucial to the motile ciliary interactome, although this approach holds promise for identification of multiple cilia-associated genes, which, in turn, could be utilized for screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Here, based on the assumption that FOXJ1-mediated regulatory and signaling networks are representative of the motile cilia interactome, we have constructed and analyzed the gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) mediated by FOXJ1. The predicted FOXJ1 regulatory network comprises of 424 directly and 148 indirectly regulated genes. Additionally, based on gene ontology analysis, we have associated 17 directly and 6 indirectly regulated genes with possible ciliary roles. Topological and perturbation analyses of the PPIN (6927 proteins, 40,608 interactions) identified 121 proteins expressed in ciliated cells, which interact with multiple proteins encoded by FoxJ1 induced genes (FIG) as important interacting proteins (IIP). However, it is plausible that IIP transcriptionally regulated by FOXJ1 and/or differentially expressed in PCD are likely to have crucial roles in motile cilia. We have found 20 de-regulated topologically important effector proteins in the FOXJ1 regulatory network, among which some (PLSCR1, SSX2IP, ACTN2, CDC42, HSP90AA1, PIAS4) have previously reported ciliary roles. Furthermore, based on pathway enrichment of these proteins and their primary interactors, we have rationalized their possible roles in the ciliary interactome. For instance, 5 among these novel proteins that are involved in cilia associated signaling pathways (like Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Toll-like receptor etc.) could be 'topologically important signaling proteins.' Therefore, based on this FOXJ1 network study we have predicted important effectors in the motile cilia interactome, which are possibly associated with ciliary biology and/or function and are likely to further our understanding of the pathophysiology in ciliopathies like PCD.

"	"There is a medial bulging of the lateral nasal wall in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Uncinate process (UP) angulation measurements in patients and controls to objectify this bulging. Thirty CF, 17 primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), 13 chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwp), and 30 controls were included. Angles were measured bilaterally on computed tomography (CT) scans: A, B, C on coronal sections, D and E on axial sections. Angle A was between the UP and the orbit inner wall, whereas the others were between UP and midline. There was no significant difference between controls, PCD, and CRSwp. However, CF had 3 statistically different angles with controls, 5 with CRSwp, and 4 with PCD. Angle A average value was 126° (±16°) in patients with CF, 138° (±19°) in controls ( P = .007), 145° (±15°) in PCD ( P = .001), and 138° (±14°) in CRSwp ( P = .001). Angle E average value was 35° (±10°) in patients with CF, 20° (±6°) in controls ( P < .001), 21° (±4°) in PCD ( P < .001), and 22° (±6°) in CRSwp ( P < .001). Uncinate process's anatomy is only modified in CF: Angle between UP and inner wall of orbit is closed, and angles between UP and midline are opened. These measures quantify the medial bulging of lateral nasal wall and support nasofibroscopic observations.

31012247	"The impact of mannose-binding lectin polymorphisms on lung function in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a congenital lung disease that leads to recurrent and chronic lung infection. The resulting inflammation causes lung damage and declines in lung function. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a first line host defense protein of importance for the innate immunity. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene named MBL2 result in unstable and low functional levels MBL proteins. MBL insufficiency is linked to an increased risk of lung infection and to declines in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. We investigated whether there is a similar link in patients with PCD. This retrospective longitudinal study included 85 patients with PCD. Diagnostics and age at diagnosis were recorded, complete spirometry data starting at diagnosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status over the last 2 years were collected, and the patients were grouped according to MBL2 genotype status (MBL2-sufficient or MBL2-deficient). MBL-deficient patients were diagnosed almost 3 years earlier than MBL-sufficient patients (median 6.1 vs 8.9 years, P  < 0.05). There were no differences in the first measured spirometry values, but MBL-deficient patients showed greater declines in forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1 ) than patients with MBL sufficiency (z-score: -0.049 per year [95% CI, -0.075; -0.021] vs -0.009 per year [95% CI, -0.033; 0.015]; P = 0.023). No differences were found in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, or infection status. MBL-deficiency, which is associated with MBL2 mutations, was associated with a lower age at diagnosis and with steeper declines in FEV1 in patients with PCD. This suggests that the MBL genotype might be a disease modifier in PCD.

31019772	"Additional role of bronchial mucosal biopsy for ciliary structural abnormality in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of diagnostic tests for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The mucosal samples obtained for cilia examination are generally procured from the nasal turbinate, but these specimens often yield inadequate results. The bronchial mucosa is recognized as an alternative sample, but no study has examined the additional utility of bronchial mucosa compared with nasal mucosa in the diagnosis of PCD. The medical records of 96 patients who underwent TEM for suspected PCD between April 1997 and June 2017 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on the site of mucosal biopsy: nasal biopsy (NB) group with nasal mucosal biopsy only; bronchial biopsy (BB) group with bronchial mucosal biopsy only; and nasal and bronchial biopsy (NBB) group with a combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsies. The rate of PCD diagnosis was 28.8% (17/59) in the NB group, 41.2% (7/17) in the BB group, and 60.0% (12/20) in the NBB group. The yield of PCD diagnosis significantly increased in the NBB group compared with the NB group (P=0.012). In the NBB group, 25.0% (5/20) of patients were diagnosed with PCD by nasal mucosal biopsy, and 35.0% (7/20) of patients were additionally diagnosed by bronchial mucosal biopsy. The presence of sinusitis or bronchiectasis was not associated with prediction of PCD diagnosis from nasal or bronchial mucosal biopsy. The combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsy for TEM showed higher yields of PCD diagnosis than nasal mucosal biopsy alone.

31092556	"Proteome of the central apparatus of a ciliary axoneme
"	"Nearly all motile cilia have a ""9+2"" axoneme containing a central apparatus (CA), consisting of two central microtubules with projections, that is essential for motility. To date, only 22 proteins are known to be CA components. To identify new candidate CA proteins, we used mass spectrometry to compare axonemes of wild-type Chlamydomonas and a CA-less mutant. We identified 44 novel candidate CA proteins, of which 13 are conserved in humans. Five of the latter were studied more closely, and all five localized to the CA; therefore, most of the other candidates are likely to also be CA components. Our results reveal that the CA is far more compositionally complex than previously recognized and provide a greatly expanded knowledge base for studies to understand the architecture of the CA and how it functions. The discovery of the new conserved CA proteins will facilitate genetic screening to identify patients with a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia that has been difficult to diagnose.

"	"By definition bronchiectasis (BE) means destructed structure of normal bronchus as a consequence of frequent bacterial infections and inflammation. In many senses, BE is a neglected orphan disease. A recent pan-European registry study, EMBARC, has been set up in order to better understand its pathophysiology, better phenotype patients, and to individualize their management. To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland. Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study. Baseline demographics, lung functions, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data, together with co-morbidities were entered into EMBARC database. Clinical characteristics, aetiologic factors, co-morbidities, and risk factors for extensive BE were explored. To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD ± 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1). Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE.

31160482	"Association of DNAH11  gene polymorphisms with asthenozoospermia in Northeast Chinese patients
"	"Reduced or no progressive sperm motility in the fresh ejaculate defines asthenozoospermia as one of the major causes of male infertility. The axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene encodes for one of the axonemal dynein heavy chain (DHC) family members and participates in assembling respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. Given the high degree of conservation of DNAH11, mutations could give rise to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and asthenozoospermia. To date, few studies have reported on the association between variants in DNAH11 and asthenozoospermia. In the present study, 87 patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia for variants in DNAH11 were screened by using high-throughput targeted gene sequencing technology. Bioinformatics analysis was further assessed. We found compound heterozygous variants (c.9484-1 G>T, c.12428 T>C) of DNAH11 detected in 1 of 87 patients. The variant c.9484-1 G>T was confirmed as a novel virulence variant which was predicted to affect splicing by Human Splicing Finder 3.1. And c.12428 T>C was predicted to be mildly pathogenic in silico analysis. We found that DNAH11 polymorphisms display strong associations with asthenozoospermia, and may contribute to an increased risk of male infertility in Chinese patients.

The inclusion criteria were laterality disorders (LD), cough with recurrent infections and the exclusion of other causes of bronchiectasis. Patients underwent at least two of the following tests: nasal nitric oxide, ciliary movement and analysis of ciliary immunofluorescence, and genetic tests (31 PCD genes + CFTR gene). The clinical characterization included the PICADAR and bronchiectasis scores, pulmonary function, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cPA) colonization, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and mucus rheology (MR). Forty-nine of the 500 patients were diagnosed with definite (42/49), probable (5/49), and clinical (2/49) PCD. Twenty-four patients (24/47) presented bi-allelic pathogenic variants in a total of 31 screened PCD genes. A PICADAR score > 5 was found in 37/49 patients, consanguinity in 27/49, LD in 28/49, and eight PCD sibling groups. FACED diagnosed 23/49 patients with moderate or severe bronchiectasis; FEV1 ≤ 50% in 25/49 patients, eight patients had undergone lung transplantation, four had been lobectomized and cPA+ was determined in 20/49.

"	"Calaxin is a Ca2+-binding dynein-associated protein that regulates flagellar and ciliary movement. In ascidians, calaxin plays essential roles in chemotaxis of sperm. However, nothing has been known for the function of calaxin in vertebrates. Here we show that the mice with a null mutation in Efcab1, which encodes calaxin, display typical phenotypes of primary ciliary dyskinesia, including hydrocephalus, situs inversus, and abnormal motility of trachea cilia and sperm flagella. Strikingly, both males and females are viable and fertile, indicating that calaxin is not essential for fertilization in mice. The 9 + 2 axonemal structures of epithelial multicilia and sperm flagella are normal, but the formation of 9 + 0 nodal cilia is significantly disrupted. Knockout of calaxin in zebrafish also causes situs inversus due to the irregular ciliary beating of Kupffer's vesicle cilia, although the 9 + 2 axonemal structure appears to remain normal.

To increase the knowledge about the CCDC103, we attempted genotype-phenotype correlations in two patients carrying novel homozygous (missense and frameshift) CCDC103 variants. Whole-exome sequencing, quantitative PCR, Western blot, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunogold labelling were performed to characterize CCDC103 expression profiles in reproductive and somatic cells. Our data demonstrate that pathogenic variants in CCDC103 gene negatively affect gene and protein expression in both patients who presented absence of DA on their axonemes. Further, we firstly report that CCDC103 is expressed at different levels in reproductive tissues and somatic cells and described that CCDC103 protein forms oligomers with tissue-specific sizes, which suggests that CCDC103 possibly undergoes post-translational modifications. Moreover, we reported that CCDC103 was restricted to the midpiece of sperm and is present at the cytoplasm of the other cells. Overall, our data support the CCDC103 involvement in PCD and suggest that CCDC103 may have different assemblies and roles in cilia and sperm flagella biology that are still unexplored.

Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] ≥ 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information).

Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a motile ciliopathy, whose symptoms include airway infections, male infertility and situs inversus. Apart from the typical forms of PCD, rare syndromic PCD forms exist. Mutations of the X-linked OFD1 gene cause several syndromic ciliopathies, including oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome type 10 (JBTS10), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2, the latter causing the X-linked syndromic form of PCD. Neurological and skeletal symptoms are characteristic for these syndromes, with their severity depending on the location of the mutation within the gene. To elucidate the role of motile cilia defects in the respiratory phenotype of PCD patients with C-terminal OFD1 mutations. Whole-exome sequencing in a group of 120 Polish PCD patients, mutation screening of the OFD1 coding sequence, analysis of motile cilia, and magnetic resonance brain imaging. Four novel hemizygous OFD1 mutations, in exons 20 and 21, were found in men with a typical PCD presentation but without severe neurological, skeletal or renal symptoms characteristic for other OFD1-related syndromes. Magnetic resonance brain imaging in two patients did not show a molar tooth sign typical for JBTS10. Cilia in the respiratory epithelium were sparse, unusually long and displayed a defective motility pattern. Consistent with the literature, truncations of the C-terminal part of OFD1 (exons 16-22) almost invariably cause a respiratory phenotype (due to motile cilia defects) while their impact on the primary cilia function is limited. We suggest that exons 20-21 should be included in the panel for regular mutation screening in PCD.

Moreover, in Patient-2, functional data revealed a reduction of gene expression and protein mislocalization in both genes' products. Our work calls the researcher's attention to the complexity of the PCD and to the possibility of gene interactions modelling the PCD phenotype.

Remarkably, 23.5% of patients carried the same c.2190del CCDC39 mutation. Single nucleotide polymorphism profiling in six unrelated patients carrying this mutation has revealed a founder effect in North-African patients. This mutation is estimated to date back at least 1,400-1,750 years ago.

Children (n = 71), adolescents (n = 85), and parents (n = 68) from multiple centers in the UK and North America completed age-appropriate QOL-PCD and generic QOL measures: pediatric QOL inventory, COPD assessment test (CAT), and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20. Total of 13 children, 13 parents, and 17 adolescents repeated QOL-PCD 10 to 14 days later to assess test-retest reliability. Multitrait analysis evaluated how the items loaded to hypothesized scales: physical, emotional & social functioning, treatment burden, role, vitality, upper and lower respiratory symptoms, and ears and hearing symptoms. Examination of item-to-total correlations led to removal of three, five, and six items, respectively in the prototype child, adolescent and parent-proxy versions; the validated measures now comprise between 34 and 38 items. The QOL-PCD scales had good internal consistency; Cronbach's α for QOL-PCD parent-proxy ranged 0.62 to 0.86. Test-retest reliability demonstrated stability across all scales; for example QOL-PCD adolescent intraclass correlation coefficients ranged 0.71 to 0.89. Significant relationships were found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, QOL-PCD adolescent lower respiratory symptoms and the CAT score (r = .64, P < .01); weaker correlations were found between different constructs.

31479451	"NME5 frameshift variant in Alaskan Malamutes with primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary defect of motile cilia in humans and several domestic animal species. Typical clinical findings are chronic recurrent infections of the respiratory tract and fertility problems. We analyzed an Alaskan Malamute family, in which two out of six puppies were affected by PCD. The parents were unaffected suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Linkage and homozygosity mapping defined critical intervals comprising ~118 Mb. Whole genome sequencing of one case and comparison to 601 control genomes identified a disease associated frameshift variant, c.43delA, in the NME5 gene encoding a sparsely characterized protein associated with ciliary function. Nme5-/- knockout mice exhibit doming of the skull, hydrocephalus and sperm flagellar defects. The genotypes at NME5:c.43delA showed the expected co-segregation with the phenotype in the Alaskan Malamute family. An additional unrelated Alaskan Malamute with PCD and hydrocephalus that became available later in the study was also homozygous mutant at the NME5:c.43delA variant. The mutant allele was not present in more than 1000 control dogs from different breeds. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated absence of the NME5 protein from nasal epithelia of an affected dog. We therefore propose NME5:c.43delA as the most likely candidate causative variant for PCD in Alaskan Malamutes. These findings enable genetic testing to avoid the unintentional breeding of affected dogs in the future. Furthermore, the results of this study identify NME5 as a novel candidate gene for unsolved human PCD and/or hydrocephalus cases.

31545650	"SPEF2-  and HYDIN -Mutant Cilia Lack the Central Pair-associated Protein SPEF2, Aiding Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Diagnostics
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous chronic destructive airway disease. PCD is traditionally diagnosed by nasal nitric oxide measurement, analysis of ciliary beating, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and/or genetic testing. In most genetic PCD variants, laterality defects can occur. However, it is difficult to establish a diagnosis in individuals with PCD and central pair (CP) defects, and alternative strategies are required because of very subtle ciliary beating abnormalities, a normal ciliary ultrastructure, and normal situs composition. Mutations in HYDIN are known to cause CP defects, but the genetic analysis of HYDIN variants is confounded by the pseudogene HYDIN2, which is almost identical in terms of intron/exon structure. We have previously shown that several types of PCD can be diagnosed via immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy analyses. Here, using IF microscopy, we demonstrated that in individuals with PCD and CP defects, the CP-associated protein SPEF2 is absent in HYDIN-mutant cells, revealing its dependence on functional HYDIN. Next, we performed IF analyses of SPEF2 in respiratory cells from 189 individuals with suspected PCD and situs solitus. Forty-one of the 189 individuals had undetectable SPEF2 and were subjected to a genetic analysis, which revealed one novel loss-of-function mutation in SPEF2 and three reported and 13 novel HYDIN mutations in 15 individuals. The remaining 25 individuals are good candidates for new, as-yet uncharacterized PCD variants that affect the CP apparatus. SPEF2 mutations have been associated with male infertility but have not previously been identified to cause PCD. We identified a mutation of SPEF2 that is causative for PCD with a CP defect. We conclude that SPEF2 IF analyses can facilitate the detection of CP defects and evaluation of the pathogenicity of HYDIN variants, thus aiding the molecular diagnosis of CP defects.

"	"The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is difficult and requires a combination of clinical features, nasal nitric oxide testing, cilia ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy (EM), and genetics. A recently described cytoplasmic ultrastructural change termed ""ciliary inclusions"" was reported to be diagnostic of PCD; however, no supporting evidence of PCD was provided. In this study, we sought to confirm, or refute, the diagnosis of PCD in subjects with ""ciliary inclusions"" on EM. Six subjects from five families with previous lab reports of ""ciliary inclusions"" on EMs of ciliated cells were identified and evaluated at a Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium site. We performed a detailed clinical history, nasal nitric oxide measurement, genetic testing including whole-exome sequencing (WES), and when possible, repeat ciliary EM study. Only one of six subjects had multiple and persistent clinical features congruent with PCD. No subject had situs inversus. Only one of six subjects had a very low nasal nitric oxide level. No ""ciliary inclusions"" were found in three subjects who had a repeat ciliary EM, and ciliary axonemal ultrastructures were normal. Genetic testing, including WES, was negative for PCD-causing genes, and for pathogenic variants in gene pathways that might cause ""ciliary inclusions,"" such as ciliary biogenesis. ""Ciliary Inclusions"", in isolation, are not sufficient to diagnosis PCD. If seen, additional studies should be done to pursue an accurate diagnosis.

The authors present the case of 17 year-old girl with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, non-specific lung nodules and end-stage kidney disease. A genetic examination confirmed only diagnosis of nephronophthisis type I. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.

"	"To evaluate whether cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants are more common among individuals tested for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) compared with controls. Data were studied from 1021 individuals with commercial genetic testing for suspected PCD and 91 777 controls with genetic testing at the same company (Invitae) for symptoms/diseases unrelated to PCD or CFTR testing. The prevalence of CFTR variants was compared between controls and each of 3 groups of individuals tested for PCD (PCD-positive, -uncertain, and -negative molecular diagnosis). The prevalence of 1 pathogenic CFTR variant was similar among the individual groups. When combining the PCD-uncertain and PCR-negative molecular diagnosis groups, there was a higher prevalence of single pathogenic CFTR variants compared with controls (P = .03). Importantly, >1% of individuals who had negative genetic testing results for PCD had 2 pathogenic CFTR variants (8 of 723), and the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) (2 pathogenic variants) is roughly 1 in 3000 individuals of Caucasian ethnicity (∼0.03%). This incidence was also greater than that of 2 pathogenic CFTR variants in the control population (0.09% [84 of 91 777]; P = 9.60 × 10-16). These variants correlate with mild CFTR-related disease. Our results suggest that a single pathogenic CFTR variant is not likely to be a PCD-mimetic, but ongoing studies are needed in individuals in whom PCD is suspected and genetic testing results are uncertain or negative. Furthermore, CF may be misdiagnosed as PCD, reflecting phenotypic overlap. Among individuals evaluated for PCD, CF should be considered in the differential even in the CF newborn screening era.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder of motile cilia dysfunction generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Genetic testing is increasingly considered an early step in the PCD diagnostic workflow. We used targeted panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) for genetic screening of 33 Egyptian families with clinically highly suspected PCD. All variants prioritized were Sanger confirmed in the affected individuals and correctly segregated within the family. Targeted NGS yielded a high diagnostic output (70%) with biallelic mutations identified in known PCD genes. Mutations were identified in 13 genes overall, with CCDC40 and CCDC39 the most frequently mutated genes among Egyptian patients. Most identified mutations were predicted null effect variants (79%) and not reported before (85%). This study reveals that the genetic landscape of PCD among Egyptians is highly heterogeneous, indicating that a targeted NGS approach covering multiple genes will provide a superior diagnostic yield compared to Sanger sequencing for genetic diagnosis. The high diagnostic output achieved here highlights the potential of placing genetic testing early within the diagnostic workflow for PCD, in particular in developing countries where other diagnostic tests can be less available.

31696788	"Investigation on Ciliary Functionality of Different Airway Epithelial Cell Lines in Three-Dimensional Cell Culture
"	"Three-dimensional respiratory tissue models have been generated using, for example, human primary airway epithelial cells (hAEC) or respective cell lines. To investigate ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, the presence of functional kinocilia in vitro is an essential prerequisite. Since access to hAEC of healthy donors is limited, we aimed to identify a respiratory epithelial cell line that is capable to display functional kinocilia on at least 60% of the apical surface. Thus, we cultured four different human respiratory cell lines with human primary airway fibroblasts under airlift conditions, characterized the morphology, and analyzed ciliary function. Only one of the tested cell lines showed beating kinocilia; however, <10% of the whole surface was covered and ciliary beating was undirected. Positive control tissue models using hAEC and fibroblasts displayed expected directed ciliary beating pattern around 11 Hz. Our data show that the available cell lines are not suitable for basic and applied research questions whenever functional kinocilia are required and that, rather, hAEC- or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue models need to be generated. Impact Statement To study ciliopathies or Bordetella pertussis infection in vitro, three-dimensional respiratory tissue models with functional kinocilia covering at least 60% of the model's surface are mandatory. We cultured four respiratory cell lines on a fibroblast-loaded biological scaffold and showed that none of them met this requirement. In contrast, primary airway cell-derived models sufficiently reflected the mucociliary phenotype. To further search for an alternative to primary respiratory cells, investigations on other cell lines should be conducted or even new cell lines have to be generated.

"	"The human nasal epithelium contains basal stem/progenitor cells that produce differentiated multiciliated and mucosecretory progeny. Basal epithelial cells can be expanded in cell culture and instructed to differentiate at an air-liquid interface using transwell membranes and differentiation media. For basal cell expansion, we have used 3T3-J2 co-culture in epithelial culture medium containing EGF, insulin, and a RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632 (3T3 + Y). Here we describe our protocols for ciliated differentiation of these cultures at air-liquid interface and compare four commercially available differentiation media, across nine donor cell cultures (six healthy, two patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and one with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)). Bright-field and immunofluorescence imaging suggested broad similarity between differentiation protocols. Subtle differences were seen in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), ciliary beat frequency, mucus production, and the extent to which basal cells are retained in differentiated cultures. Overall, the specific differentiation medium used in our air-liquid interface culture protocol was not a major determinant of ciliation, and our data suggest that the differentiation potential of basal cells at the outset is a more critical factor in air-liquid interface culture outcome. Detailed information on the constituents of the differentiation media was only available from one of the four manufacturers, a factor that may have profound implications in the interpretation of some research studies.

"	"Bronchial epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening occurs in diseases with both eosinophilic (allergic bronchial asthma [BA]) and neutrophilic (cystic fibrosis [CF] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]) chronic airway inflammation; however, the lung function and airway remodeling relation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to test whether ventilation inhomogeneity is related to RBM thickening. Multiple breath washout test, endobronchial biopsy, and BAL were performed in 24 children with CF, 11 with PCD, 15 with BA, and in 19 control subjects. Lung clearance index at 2.5% (1/40th) of starting nitrogen concentration (LCI2.5), RBM thickness, and lavage fluid cytology were quantified; their mutual associations were studied by using Spearman rank correlations (r). In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity (mean ± SD) was mild (LCI2.5, 9.3 ± 1.4 vs 7.9 ± 0.9 in control subjects; P = .0391), and the RBM thickened (5.26 ± 0.98 μm vs 3.12 ± 0.62 μm in control subjects; P < .0001). No relation between RBM thickness and ventilation inhomogeneity or lavage cytology was found. In CF and PCD, RBM thickness was similar to that in asthma (4.54 ± 0.66 μm and 5.27 ± 1.11 μm, respectively), but ventilation inhomogeneity was significantly higher (LCI2.5, 12.5 ± 2.4 and 11.8 ± 2.5). Both in CF and PCD, RBM thickness correlated with LCI2.5 (r = 0.594, P = .015; r = 0.821, P = .023). In PCD only, RBM thickness was also related to the number of neutrophils in lavage fluid (r = 0.821; P = .023). Lung function impairment in relation to RBM thickness was milder in BA than in CF and PCD. In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity did not correlate with RBM thickness, whereas it did in CF and PCD. This outcome suggests a different structure-function relation in these diseases.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in abnormal ciliary motility/structure, extremely heterogeneous at genetic and ultrastructural levels. We aimed, in light of extensive genotyping, to identify specific and quantitative ciliary beating anomalies, according to the ultrastructural phenotype. We prospectively included 75 patients with PCD exhibiting the main five ultrastructural phenotypes (n=15/group), screened all corresponding PCD genes and measured quantitative beating parameters by high-speed video-microscopy (HSV). Sixty-eight (91%) patients carried biallelic mutations. Combined outer/inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA) defect induces total ciliary immotility, regardless of the gene involved. ODA defect induces a residual beating with dramatically low ciliary beat frequency (CBF) related to increased recovery stroke and pause durations, especially in case of DNAI1 mutations. IDA defect with microtubular disorganisation induces a low percentage of beating cilia with decreased beating angle and, in case of CCDC39 mutations, a relatively conserved mean CBF with a high maximal CBF. Central complex defect induces nearly normal beating parameters, regardless of the gene involved, and a gyrating motion in a minority of ciliated edges, especially in case of RSPH1 mutations. PCD with normal ultrastructure exhibits heterogeneous HSV values, but mostly an increased CBF with an extremely high maximal CBF. Quantitative HSV analysis in PCD objectives beating anomalies associated with specific ciliary ultrastructures and genotypes. It represents a promising approach to guide the molecular analyses towards the best candidate gene(s) to be analysed or to assess the pathogenicity of the numerous sequence variants identified by next-generation-sequencing.

"	"CCDC103 is a small protein with unusual biophysical properties that is required for outer dynein arm assembly on ciliary axonemes. Mutations in both human and zebrafish CCDC103 proteins lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia. Previous studies revealed that this protein can oligomerize and appears to be arrayed along the entire length of the ciliary axoneme. CCDC103 also binds purified microtubules directly and indeed stabilizes them. Here we use biochemical approaches to identify two regions of CCDC103 that mediate self-interaction. In both cases, these associations are stable to heating in the presence of detergent and are not disrupted by strong reducing agents. One interaction region consists of a 27-residue inherently disorder segment that can mediate heat/detergent-resistant dimerization when attached to unrelated monomeric proteins. The second interface includes the C-terminal RPAP3_C alpha helical domain. Our data suggest that CCDC103 can form an unconventional polymer and we propose models for how the monomers might be organized. We also use molecular modeling of the RPAP3_C domain to determine the structural consequences of the pathogenic H154P mutation found in human PCD patients.

Hence, this study was designed to identify specific gene markers that affected NPC progression through gene expression profile analysis. NPC-related gene expression data set gene set enrichment (GSE)53819 were retrieved and analyzed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by determination of their expression in noncancerous tissues and NPC specimens. Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted on DEGs to obtain tumor-associated gene modules. Genes in those modules were intersected with DEGs for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Then protein-protein interaction network of tumor-associated genes was constructed to select genes most closely linked to NPC. Afterward, expression of chromosome 9 open reading frame 24 (c9orf24), primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (PCDP1), and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 46 (LRRC46) was detected in GSE53819 and further verified in GSE12452 and GSE64634. Differential analysis on GSE53819 found that 2,173 genes were aberrantly expressed in NPC, among which 917 genes are upregulated and 1,256 genes are downregulated. WGCNA showed that genes were enriched in 17 modules and 727 genes exhibited ectopic expression in NPC and enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis signaling pathways, among which c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 were poorly expressed in NPC. Therefore, c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 might serve as prominent diagnostic markers for NPC, which presents new insights for NPC therapy.

Defects in ODAs and IDAs result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease characterized by recurrent airway infections and male infertility.

We identified four loss-of-function mutations in TTC12, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein, in four independent families in which affected individuals displayed a peculiar PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of ODAs and IDAs in sperm flagella, contrasting with the absence of only IDAs in respiratory cilia. Analyses of both primary cells from individuals carrying TTC12 mutations and human differentiated airway cells invalidated for TTC12 by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed an IDA defect restricted to a subset of single-headed IDAs that are different in flagella and cilia, whereas TTC12 depletion in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia recapitulated the sperm phenotype. Overall, our study, which identifies TTC12 as a gene involved in PCD, unveils distinct dynein assembly mechanisms in human motile cilia versus flagella.

We identified one novel hemizygous frameshift variant (NM_173494, c.319_329del: p.R107fs) of DNAAF6 gene (previously named PIH1D3) in family 1 and one novel hemizygous missense variant (c.290G>T: p.G97V) in family 2. No hemizygous deleterious variants in DNAAF6 were detected in the control cohort of 442 individuals. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa showed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagella. Both variants were proven to lead to DNAAF6 protein degradation in HEK293T cells. Both patients carrying DNAAF6 variants underwent one ICSI cycle and delivered one healthy child each. We identified novel DNAAF6 variants causing male infertility and PCD in Han Chinese patients. This finding extended the spectrum of variants in DNAAF6 and revealed new light on the impact of DNAAF6 variants in sperm flagella.

32188167	"Understanding Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: Experience From a Mediterranean Diagnostic Reference Centre
"	"Due to the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test, reference centres with experienced personnel and costly procedures are needed for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostics. Diagnostic flowcharts always start with clinical symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this work is to define differential clinical criteria so that only patients clinically compatible with PCD are referred to reference centres. 18 variables from 476 Mediterranean patients with clinically suspicious PCD were collected. After analysing cilia function and ultrastructure, 89 individuals were diagnosed with PCD and 387 had a negative diagnosis. Simple logistic regression analysis, considering PCD as a dependent variable and the others as independent variables, was done. In order to define the variables that best explain PCD, a step-wise logistic regression model was defined. Aiming to classify individuals as PCD or PCD-like patients, based on variables included in the study, a classification and regression tree (CART) was designed. Simple logistic regression analysis shows statistically significant association between age at the beginning of their symptomatology, periodicity, fertility, situs inversus, recurrent otitis, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, chronic productive cough, rhinorrea, rhinusinusitis and recurrent pneumonias, and PCD. The step-wise logistic regression model selected situs inversus, atelectasis, rhinorrea, chronic productive cough, bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonias, and otitis as PCD predictive variables (82% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 0.92 Area Under the Curve (AUC)). A decision tree was designed in order to classify new individuals based on pansinusitis, situs inversus, periodicity, rhinorrea, bronchiectasis, and chronic wet cough.

32188719	"A quantitative super-resolution imaging toolbox for diagnosis of motile ciliopathies.
"	"Airway clearance of pathogens and particulates relies on motile cilia. Impaired cilia motility can lead to reduction in lung function, lung transplant, or death in some cases. More than 50 proteins regulating cilia motility are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a heterogeneous, mainly recessive genetic lung disease. Accurate PCD molecular diagnosis is essential for identifying therapeutic targets and for initiating therapies that can stabilize lung function, thereby reducing socioeconomic impact of the disease. To date, PCD diagnosis has mainly relied on nonquantitative methods that have limited sensitivity or require a priori knowledge of the genes involved. Here, we developed a quantitative super-resolution microscopy workflow: (i) to increase sensitivity and throughput, (ii) to detect structural defects in PCD patients' cells, and (iii) to quantify motility defects caused by yet to be found PCD genes. Toward these goals, we built a localization map of PCD proteins by three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy and implemented quantitative image analysis and machine learning to detect protein mislocalization, we analyzed axonemal structure by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, and we developed a high-throughput method for detecting motile cilia uncoordination by rotational polarity. Together, our data show that super-resolution methods are powerful tools for improving diagnosis of motile ciliopathies.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by an alteration in the ciliary structure causing difficulty in the clearance of respiratory secretions. Diagnosis is complex and based on a combination of techniques. The objective of this study was to design a gene panel including all known causative genes, and to corroborate their diagnostic utility in a cohort of Spanish patients. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of patients with a high suspicion of PCD, according to European Respiratory Society criteria, designed around a gene panel for massive sequencing using SeqCap EZ capture technology that included 44 genes associated with PCD. We included 79 patients, 53 of whom had a diagnosis of confirmed or highly probable PCD. The sensitivity of the gene panel was 81.1%, with a specificity of 100%. Candidate variants were found in some of the genes of the panel in 43 patients with PCD, 51.2% (22/43) of whom were homozygotes and 48.8% (21/43) compound heterozygotes. The most common causative genes were DNAH5 and CCDC39. We found 52 different variants, 36 of which were not previously described in the literature. The design and implementation of a tailored gene panel produces a high yield in the genetic diagnosis of PCD. This panel provides a better understanding of the causative factors involved in these patients and lays down the groundwork for future therapeutic approaches.

"	"Recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract are one of the major clinical features of the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disease due to malfunctioning of motile cilia. Chronic infections and persistent inflammation of the respiratory system result in progressive lung disease. Aim of the study was to highlight the main factors associated with clinical, functional and anatomical deterioration in PCD patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 58 patients with PCD, 37 adults and 21 children. The demographic and clinical data, forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), sputum microbiology and imaging results (chest CT scores-modified Bhalla) were recorded. Patients were stratified according to the number of exacerbations (< 2/year vs ≥ 2/year) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization. The possible correlations between lung function and chest CT scores were assessed; we also evaluated the correlation between these parameters and the severity scores for bronchiectasis (BSI, FACED and e-FACED). Chest CT scores showed a significant correlation with FEV1 (p = 0.0002), age (p <  0.0001), BMI (p = 0.0002) and number of lung lobes involved (p <  0.0001). PA colonization had an overall prevalence of 32.6%: no significant difference in FEV1 between PA colonized and non-colonized patients was found (p = 0.70), while chest CT score was significantly worse in chronic PA colonized patients (p = 0.009). Patients with a high number of exacerbation (≥ 2/year) were older (p = 0.01), had lower FEV1 (p = 0.03), greater number of lobes involved (p < 0.001) and worse CT score than patients with low number of exacerbations (p = 0.001); they also had higher prevalence of PA chronic bronchial infection (33.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.10). Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for gender, age and BMI showed positive associations between PA colonization and number of exacerbations with severity of disease (number of lobes involved, CT score, BSI, FACED, and e-FACED). In our PCD population the number of exacerbations (≥ 2/year) and PA colonization were the two most relevant factors associated with severity of disease.

"	"Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD. The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</≥ 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0·75 (SD 1·12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1·62 (1·64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·26-0·78]; p=0·004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

32431532	"Anesthesia During Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery for Kartagener's Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review
"	"Kartagener's syndrome (KS) is a ciliopathic, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The abnormal ciliary structure and function lead to variable clinical manifestations, including dextrocardia, pneumonia, bronchitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, reduced fertility in women, and infertility in men. This article reports our experience on general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in a patient with KS. A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with chronic nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, chronic sinusitis, and chronic non-productive cough for FESS. The patient's heart was on the right side of his chest. A chest roentgenogram and a high﻿-resolution chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan identified dextrocardia, situs inversus, and chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis involving both lung bases. CT sinuses showed mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary and ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The patient was prescribed oral medications and nasal spray for crepitations and wheezes heard over bilateral lung fields. Intensive chest physiotherapy and supportive care prior to surgery were provided to prevent worsening of lung function. FESS with bilateral frontal polypectomy was performed. All hemodynamic parameters were stable. The emergence from anesthesia was smooth. After ~20 minutes in the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was fully awake and pain-free. He was then transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and subsequently to the ward. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient felt subjectively ""very well"" and was discharged from the hospital on the 2nd postoperative day. Anesthesiologists must be aware of cardiopulmonary inversion that could challenge the management of patients with KS. To avoid respiratory depression caused by long-acting systemic opioids, we suggest using short-acting opioids during general anesthesia and for postoperative pain relief.

32482850	"CAMSAP3 facilitates basal body polarity and the formation of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia
"	"Synchronized beating of cilia on multiciliated cells (MCCs) generates a directional flow of mucus across epithelia. This motility requires a ""9 + 2"" microtubule (MT) configuration in axonemes and the unidirectional array of basal bodies of cilia on the MCCs. However, it is not fully understood what components are needed for central MT-pair assembly as they are not continuous with basal bodies in contrast to the nine outer MT doublets. In this study, we discovered that a homozygous knockdown mouse model for MT minus-end regulator calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3), Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , exhibited multiple phenotypes, some of which are typical of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition caused by motile cilia defects. Anatomical examination of Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  mice revealed severe nasal airway blockage and abnormal ciliary morphologies in nasal MCCs. MCCs from different tissues exhibited defective synchronized beating and ineffective generation of directional flow likely underlying the PCD-like phenotypes. In normal mice, CAMSAP3 localized to the base of axonemes and at the basal bodies in MCCs. However, in Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , MCCs lacked CAMSAP3 at the ciliary base. Importantly, the central MT pairs were missing in the majority of cilia, and the polarity of the basal bodies was disorganized. These phenotypes were further confirmed in MCCs of Xenopus embryos when CAMSAP3 expression was knocked down by morpholino injection. Taken together, we identified CAMSAP3 as being important for the formation of central MT pairs, proper orientation of basal bodies, and synchronized beating of motile cilia.

Although the main features remain similar, etiologies seem to change. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of our recent non-CF bronchiectasis patients and to compare these with our historical cohort in 2001. One hundred four children with non-CF bronchiectasis followed between 2002 and 2019 were enrolled. Age of diagnosis, underlying etiology and microorganisms in sputum culture were recorded. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of lung function tests and annual pulmonary exacerbation rates at presentation and within the last 12 months. Mean FEV1 and FVC %predicted at presentation improved compared to historical cohort (76.6 ± 17.1 vs. 63.3 ± 22.1 and 76.6 ± 15.1 vs. 67.3 ± 23.1, respectively; p <  0.001). There was a significant decrease in pulmonary exacerbation rate from 6.05 ± 2.88 at presentation to 3.23 ± 2.08 during follow-up (p <  0.0001). In 80.8% of patients, an underlying etiology was identified.

Genetic mutations in multiple genes impair the ability of patients to clear mucous from the lungs, middle ear, and sinonasal cavity and lead to chronic pulmonary and sinonasal symptoms. We identified 17 PCD patients who had available CT scans. Volumes for bilateral maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses were calculated. A control population of patients who had preoperative CT scans for endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base pathology without sinonasal cavity involvement was also identified. The mean age of PCD was 33 and ranged from 13 to 54 years. Patients were age- and gender-matched to a control group that underwent resection of anterior skull-base tumors and had a mean age of 35 that ranged between 17-53 years old. The volumes for all thee sinus cavities were significantly smaller (p < 0.007) compared to the control population. The average Lund-Mackay score was 10.6 in the PCD cohort (range 6-16) in comparison to an average of 0.7 in the control cohort (range 0-2). Overall sinus volumes were smaller in patients with PCD compared to our control population. Future studies will be aimed at understanding defects in sinus development as a function of specific genetic mutations in PCD patients. Ultimately, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of PCD will allow us to identify the optimal treatment practices for this unique patient group.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, ciliopathic disorder. In many ciliopathies, dental anomalies are observed alongside other symptoms of the disease. To date, there are no published reports concerning the dental developmental problems that are associated with ciliary defects in PCD patients.

Then, three-dimensional radiographic examination was performed utilising Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Four PCD patients, aged 31-54, agreed to enter the study. Dental examinations showed the presence of dental developmental disorders in three of them. Additionally, CBCT showed abnormalities in those patients. 1. The dental phenotype in PCD patients seems to be heterogeneous. Tooth developmental disorders resulting from abnormal odontogenesis may be a symptom of PCD that is concomitant with other developmental abnormalities resulting from malfunctioning primary cilia. 2. Patients with ciliopathies are likely to develop dental developmental defects. Therefore, beginning in early childhood, they should be included in a targeted specialised dental programme to enable early diagnosis and to ensure dedicated preventive and therapeutic measures.

"	"Rationale: In cystic fibrosis (CF), the lung clearance index (LCI), derived from multiple breath washout (MBW), is more sensitive in detecting early lung disease than FEV1; MBW has been less thoroughly evaluated in young patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).Objectives: Our objectives were 1) to evaluate the sensitivity of MBW and spirometry for the detection of mild lung disease in young children with PCD and CF compared with healthy control (HC) subjects and 2) to compare patterns of airway obstruction between disease populations.Methods: We used a multicenter, single-visit, observational study in children with PCD and CF with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than 60% predicted and HC subjects, ages 3-12 years. Nitrogen MBW and spirometry were performed and overread for acceptability. χ2 and Kruskall-Wallis tests compared demographics and lung function measures between groups, linear regression evaluated the effect of disease state, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient compared the LCI and spirometric measurements.Results: Twenty-five children with PCD, 49 children with CF, and 80 HC children were enrolled, among whom 17 children with PCD (68%), 36 children with CF (73%), and 53 (66%) HC children performed both acceptable spirometry and MBW; these children made up the analytic cohort. The median age was 9.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.8-11.1). The LCI was abnormal (more than 7.8) in 10 of 17 (59%) patients with PCD and 21 of 36 (58%) patients with CF, whereas FEV1 was abnormal in three of 17 (18%) patients with PCD and six of 36 (17%) patients with CF. The LCI was significantly elevated in patients with PCD and CF compared with HC subjects (ratio of geometric mean vs. HC: PCD 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.39; and CF 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33]). Children with PCD had lower midexpiratory-phase forced expiratory flow % predicted compared with children with CF (62% [IQR, 50-78%] vs. 85% [IQR, 68-99%]; P = 0.05). LCI did not correlate with FEV1.Conclusions: The LCI is more sensitive than FEV1 in detecting lung disease in young patients with PCD, similar to CF. LCI holds promise as a sensitive endpoint for the assessment of early PCD lung disease.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome that results from defects in motile cilia. The ciliary axoneme has a 9 + 2 microtubule structure consisting of nine peripheral doublets surrounding a central pair apparatus (CPA), which plays a critical role in regulating proper ciliary function. We have previously shown that mouse models with mutations in CPA genes CFAP221, CFAP54, and SPEF2 have a PCD phenotype with defects in ciliary motility. In this study, we investigated potential genetic interaction between these CPA genes by generating each combination of double heterozygous and double homozygous mutants. No detectable cilia-related phenotypes were observed in double heterozygotes, but all three double homozygous mutant lines exhibit early mortality and typically develop severe PCD-associated phenotypes of hydrocephalus, mucociliary clearance defects in the upper airway, and abnormal spermatogenesis. Double homozygous cilia are generally intact and display a normal morphology and distribution. Spermiogenesis is aborted in double homozygotes, with an absence of mature flagella on elongating spermatids and epididymal sperm. These findings identify genetic interactions between CPA genes and genetic mechanisms regulating the CPA and motile cilia function.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) causes chronic infections and progressive bronchiectasis that can lead to severe lung disease. Because there are no cures or regenerative therapy options for PCD, treatment of severe lung disease in PCD is focused on managing symptoms, including aggressive administration of antibiotics and diligent airway clearance. The Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) does not recommend routine lobectomy, reserving its use for ""rare cases of PCD with severe, localized bronchiectasis"" and warns that a lobectomy should be treated with caution. However, if aggressive medical management fails, selective surgical removal of severely defective lung may result in maintenance or improvement of pulmonary function. Certainly, the decision to recommend lung resection in the face of chronic bronchiectasis from PCD requires an extensive discussion before it is considered as an alternative treatment. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate that in selected cases of unilobar disease with bronchiectasis that are not responsive to other therapies (antibiotics and airway clearance), removal of localized necrotic areas of the lung along with prophylactic antibiotics can improve the quality of life of children with PCD associated bronchiectasis and improve growth and nutritional status, and pulmonary function.

"	"To report a neuroradiologic phenotype associated with reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) and mutations in the multicilin gene. We hypothesize that the observed phenotype may reflect the emerging role that ependymal cilia play in regulating CSF production. Clinical and radiologic records were retrospectively reviewed for 7 consecutive patients diagnosed by the Leicester UK national primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostic laboratory. On MRI scanning, all patients demonstrated hydrocephalus, choroid plexus hyperplasia (CPH), and arachnoid cysts. No patient had any sign of neurologic deficit. All patients had significant lung disease. We conclude that there is a high incidence of hydrocephalus, arachnoid cysts, and CPH in MCIDAS-associated RGMC. In all cases, the observed hydrocephalus seems arrested in childhood without progression or adverse neurologic sequelae. Our new observation of CPH, which is associated with CSF overproduction, is the first macroscopic evidence that ependymal cilia may be involved in the regulation of CSF production and flow. We suggest that brain imaging should be performed in all cases of RGMC and that a diagnosis of PCD or RGMC be strongly considered in patients with unexplained hydrocephalus and a lifelong ""wet""-sounding cough.

The electrocardiogram showed inverted ""P"" waves in L1 and AVL on left-sided chest leads and computed tomography scan of the chest showed bronchiectasis changes, cardiac shadow and apex on the right side, and situs inversus of aortic arch position. The digital subtraction angiography showed inversion of the aortic arch, and bilateral internal carotid arteries are occluded from the ophthalmic segment. The clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings made the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome and moyamoya syndrome. The whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed a homozygotic nonsense mutation in DNAH5 gene, and heterozygotic missense mutation in the DNAH11 gene. The combined mutation of DNAH5 and DNAH11 may lead to the overlapping dysfunction of motile and nonmotile cilia, which contribute to the co-occurrence of Kartagener syndrome and moyamoya syndrome. Our report deserves further confirm by more case reports.

32897366	"OFD Type I syndrome: lessons learned from a rare ciliopathy.
"	"The OFD1 gene was initially identified as the gene responsible for the X-linked dominant male lethal OFD type I syndrome, a developmental disorder ascribed to cilia disfunction. The transcript has been subsequently associated to four different X-linked recessive conditions, namely Joubert syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, primary ciliary dyskinesia and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel type 2 syndrome. The centrosomal/basal body OFD1 protein has indeed been shown to be required for primary cilia formation and left-right asymmetry. The protein is also involved in other tasks, e.g. regulation of cellular protein content, constrain of the centriolar length, chromatin remodeling at DNA double strand breaks, control of protein quality balance and cell cycle progression, which might be mediated by non-ciliary activities. OFD1 represents a paradigmatic model of a protein that performs its diverse actions according to the cell needs and depending on the subcellular localization, the cell type/tissue and other possible factors still to be determined. An increased number of multitask protein, such as OFD1, may represent a partial explanation to human complexity, as compared with less complex organisms with an equal or slightly lower number of proteins.

"	"Neonatal respiratory distress (NRD) is common among infants with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but we do not know whether affected neonates receive a timely diagnosis. We used data from the international PCD cohort and assessed the proportion of patients with PCD who had a history of NRD and their age at diagnosis, stratifying by presence of laterality defects. First we analyzed data from all participants diagnosed after 2000, followed by individuals from a subgroup diagnosed using stricter criteria. Among the 1375 patients in the study, 45% had a history of NRD and 42% had laterality defects. Out of the 476 children with definite PCD diagnosis, 55% had a history of NRD and 50% had laterality defects. Overall, 30% of children with PCD were diagnosed during the first 12 months of life. This varied from 13% in those with situs solitus and no NRD, to 21% in those with situs solitus and NRD, 33% in those with situs anomalies but no NRD, and 52% in those with both situs anomalies and NRD. Our results suggest that we need to improve our knowledge of the neonatal presentation of infants with PCD and apply it so that these patients will receive appropriate care sooner.

"	"Chest computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for detecting structural abnormalities in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) such as bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and mucus plugging. There are no studies on quantitative assessment of airway and artery abnormalities in children with PCD. The objectives of the present study were to quantify airway and artery dimensions on chest CT in a cohort of children with PCD and compare these with control children to analyse the influence of covariates on airway and artery dimensions. Chest CTs of 13 children with PCD (14 CT scans) and 12 control children were collected retrospectively. The bronchial tree was segmented semi-automatically and reconstructed in a three-dimensional view. All visible airway-artery (AA) pairs were measured perpendicular to the airway centre line, annotating per branch inner and outer airway and adjacent artery diameter and computing inner airway diameter/artery ratio (AinA ratio), outer airway diameter/artery ratio (AoutA ratio), wall thickness (WT), WT/outer airway diameter ratio (Awt ratio) and WT/artery ratio. In the children with PCD (38.5% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 9.8-15.3) 1526 AA pairs were measured versus 1516 in controls (58.3% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 8-14.8). AinA ratio and AoutA ratio were significantly higher in children with PCD than in control children (both p<0.001). Awt ratio was significantly higher in control children than in children with PCD (p<0.001). Our study showed that in children with PCD airways are more dilated than in controls and do not show airway wall thickening.

32977348	"Management of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, MIM 242650) is a rare, hereditary multiorgan disease characterized by malfunction of motile cilia. Hallmark symptom is a chronic airway infection due to mucostasis leading to irreversible lung damage that may progress to respiratory failure. There is no cure for this genetic disease and evidence-based treatment is limited. Until recently, there were no randomized controlled trials performed in PCD, but this year, data of the first placebo-controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD were published. This cornerstone in the management of PCD was decisive for reviewing currently used treatment strategies. This article is a consensus of patient representatives and clinicians, which are highly experienced in care of PCD-patients and provides an overview of the management of PCD. Treatments are mainly based on expert opinions, personal experiences, or are deduced from other lung diseases, notably cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD or bronchiectasis. Most strategies focus on routine airway clearance and treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infections. Non-respiratory symptoms are treated organ specific. To generate further evidence-based knowledge, other projects are under way, e. g. the International PCD-Registry. Participating in patient registries facilitates access to clinical and research studies and strengthens networks between centers. In addition, knowledge of genotype-specific course of the disease will offer the opportunity to further improve and individualize patient care.

32996775	"PCD Detect: enhancing ciliary features through image averaging and classification
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder of the motile cilia. Early accurate diagnosis is important to help prevent lung damage in childhood and to preserve lung function. Confirmation of a diagnosis traditionally relied on assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, >50 known PCD genes have made the identification of biallelic mutations a viable alternative to confirm diagnosis. TEM and genotyping lack sensitivity, and research to improve accuracy of both is required. TEM can be challenging when a subtle or partial ciliary defect is present or affected cilia structures are difficult to identify due to poor contrast. Here, we demonstrate software to enhance TEM ciliary images and reduce background by averaging ciliary features. This includes an option to classify features into groups based on their appearance, to generate multiple averages when a nonhomogeneous abnormality is present. We validated this software on images taken from subjects with well-characterized PCD caused by variants in the outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH5. Examining more difficult to diagnose cases, we detected 1) regionally restricted absence of the ODAs away from the ciliary base, in a subject carrying mutations in DNAH9; 2) loss of the typically poorly contrasted inner dynein arms; and 3) sporadic absence of part of the central pair complex in subjects carrying mutations in HYDIN, including one case with an unverified genetic diagnosis. We show that this easy-to-use software can assist in detailing relationships between genotype and ultrastructural phenotype, improving diagnosis of PCD.

"	"Chest physiotherapy (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella®) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients.

33005176	"Ultrastructural Sperm Flagellum Defects in a Patient With CCDC39  Compound Heterozygous Mutations and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia/Situs Viscerum Inversus 
"	"Introduction: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by structural or functional motile cilia abnormalities. Up to 40 different genes seem, at the moment, to be involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. A number of ultrastructural defects have also been reported in sperm flagella, but the sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) has never been described in these cases. Aim: The aim of this study was to report the sperm MMP and ultrastructural abnormalities of the sperm flagella found in a patient with PCD and situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome) and its characterization from the genetic point of view. Methods: Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to evaluate flagella ultrastructure. The genetic testing was performed by next-generation sequencing. Sperm DNA fragmentation and MMP were also evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: We report here the case of an 18-year-old male patient with PCD and situs inversus and severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. TEM analysis of his spermatozoa showed an abnormal connecting piece. The mid piece appeared abnormally thickened, with cytoplasmic residue, dysplasia of fibrous sheath, loss of the outer dynein arms (ODAs), truncated inner dynein arms, and supernumerary outer fibers. The percentage of spermatozoa with fragmented DNA was normal, whereas a high percentage of spermatozoa had low MMP, suggesting an altered mitochondrial function. The genetic analysis showed the presence of c.610-2A > G, p.Arg811Cys compound heterozygous mutations in the CCDC39 gene. Conclusion: The case herein reported suggests that the high percentage of sperm with low MMP may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthenozoospermia in patients with Kartagener syndrome. In addition, we report, for the first time, the missense variant p.Arg811Cys in the CCDC39 gene in a patient with Kartagener syndrome. Although in silico analysis predicts its damaging potential, its clinical meaning remains unclear.

"	"To aid in the diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and to evaluate the respiratory epithelium in respiratory disease, normal age-related reference ranges are needed for ciliary beat frequency (CBF), beat pattern and ultrastructure. Our aim was to establish reference ranges for healthy Chinese children. Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 135 healthy Chinese children aged below 18 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. CBF and beat pattern were analysed from high speed video recordings. Epithelial integrity and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed using transmission electronic microscopy. The mean CBF from 135 children studied was 10.1 Hz (95% CI 9.8 to 10.4). Approximately 20% (ranged 18.0-24.2%) of ciliated epithelial edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. Normal beat pattern was observed in ciliated epithelium from all subjects. We did not find any effect of exposure to second hand smoke on CBF in our subjects. Microtubular defects were found in 9.3% of all of the cilia counted in these children, while other ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 3%. We established the reference range for CBF, beat pattern and ultrastructure in healthy Chinese children. Using similar methodology, we found a lower overall mean CBF than previously obtained European values. This study highlights the need to establish normative data for ciliary function in different populations.

33118031	"Molecular genetics of infertility: loss-of-function mutations in humans and corresponding knockout/mutated mice
"	"Infertility is a major issue in human reproductive health, affecting an estimated 15% of couples worldwide. Infertility can result from disorders of sex development (DSD) or from reproductive endocrine disorders (REDs) with onset in infancy, early childhood or adolescence. Male infertility, accounting for roughly half of all infertility cases, generally manifests as decreased sperm count (azoospermia or oligozoospermia), attenuated sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) or a higher proportion of morphologically abnormal sperm (teratozoospermia). Female infertility can be divided into several classical types, including, but not limited to, oocyte maturation arrest, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest. An estimated one half of infertility cases have a genetic component; however, most genetic causes of human infertility are currently uncharacterized. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has greatly facilitated the identification of infertility-associated gene mutations in patients over the past 20 years. This review aims to conduct a narrative review of the genetic causes of human infertility. Loss-of-function mutation discoveries related to human infertility are summarized and further illustrated in tables. Corresponding knockout/mutated animal models of causative genes for infertility are also introduced. A search of the PubMed database was performed to identify relevant studies published in English. The term 'mutation' was combined with a range of search terms related to the core focus of the review: infertility, DSD, REDs, azoospermia or oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), globozoospermia, teratozoospermia, acrosome, oocyte maturation arrest, POI, zona pellucida, fertilization defects and early embryonic arrest. Our search generated ∼2000 records. Overall, 350 articles were included in the final review. For genetic investigation of human infertility, the traditional candidate gene approach is proceeding slowly, whereas high-throughput sequencing technologies in larger cohorts of individuals is identifying an increasing number of causative genes linked to human infertility. This review provides a wide panel of gene mutations in several typical forms of human infertility, including DSD, REDs, male infertility (oligozoospermia, MMAF, PCD, ASS and globozoospermia) and female infertility (oocyte maturation arrest, POI, fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest). The causative genes, their identified mutations, mutation rate, studied population and their corresponding knockout/mutated mice of non-obstructive azoospermia, MMAF, ASS, globozoospermia, oocyte maturation arrest, POI, fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest are further illustrated by tables. In this review, we suggest that (i) our current knowledge of infertility is largely obtained from knockout mouse models; (ii) larger cohorts of clinical cases with distinct clinical characteristics need to be recruited in future studies; (iii) the whole picture of genetic causes of human infertility relies on both the identification of more mutations for distinct types of infertility and the integration of known mutation information; (iv) knockout/mutated animal models are needed to show whether the phenotypes of genetically altered animals are consistent with findings in human infertile patients carrying a deleterious mutation of the homologous gene; and (v) the molecular mechanisms underlying human infertility caused by pathogenic mutations are largely unclear in most current studies. It is important to use our current understanding to identify avenues and priorities for future research in the field of genetic causes of infertility as well as to apply mutation knowledge to risk prediction, genetic diagnosis and potential treatment for human infertility.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder caused by defects in motile cilia. The hallmark features of PCD are the chronic infections of the respiratory tract, moreover, clinical manifestations include also laterality defects and risk of male infertility. Clinical phenotypes of PCD are the result of mutations in genes encoding components of axonema or factors involved in axonemal assembly. Recent studies have identified over 45 PCD-associated genes, therefore, molecular analysis represents a powerful diagnostic tool to confirm and uncover new genetic causes of this rare disease. Here, we describe a female infant of Moroccan origin with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in addition to most common PCD symptoms. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular tests, such as a Next generation Sequencing panel and a custom array CGH, were performed for diagnosis of PCD. TEM revealed outer dynein arm (ODA) defects, whilst molecular analyses detected a novel 6,9 kb microdeletion in DNAI2 gene. Since DNAI2 mutations are very rare, this case report contributes to better delineate the important role of DNAI2 as causative of PCD phenotype, suggesting, furthermore, that the variations in DNAI2 may be as a new genetic risk factor for NPH. Indeed, although the association of hydrocephalus with PCD has been well documented, however, only a small number of human patients show this defect. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of high-throughput technologies in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous genetic disorders.

"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic motile ciliopathy, leading to significant otosinopulmonary disease. PCD diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to challenges with different diagnostic modalities. Ciliary videomicroscopy, using Digital High-Speed Videomicroscopy (DHSV), one of the diagnostic tools for PCD, is considered the optimal method to perform ciliary functional analysis (CFA), comprising of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and beat pattern (CBP) analysis. However, DHSV lacks standardized, published operating procedure for processing and analyzing samples. It also uses living respiratory epithelium, a significant infection control issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. To continue providing a diagnostic service during this health crisis, the ciliary videomicroscopy protocol has been adapted to include adequate infection control measures. Here, we describe a revised protocol for sampling and laboratory processing of ciliated respiratory samples, highlighting adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control measures. Representative results of CFA from nasal brushing samples obtained from 16 healthy subjects, processed and analyzed according to this protocol, are described. We also illustrate the importance of obtaining and processing optimal quality epithelial ciliated strips, as samples not meeting quality selection criteria do now allow for CFA, potentially decreasing the diagnostic reliability and the efficiency of this technique.

"	"Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of nasal epithelial cells is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and research of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Ex vivo samples often display secondary dyskinesia from cell damage during sampling, infection or inflammation confounding PCD diagnostic results. ALI culture enables regeneration of healthy cilia facilitating differentiation of primary from secondary ciliary dyskinesia. We describe a revised ALI culture method adopted from April 2018 across three collaborating PCD diagnostic sites, including current University Hospital Southampton COVID-19 risk mitigation measures, and present results. Two hundred and forty nasal epithelial cell samples were seeded for ALI culture and 199 (82.9%) were ciliated. Fifty-four of 83 (63.9%) ex vivo samples which were originally equivocal or insufficient provided diagnostic information following in vitro culture. Surplus basal epithelial cells from 181 nasal brushing samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen; 39 samples were ALI-cultured after cryostorage and all ciliated. The ciliary beat patterns of ex vivo samples (by high-speed video microscopy) were recapitulated, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated excellent ciliation, and cilia could be immuno-fluorescently labelled (anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-RSPH4a) in representative cases that were ALI-cultured after cryostorage. In summary, our ALI culture protocol provides high ciliation rates across three centres, minimising patient recall for repeat brushing biopsies and improving diagnostic certainty. Cryostorage of surplus diagnostic samples was successful, facilitating PCD research.

"	"Cilia are highly conserved in most eukaryotes and are regarded as an important organelle for motility and sensation in various species. Cilia are microscopic, hair-like cytoskeletal structures that protrude from the cell surface. The major focus in studies of cilia has been concentrated on the ciliary dysfunction in vertebrates that causes multisymptomatic diseases, which together are referred to as ciliopathies. To date, the understanding of ciliopathies has largely depended on the study of ciliary structure and function in different animal models. Zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10) is a ciliary protein that was recently found to be mutated in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In Paramecium tetraurelia, we identified two ZMYND10 genes, arising from a whole-genome duplication. Using RNAi, we found that the depletion of ZMYND10 in P. tetraurelia causes severe ciliary defects, thus provoking swimming dysfunction and lethality. Moreover, we found that the absence of ZMYND10 caused the abnormal localization of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT43 along cilia. These results suggest that ZMYND10 is involved in the regulation of ciliary function and IFT, which may contribute to the study of PCD pathogenesis.

However, a standardised genetic panel is not widely available and new disease-causing genes are continuously identified. To assess the accuracy of untargeted whole-exome sequencing (WES) as a diagnostic tool for PCD, patients with symptoms highly suggestive of PCD were consecutively included. Patients underwent measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels, ciliary transmission electron microscopy analysis (TEM) and WES. A confirmed PCD diagnosis in symptomatic patients was defined as a recognised ciliary ultrastructural defect on TEM and/or two pathogenic variants in a known PCD-causing gene. Forty-eight patients (46% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 10.0 years (range 1.0-37 years). In 36 patients (75%) a diagnosis of PCD was confirmed, of which 14 (39%) patients had normal TEM. A standalone untargeted WES had a diagnostic yield of 94%, identifying bi-allelic variants in 11 known PCD-causing genes in 34 subjects. A nNO<77 nL·min was nonspecific when including patients younger than 5 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.90). Consecutive WES considerably improved the diagnostic accuracy of nNO in young children (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1). Finally, WES established an alternative diagnosis in four patients. In patients with clinically suspected PCD and low nNO levels, WES is a simple, beneficial and accurate next step to confirm the diagnosis of PCD or suggest an alternative diagnosis, especially in preschool-aged children in whom nNO is less specific.

33589394	"Multifaceted analysis of Japanese cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia: Value of immunofluorescence for ciliary protein detection in patients with DNAH5 and DNAH11 mutations.
"	"Multifaceted analysis is recommended for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A 31-year-old woman had situs inversus, bronchiectasis, family history of PCD, and compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5. Her cilia were immotile. Defects in the outer dynein arms were revealed by transmission electron microscopy and loss of DNAH5 proteins in the entire length of axonemes using immunofluorescence (IF). A 17-year-old boy had bronchiectasis and heterozygous mutations in DNAH11. His cilia were motile with normal ultrastructure. The loss of DNAH11 proteins at the proximal region of cilia was revealed by IF. IF could be useful to support PCD diagnosis.

33608380	"Transcript analysis for variant classification resolution in a child with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
"	"Transcriptional analysis can be utilized to reconcile variants of uncertain significance, particularly those predicted to impact splicing. Laboratory analysis of the predicted mRNA transcript may allow inference of the in vivo impact of the variant and aid prediction of its clinical significance. We present a patient with classical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) who was identified to have compound heterozygous variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.10691 + 2T > C, c.13523_13543dup21) via trio whole-exome sequencing in 2013. These variants were originally classified as Mutation and Likely Mutation. However, these variants were downgraded to variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) during reanalysis in 2016 because of uncertainty that they caused a loss of function of the gene. c.10691 + 2T > C is predicted to abrogate the canonical splice site and lead to the skipping of exon 65, but the adjoining of exon 64 and exon 66 in the DNAH11 transcript preserves the reading frame of the resultant protein. c.13523_13543dup21 is located in the last exon of the DNAH11 coding sequence, upstream of the canonical stop codon, which suggests a reduced likelihood to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Transcriptional analysis was performed to characterize the impact of the variants, resulting in reclassification of c.10691 + 2T > C to Likely Pathogenic by providing evidence that it results in a deleterious effect and subsequent downstream reclassification of c.13523\_13543dup21 to Likely Pathogenic as well. Our case illustrates the potential impact of transcriptional analysis on variant resolution, supporting its usage on variants that exert an unpredictable effect on splicing.

33635012	"Genetic Analysis of Korean Adult Patients with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Suspected of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Using Whole Exome Sequencing.
"	"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is ubiquitous in the environment, but NTM lung disease (NTM-LD) is uncommon. Since exposure to NTM is inevitable, patients who develop NTM-LD are likely to have specific susceptibility factors, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia and is characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection, organ laterality defect, and infertility. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and investigated the genetic characteristics of adult NTM patients with suspected PCD. WES was performed in 13 NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD by clinical symptoms and/or ultrastructural ciliary defect observed by transmission electron microscopy. A total of 45 PCD-causing genes, 23 PCD-candidate genes, and 990 ciliome genes were analyzed. Four patients were found to have biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the following PCD-causing genes: CCDC114, DNAH5, HYDIN, and NME5. In four other patients, only one LoF variant was identified, while the remaining five patients did not have any LoF variants. At least 30.8% of NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD had biallelic LoF variants, and an additional 30.8% of patients had one LoF variant. Therefore, PCD should be considered in patients with NTM-LD with symptoms or signs suspicious of PCD.

33635866	"Defects in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms cause morphological abnormalities and dysmotility in sperm cells leading to male infertility.
"	"Axonemal protein complexes, such as outer (ODA) and inner (IDA) dynein arms, are responsible for the generation and regulation of flagellar and ciliary beating. Studies in various ciliated model organisms have shown that axonemal dynein arms are first assembled in the cell cytoplasm and then delivered into axonemes during ciliogenesis. In humans, mutations in genes encoding for factors involved in this process cause structural and functional defects of motile cilia in various organs such as the airways and result in the hereditary disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite extensive knowledge about the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms in respiratory cilia, this process is still poorly understood in sperm flagella. To better define its clinical relevance on sperm structure and function, and thus male fertility, further investigations are required. Here we report the fertility status in different axonemal dynein preassembly mutant males (DNAAF2/ KTU, DNAAF4/ DYX1C1, DNAAF6/ PIH1D3, DNAAF7/ZMYND10, CFAP300/C11orf70 and LRRC6). Besides andrological examinations, we functionally and structurally analyzed sperm flagella of affected individuals by high-speed video- and transmission electron microscopy as well as systematically compared the composition of dynein arms in sperm flagella and respiratory cilia by immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, we analyzed the flagellar length in dynein preassembly mutant sperm. We found that the process of axonemal dynein preassembly is also critical in sperm, by identifying defects of ODAs and IDAs in dysmotile sperm of these individuals. Interestingly, these mutant sperm consistently show a complete loss of ODAs, while some respiratory cilia from the same individual can retain ODAs in the proximal ciliary compartment. This agrees with reports of solely one distinct ODA type in sperm, compared to two different ODA types in proximal and distal respiratory ciliary axonemes. Consistent with observations in model organisms, we also determined a significant reduction of sperm flagellar length in these individuals. These findings are relevant to subsequent studies on the function and composition of sperm flagella in PCD patients and non-syndromic infertile males. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the fertility status in PCD-affected males and should help guide genetic and andrological counselling for affected males and their families.

33711958	"Crazy-paving patterns as rare radiological manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis: a case report.
"	"Crazy-paving patterns are rarely reported as radiological manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Herein, we presented a very rare case of a crazy-paving pattern as a radiological manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia was ultimately confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy, fungus culture, whole exome sequencing of blood, etc. The patient received flucytosine (PO, 5 g per day) and amphotericin B (IV, 70 mg per day) during hospitalization and sequential therapy with voriconazole (PO, 200 mg twice a day) after discharge. He recovered during follow-up. We concluded that pulmonary cryptococcosis should be considered a possible cause of crazy-paving patterns in chest CT scans.

33719352	"Case Report: Identification of a Novel ODAD3 Variant in a Patient With Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.
"	"Background:ODAD3 encodes a protein of 595 amino acids and contain three highly conserved coiled-coil domains, which is essential for cilia axoneme dynein arm assembly and docking. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) of ODAD3 deficiency are rarely reported. Female infertility in PCD related to ODAD3 variants has not been reported. Methods: Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the disease-related gene of the patient with PCD in a consanguineous Chinese family. Domain analysis was applied to predict the impact of the variant on ODAD3 protein. Results: The 35 year-old female patient exhibited chronic sinusitis, diffuse bronchiectasis, dextrocardia and infertility. We identified a novel homozygous variant in ODAD3, c.1166\_1169dupAGAC, p.(Leu391Aspfs\*105) in the PCD patient by exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. This frameshift variant was predicted to be disease causing by bioinformatics analysis and was also not presented in the current authorized large genetic databases. Conclusions: Our study enriches the genetic spectrum and clinical phenotypes of ODAD3 variants in PCD and provide more evidence for future genetic counseling and gene-targeted therapy for this disease.
