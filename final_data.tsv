19403253	"Hereditary hemorragic telangiectasia and hepatic abcess
"	"We report the case of a 27-year-old man presenting with a hepatic abscess and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The association between HHT and an infectious disease seemed to be induced by arteriovenous malformations and maybe also by a deficit of polymorphonuclear cells, a monocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis. This diagnosis should be suggested in case of serious infections in young patients. Prevention is based on screening for and destroying infection, antibioprophylaxis and embolization of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"Arteriovenous malformations may lead to right-heart failure in cases of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two rare AV-malformations with left-to-right shunting and progressive right-heart failure in a single individual.

20042635	"ALK5 phosphorylation of the endoglin cytoplasmic domain regulates Smad1/5/8 signaling and endothelial cell migration
"	"Endoglin, an endothelial cell-specific transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor, has an essential role in angiogenesis. Endoglin-null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype due to defects in angiogenesis and mutations in endoglin result in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I. Increased endoglin expression in the proliferating endothelium of tumors has been correlated with metastasis, tumor grade and decreased survival. Although endoglin is thought to regulate TGF-beta superfamily signaling in endothelial cells through regulating the balance between two TGF-beta-responsive pathways, the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad2/3 pathway and the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1/5/8 pathway, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis has not been defined. Here, we investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and its phosphorylation by ALK5 in regulating endoglin function in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin is basally phosphorylated by ALK5, primarily on serines 646 and 649, in endothelial cells. Functionally, the loss of phosphorylation at serine 646 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to TGF-beta and endothelial cell migration, whereas loss of phosphorylation at both serines 646 and 649 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to bone morphogenetic protein-9. Taken together, these results support endoglin phosphorylation by ALK5 as an important mechanism for regulating TGF-beta superfamily signaling and migration in endothelial cells.

20042709	"Spontaneous adult-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to increased endothelial oxidative stress in a murine model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

20067780	"Reduced plasma levels of Ang-2 and sEng as novel biomarkers in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by telangiectases and internal arteriovenous malformations caused by mutations in certain elements of the TGF-beta receptor complex. In the case of HHT1 mutations in the endoglin gene are responsible, whereas mutations in the ALK1 gene (an activin receptor-like kinase 1), lead to HHT2. Another two loci found at chromosome 5 and chromosome 7, whose target genes remain unidentified, lead to types 3 and 4 of the disease, respectively. Mutations in the MADH4/SMAD4 gene, another member of the TGF-beta signalling pathway, lead to a combined syndrome of familial juvenile polyposis associated with HHT. In an attempt to identify some soluble components differentially expressed in the plasma of HHT patients, angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin concentrations were analyzed with standard quantitative sandwich ELISA. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin levels are reduced in plasma of HHT patients compared to control individuals, and a diagnostic algorithm for HHT based on these protein levels is proposed. Down-regulated protein levels of angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin in plasma represent novel HHT biomarkers that could be useful in the biochemical diagnosis of HHT facilitating the rapid identification of potential HHT patients.

"	"To evaluate and describe pancreatic involvement by using multidetector computed tomography (CT) in patients with a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided informed consent. Across 12 months, all consecutive adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT referred to our pluridisciplinary HHT center for evaluation were enrolled prospectively in the study and underwent contrast material-enhanced multidetector CT of the abdomen. Pancreatic telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas were noted, and their characteristics were described. Genetic mutation was also investigated. Thirty-five patients (19 women, 16 men; mean age, 48.4 years) were included. All patients were asymptomatic. A genetic mutation was identified in 28 (80%) patients, including endoglin in 16 (57%), activin type-II-like receptor kinase 1 (ALK1) in 11 (39%), and SMAD4 in one (4%). Eleven (31%) patients exhibited pancreatic involvement. Fifty-four percent of patients with ALK1 mutation had pancreatic involvement. Twenty-three pancreatic telangiectases were identified during the arterial phase in nine patients. Seven pancreatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified in four patients. Pancreatic involvement commonly is found in patients with HHT (31% in our study), mainly in patients with ALK1 mutation; pancreatic telangiectases or AVMs are only diagnosed duringthe arterial phase at multidetector CT.

"	"A 53-year-old woman with no classic risk factors for aneurysm disease presented with the sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea. A large descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with focal type B dissection was identified and excluded by emergency thoracic endografting. Further postoperative evaluation revealed a history of epistaxis, perioral telangiectasias, hepatic hypervascularity, and a mutation in the gene expressing activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), leading to a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Aortic aneurysms associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are extremely rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of thoracic endografting in this patient population.

20170910	"High diagnostic and clinical impact of small-bowel capsule endoscopy in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with overt digestive bleeding and/or severe anemia
"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often present with recurrent anemia because of epistaxis or GI bleeding in relation to telangiectases mostly located in the stomach or small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood. To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Prospective, descriptive study. Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007. This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy investigation. Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences. Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7%) and 26 (86.7%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7% of patients. Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation. This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.

We present two patients who survived following emergent embolization. Definitive thoracentesis was delayed until embolization was performed. The tamponade provided by the hemothorax may have prevented exsanguination, suggesting to us that drainage of blood from the pleural space should be delayed until the PAVM has been treated. Hemorrhage from a PAVM may be the first manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Genetic testing and screening for other family members should be considered.

20224041	"Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin
"	"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation. Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM. In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina. Endoglin-deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs. Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.

As alternative treatment modalities repeatedly failed and the patient became almost permanently dependent on nasal dressing, we performed a highly conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the nasal cavity; a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy single fractions was applied. The therapy was very well tolerated, no acute toxicities occurred. Two weeks after the last radiation dose had been applied, the nasal dressing could be removed without problems. Endoscopical control revealed an almost avascular white mucosa without any trace of bleeding spots; previously existing hemangiomas and crusts had disappeared. After a 1-year-follow up, the patient had no significant recurrent epistaxis.

We report a case of hypoxic hepatitis in which hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber's disease) constituted this underlying condition and gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the triggering event. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypoxic hepatitis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with the exception of therapeutic ligation or embolization of the hepatic artery so as to decrease shunting of liver blood.

"	"To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of transcatheter embolotherapy for treating sporadic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) that were not associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Between January 2001 and June 2008, thirty-five sporadic PAVMs were detected in 23 patients. The clinical follow up consisted of assessing the changes of the signs and symptoms of the PAVMs, and radiological evaluation with chest radiographs or chest CT scans. The lower lung regions (63%) and peripheral locations (86%) were the common locations of the PAVMs. Thirty-four PAVMs (97%) had simple architecture (one arterial feeder within a single pulmonary segment). Technical success was achieved in 33 PAVMs (94%); two cases of technical failure were due to catheterization failure (n = 1) and too large a feeding artery (17 mm) that disabled embolotherapy (n = 1). Coils and Amplatz vascular plugs were used in 30 and three PAVMs, respectively. Inadvertent placement of one coil (n = 1) and pulmonary infarction (n = 1) occurred, but no relevant symptoms developed. For the 13 patients with available data, the mean arterial O(2) saturation changed significantly from 92% to 98%. Complete or near-complete involution of the sac was observed in 30 of the 33 embolized PAVMs (91%). In these 33 embolized PAVMs, the mean sac diameter significantly decreased from 17.83 mm to 0.68 mm. Sporadic PAVMs are mostly the simple type with predominance in the lower lobe and peripheral locations. Transcatheter embolotherapy with coils or Amplatz vascular plugs is a safe and effective treatment for sporadic PAVMs and this provides excellent functional and radiological improvement.

"	"This case report describes a lady who underwent investigations as a part of a clinical study. A 32-year-old woman with a history of episodes of severe migraine with aura, deep vein thrombosis and recurrent epistaxis, presented with two episodes of stroke with no particular cause evident on routine investigations. A contrast echocardiogram demonstrated a patent foramen ovale (PFO). She was found to be positive for the Factor V Leiden mutation. The PFO was closed percutaneously. However, a substantial right to left shunt of 14% persisted. Pulmonary angiography revealed multiple arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) and she was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The AVMs were embolized and she has had no further cerebral events. Interestingly, her episodes of 'migraine' have also improved dramatically following the closure of the PFO and the embolization of the AVMs. This case demonstrates the complex relationship between right to left shunts, cryptogenic stroke and migraine.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.

21310938	"Immunosuppressor FK506 increases endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression and modulates transforming growth factor-β1 signaling in endothelial cells
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Patients show severe epistaxis, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency. No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies. We report the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression. The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after hepatic failure due to a liver arteriovenous malformation. The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection. After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external telangiectases, epistaxes, and anemia disappeared. Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation.

"	"BACKROUNDS/PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Weber-Osler is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasia that may affect the nose, skin, lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well. Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Epistaxis is often the first and foremost symptom of the disease and recurrent epistaxis is the main complaint. Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of endovascular treatment of epistaxis in HHT patients. Between June 2004 and January 2008, 14 patients with HHT underwent embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches due to severe epistaxis. There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) or embospheres in diameter of 500-700-µm were used as an embolic material. Embolization was technically successful in 11 (78.5%) patients.

There were no severe complications after embolization. Nine patients experienced mild facial pain which resolved within three days after the treatment. Three patients in whom arterial spasm was observed, suffered from facial paraesthesia lasting for 3-5 days after embolization. Out of 14 patients, 12 were available for 24-month follow-up evaluation. All except one claimed reduction in frequency and severity of epistaxis which had a positive impact on their quality of life. Endovascular embolization of epistaxis in patients with HHT is an effective and safe procedure although it cannot provide a long-term cure in most cases. Embolization reduces the frequency, severity and duration of nasal bleeding in patients with HHT, improving patients' quality of life.

"	"Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

"	"Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.

"	"To evaluate the utility of transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) as a screening tool for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a single-center study of children who underwent baseline screening for PAVMs using both TTCE and chest computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of HHT. The CT and TTCE results were prospectively reviewed independently by 2 radiologists and 2 cardiologists blinded to the study results. Both intraobserver and interobserver agreement for interpreting TTCE results were excellent (κ = 0.97 and 0.92, respectively) and higher than the interobserver agreement for CT interpretation (κ = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of TTCE to predict PAVMs were 1 and 0.82, respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 0.39 and 1, respectively. TTCE is a sensitive test for PAVMs in children with suspected HHT and can be a useful initial screening tool in pediatric HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. The patient was treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months. Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.

22385575	"A novel ENG mutation causing impaired co-translational processing of endoglin associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in mainly the endoglin gene (ENG) or activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) gene (ACVRL1). We investigated the molecular basis of HHT in a Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation in ENG (c.38T>A, p.Leu13Gln) located in the signal peptide's hydrophobic core, but not in ACVRL1. In experiments in COS-1 cells, the Leu13Gln (L13Q) mutant endoglin appeared to be expressed as a precursor form, probably due to impaired protein processing. Flow cytometry analyses of the COS-1 cells transiently expressing recombinant endoglins revealed that the wild-type endoglin was detected on the cell surface, but the L13Q mutant was not. We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.

22421041	"ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway
"	"Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

"	"ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.

"	"BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicate BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation.

All HHT patients with dyspnea, consecutively seen at HHT reference center in Lyon between May 2007 and November 2009 were included and had hepatic vascular Ultrasound and Echocardiography. Echocardiographic measures included cardiac output (CO) and index (CI), left ventricle (LV) filling pressures, and pulmonary artery pressure. Then, patients were classified in 4 groups according to the severity: group 1 (normal values), group 2 with isolated high CI, group 3 with high CI and increased LV-filling pressures and group 4 with increased LV-filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-two HHT-patients were analyzed. Eight patients were in group 1, 25 in group 2, 6 in group 3 and 13 in group 4. Age, NYHA class dyspnea, edema, atrial fibrillation, hepatic artery diameter, and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels significantly increased from groups 1 to 4 as well as left atrial area, and presence of mitral regurgitation. Patients with associated pulmonary VMs (n=11) did not show any clinical or echocardiographic differences. Performing echocardiography in HHT patients with dyspnea allowed us to better understand the physiological processes of high-CO failure complicating liver vascular malformations and may improve follow-up of patients and treatment decisions.

23320130	"Oxidative stress contributes to endothelial dysfunction in mouse models of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) or activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1; HHT2) genes, coding for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily receptors. We demonstrated previously that endoglin and ALK1 interact with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and affect its activation. Endothelial cells deficient in endoglin or ALK1 proteins show eNOS uncoupling, reduced NO, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we measured NO and H(2)O(2) levels in several organs of adult Eng and Alk1 heterozygous mice, to ascertain whether decreased NO and increased ROS production is a generalized manifestation of HHT. A significant reduction in NO and increase in ROS production were found in several organs, known to be affected in patients. ROS overproduction in mutant mice was attributed to eNOS, as it was L-NAME inhibitable. Mitochondrial ROS contribution, blocked by antimycin, was highest in liver while NADPH oxidase, inhibited by apocynin, was a major source of ROS in the other tissues. However, there was no difference in antimycin- and apocynin-inhibitable ROS production between mutant and control mice. Our results indicate that eNOS-derived ROS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and likely predisposes to disease manifestations in several organs of HHT patients.

"	"The clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is based on the Curaçao criteria. Three out of four criteria are required for a definite clinical diagnosis HHT, two criteria are considered ""possible"" HHT, and 0 or 1 criterion makes the diagnosis unlikely. However, these consensus diagnostic criteria have not been validated. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical criteria. A total of 450 consecutive persons ≥16 years of age were screened for HHT between May 2004 and September 2009, including a chest CT to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We selected 263 first-degree relatives of disease-causing mutation carriers who underwent mutation analysis. Genetic test results were considered the gold standard. The family mutation was present in 186 patients (mean age 42.9 ± 14.6 yr; 54.8% female). A clinical diagnosis was definite, ""possible"", and unlikely in 168 (90.3%), 17 (9.1%), and 1 (0.5%) patient, respectively. In 77 persons the family mutation was absent (mean age 37.1 ± 12.3 yr, 59.7% female). In this group a clinical diagnosis was definite, possible, and unlikely in 0, 35 (45.5%), and 42 (54.5%) persons, respectively. The positive predictive value of a definite clinical diagnosis was 100% (95% CI 97.8-100), the negative predictive value of an unlikely diagnosis 97.7% (95% CI 87.9-99.6). Of 52 patients with ""possible"" HHT, 17 (32.7%) displayed an HHT-causing mutation. The Curaçao clinical criteria have a good diagnostic performance. Genetic testing is particularly helpful in patients with a ""possible"" clinical diagnosis HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1 account for around 85% of cases, and 10% are large deletions and duplications. Here we present a large novel deletion in ACVRL1 gene and its molecular characterization in a 3 generation Italian family. We employed short tandem repeats (STRs) analysis, direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, and 'deletion-specific' PCR methods. STRs Analysis at ENG and ACVRL1 loci suggested a positive linkage for ACVRL1. Direct sequencing of this gene did not identify any mutations, while MLPA identified a large deletion. These results were confirmed and exactly characterized with a 'deletion-specific' PCR: the deletion size is 4,594 bp and breakpoints in exon 3 and intron 8 show the presence of short direct repeats of 7 bp [GCCCCAC]. We hypothesize, as causative molecular mechanism, the replication slippage model. Understanding the fine mechanisms associated with genomic rearrangements may indicate the nonrandomness of these events, highlighting hot spots regions. The complete concordance among MLPA, STRs analysis and 'deletion-specific PCR' supports the usefulness of MLPA in HHT molecular analysis.

"	"When combined with local sphenopalatine (SP) injection and moderate hypotension, transoral or transcutaneous local injection of the anterior palatine (AP) vessels reduces intraoperative bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients undergoing nasal surgery. Retrospective chart review of 55 consecutive HHT patients undergoing a bevacizumab injection for recalcitrant epistaxis. Nineteen patients received local injections to only the SP vasculature, and 36 patients received AP and SP injections. Main outcome variable was estimated blood loss during nasal surgery. Independent variables included sex, age, epistaxis severity score, surgical techniques (including laser), and blood pressure parameters (baseline, preinduction, and postintubation). The mean blood loss in HHT patients receiving SP injections alone was 111 mL, whereas it was 22 mL for those receiving both AP + SP injections. This difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = .075). Blood pressure parameters were similar in both groups with no appreciable difference between intraoperative systolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The addition of either sublabial or transcutaneous AP injection to the standard SP block markedly reduces blood loss in HHT epistaxis nasal surgery.

23675457	"Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.

"	"Organs-on-chips are microengineered in vitro tissue structures that can be used as platforms for physiological and pathological research. They provide tissue-like microenvironments in which different cell types can be co-cultured in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ mimics. Blood vessels are an integral part of all tissues in the human body. Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of organs-on-chips since generated tissues will require a blood or nutrient supply. Here, we have engineered three-dimensional constructs of vascular tissue inside microchannels by injecting a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells) and rat tail collagen I into a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel with dimensions 500 μm × 120 μm × 1 cm (w × h × l). Over the course of 12 h, the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the channel. Detailed examination of tube morphology by confocal microscopy revealed a mature endothelial monolayer with complete PECAM-1 staining at cell-cell contacts and pericytes incorporated inside the tubular structures. We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for normal vascular development; deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and mutations in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic diseases. In the engineered microvessels, inhibition of TGF-β signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher tortuosity, highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). In summary, we have developed microengineered three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell types. In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue constructs to advance the development of organs-on-chips.

"	"The vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is in general an inherited disease caused by mutations in the TGF-β/BMP receptors endoglin or ALK1 or in rare cases by mutations of the TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad4 leading to the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT. HHT is characterized by several clinical symptoms like spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases at sites like lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose, and visceral lesions like gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations. The disease shows an inter- and intra-family variability in penetrance as well as symptoms from mild to life threatening. Penetrance is also depending on age. Diagnosis of the disease is based on the presence of some of the listed symptoms or by genetic testing. HHT diagnosis is laborious, time consuming, costly and sometimes uncertain. Not all typical symptoms may be present, especially at a younger age, and genetic testing does not always identify the disease causing mutation. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was investigated as a potential alternative to the current diagnostic methods. IR-spectra were obtained by Fourier-transform Mid-IR spectroscopy from blood plasma from HHT patients and a healthy control group. Spectral data were mathematically processed and subsequently classified and analysed by artificial neural network (ANN) analyses and by visual analysis of scatter plots of the dominant principal components. The analyses showed that for HHT a disease specific IR-spectrum exists that is significantly different from the control group. Furthermore, at the current stage with the here used methods, HHT can be diagnosed by Mid-IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%. Visual analysis of PCA scatter plots revealed an inter class variation of the HHT group. IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis can be considered to be a serious alternative diagnostic method compared to clinical and genetically based methods. Blood plasma is an ideal candidate for diagnostic purposes, it is inexpensive, easy to isolate and only minimal amounts are required. In addition, IR-spectroscopy measurement times are fast, less than one minute, and diagnosis is not based on interpretation of may be uncertain clinical data. And last but not least, the method is inexpensive.

Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM. A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM. We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis.

"	"Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT), also known as the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a multiorganic vascular disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Diagnostic clinical criteria include: epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance. HHT is transmitted in 90% of the cases as an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in either endoglin (ENG), or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) genes (HHT type 1 and 2, respectively). We have carried out a genetic analysis of four independent Spanish families with HHT clinical criteria, which has permitted the identification of new large deletions in ENG. These mutations were first detected using the MLPA technique and subsequently, the deletion breakpoints were mapped using a customized copy number variation (CNV) microarray. The array was designed to cover the ENG gene and surrounding areas. All tested families carried large deletions ranging from 3-kb to 100-kb, involving the ENG gene promoter, several ENG exons, and the two downstream genes FGSH and CDK9. Interestingly, common breakpoints coincident with Alu repetitive sequences were found among these families. The systematic hybridization of DNA from HHT families, with deletions or duplications, to custom designed microarrays, could allow the mapping of breakpoints, coincident with repetitive Alu sequences that might act as ""hot spots"" in the development of chromosomal anomalies.

Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

24273414	"Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted. The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years. Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.

She was found to have atypical atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Radiofrequency ablation was planned, but inferior vena cava interruption precluded right atrial (RA) access. The RA was then accessed through both subclavian veins, and activation mapping revealed a dense atriotomy scar in the posterolateral inferior RA. Wavefront propagation proceeded caudally through an area of slow conduction confined by the atriotomy scar. Atypical atrial flutter terminated during a second radiofrequency application to an isthmus confined by 2 regions of dense scar. The arrhythmia did not recur, although the patient later experienced typical atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. High-output heart failure due to systemic arteriovenous shunt was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and improved markedly with bevacizumab therapy.

"	"To identify whether relationships exist between epistaxis and migraines in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), to potentially provide further preventative and therapeutic options for the debilitating nosebleeds that are often very difficult to manage in clinical practice. Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. 4.

24489709	"ENDOGLIN is dispensable for vasculogenesis, but required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis
"	"ENDOGLIN (ENG) is a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members that is highly expressed in endothelial cells and has a critical function in the development of the vascular system. Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

"	"To describe pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a retrospective descriptive study of women with HHT (18-55 years of age) from the Toronto HHT Database using a telephone questionnaire regarding pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.

24520391	"Novel brain arteriovenous malformation mouse models for type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have a higher prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) than the general population and patients with other HHT subtypes. The pathogenesis of brain AVM in HHT1 patients is currently unknown and no specific medical therapy is available to treat patients. Proper animal models are crucial for identifying the underlying mechanisms for brain AVM development and for testing new therapies. However, creating HHT1 brain AVM models has been quite challenging because of difficulties related to deleting Eng-floxed sequence in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice. To create an HHT1 brain AVM mouse model, we used several Cre transgenic mouse lines to delete Eng in different cell-types in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice: R26CreER (all cell types after tamoxifen treatment), SM22α-Cre (smooth muscle and endothelial cell) and LysM-Cre (lysozyme M-positive macrophage). An adeno-associated viral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (AAV-VEGF) was injected into the brain to induce focal angiogenesis. We found that SM22α-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo caused AVMs in the postnatal brain, spinal cord, and intestines. Induction of Eng deletion in adult mice using R26CreER plus local VEGF stimulation induced the brain AVM phenotype. In both models, Eng-null endothelial cells were detected in the brain AVM lesions, and formed mosaicism with wildtype endothelial cells. However, LysM-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo did not cause AVM in the postnatal brain even after VEGF stimulation. In this study, we report two novel HHT1 brain AVM models that mimic many phenotypes of human brain AVM and can thus be used for studying brain AVM pathogenesis and testing new therapies. Further, our data indicate that macrophage Eng deletion is insufficient and that endothelial Eng homozygous deletion is required for HHT1 brain AVM development.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) play an important role in vascular repair and regeneration. This study was designed to examine the function of CACs derived from patients with HHT. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients with HHT and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed for expression of CD34, CD133 and VEGF receptor 2 by flow cytometry. PBMNCs were cultured to procure early outgrowth CACs. Development of endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in CACs was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CAC apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V staining, and CAC migration assessed by a modified Boyden chamber assay. mRNA expression of endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVLR1 or ALK1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in CACs was measured by real time RT-PCR. The percentage of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs from HHT patients was significantly higher than in PBMNCs of healthy controls. CACs derived from patients with HHT not only showed a significant reduction in EC-selective surface markers following 7-day culture, but also a significant increase in the rate of basal apoptosis and blunted migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. CACs from HHT patients expressed significantly lower levels of ENG, ALK1 and eNOS mRNAs. In conclusion, CACs from patients with HHT exhibited various functional impairments, suggesting a reduced regenerative capacity of CACs to repair the vascular lesions seen in HHT patients.

Forty-two patients from the HHT database with a definite clinical or genetic diagnosis of HHT with epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding and receiving TXA were included, and their Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), blood transfusions, and hospitalizations prior to and during TXA use were assessed. Among the 42 patients, 29 responded to the questionnaire (78.3 %). The ESS declined from a mean of 6.9 ± 2.7 to 4.3 ± 2.2 (p < 0.001), and there was a reduction in the percentage of patients receiving blood transfusion from 55.2 to 37.9 % (p = 0.095), hospitalizations from 58.6 to 37.9 % (p = 0.08), and medical care for epistaxis (i.e., clinic and/or emergency room visit) from 66.7 to 25.9 %. There was no difference in thrombosis (6.8 % before and during TXA use). TXA appears effective in the treatment of bleeding in patients with HHT, based on retrospective data.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is universally accepted as an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which represents telangiectasia is frequently multiple AVMs in internal organs. Very few non-HHT cases were diagnosed as cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We report one case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs diagnosed as non-HHT to share our experience. This report aims to find the way of identifying non-HHT case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs in early periods. To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.

"	"HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.

Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype.

However, most published cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias. We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also long-term survival of those with the disease. From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis (OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at death 3 years younger. Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is required.

"	"Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.

Patients were categorized as definite HHT if they met ≥3 clinical diagnostic criteria or had a positive genetic diagnosis. Patients were unlikely to have HHT (non-HHT) if they had 1 or fewer diagnostic criteria. Data on dyspnea prevalence (MMRC ≥ 1), PAVMs, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, symptomatic liver venous malformations, anemia and obesity was reviewed. 506 patients were categorized as having HHT, of which 202 (40%) had confirmed PAVMs. Dyspnea prevalence was 35% (178/506) vs. 18% (50/284, p < 0.0001) in the HHT and non-HHT patients, respectively. With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of dyspnea (MMRC ≥1) was 3.45 (95% CI 2.08-5.71) with the presence of PAVMs in HHT patients. Other independent predictors of dyspnea were older age, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, anemia, and obesity. Prevalence of dyspnea is significant, evident in about one-third of HHT patients, often associated with PAVMs. It is important to consider other etiologies for dyspnea when assessing patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is an autosomic dominant disorder, which is characterized by the development of multiple arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may either rupture or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism causing stroke or cerebral abscess. Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.

A 69-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of hepatic vascular malformations. He had mild anemia with iron deficiency, and dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant arteriovenous and arterioportal shunts throughout the liver. Telangiectasia from the pharynx to the duodenum was confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient history revealed episodes of epistaxis as well as a family history of epistaxis. He was diagnosed with HHT, although no other family member had been diagnosed with definite HHT. A diagnosis of HHT must be considered in patients with hepatic vascular malformations.

"	"A subset of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develops pulmonary hypertension (PH) by mechanisms including pulmonary arterial hypertension, high flow, and elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare clinical condition with abnormal direct communication between the branches of pulmonary artery and vein. It may occur as an isolated anomaly or in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Although these vascular pulmonary pathologies are quite uncommon, they are the important part of the differential diagnosis of common pulmonary problems such as hypoxemia and pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis of PAVM in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.

Approximately 50 % of patients with HHT experience potentially life-threatening health complications such as stroke, brain abscess, or heart failure. However, the most common symptom is spontaneous and frequent nosebleeding. HHT is a hereditary condition with significant health consequences, but little is known about how individuals cope with HHT on a daily basis and how individuals share information about the disorder with social groups outside of the family. The objectives of this study were to improve understanding of the daily experiences of patients with diagnosed HHT and to investigate how they disclose their diagnosis to various social groups (friends, dating partners, employers, and coworkers) outside of their biological family. Adult patients seen at a university HHT clinic and who had been diagnosed with HHT for at least 6 months were recruited by mail. Participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 19). A qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts identified four major categories: (1) the emotional impact of HHT, (2) the social impact of HHT, (3) concerns for current and future health related to HHT, and (4) social context drives disclosure of HHT. Participants reported that although HHT was a manageable hereditary disorder, the symptoms negatively affected their daily life. It is important for health care providers to understand how individuals with rare genetic disorders are managing.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials. 4.

"	"Hepatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However, when present, clinical manifestations can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Current expertise in the variable clinical manifestations and recommendations for diagnostic approach and management of hepatic involvement in HHT are outlined. A review of current literature was performed using the MEDLINE search string: ""Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL] AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL])"". Due to the lack of therapeutic consequence, systematic screening for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic patients with HHT is currently not recommended. In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations. The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

26646071	"Endoglin regulates mural cell adhesion in the circulatory system
"	"The circulatory system is walled off by different cell types, including vascular mural cells and podocytes. The interaction and interplay between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes, play a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is an RGD-containing counter-receptor for β1 integrins and is highly expressed by ECs during angiogenesis. We find that the adhesion between vascular ECs and mural cells is enhanced by integrin activators and inhibited upon suppression of membrane endoglin or β1-integrin, as well as by addition of soluble endoglin (SolEng), anti-integrin α5β1 antibody or an RGD peptide. Analysis of different endoglin mutants, allowed the mapping of the endoglin RGD motif as involved in the adhesion process. In Eng (+/-) mice, a model for hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia type 1, endoglin haploinsufficiency induces a pericyte-dependent increase in vascular permeability. Also, transgenic mice overexpressing SolEng, an animal model for preeclampsia, show podocyturia, suggesting that SolEng is responsible for podocytes detachment from glomerular capillaries. These results suggest a critical role for endoglin in integrin-mediated adhesion of mural cells and provide a better understanding on the mechanisms of vessel maturation in normal physiology as well as in pathologies such as preeclampsia or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"The aim of this study was to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) as a screening test for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This retrospective study included suspected patients with HHT who were screened for PAVM with a TCD and a chest computed tomography (CT) study. The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.

Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04).

Symptoms of HHT can be present in individuals who test negative for mutations in these three genes indicating other genes may be involved. In this study, we tested for mutations in two genes, RASA1 and GDF2, which were recently reported to be involved in vascular disorders. To determine whether RASA1 and GDF2 have phenotypic overlap with HHT and should be included in diagnostic testing, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to detect mutations in 93 unrelated individuals who previously tested negative for mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, but were clinically suspected to have HHT. Pathogenic mutations in RASA1 were identified in two samples (2.15%) and a variant of unknown significance in GDF2 was detected in one sample. All three individuals experienced epistaxis with dermal lesions described in medical records as telangiectases. These results indicate that the inclusion of RASA1 and GDF2 screening in individuals suspected to have HHT will increase the detection rate and aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis.

"	"The incidence of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT - Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) in the Netherlands is 1:5000 but approximately 1:1300 in people from the Antilles. The disease is characterised by the development of telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that may result in serious morbidity and mortality. A 31-year-old primigravid patient consulted her general practitioner at 31 1/7 weeks gestational age with dyspnoea. She was referred for further diagnostics because of suspected pulmonary embolism. A CT scan showed haemothorax and a bleeding arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left lung. Family history suggested the possibility of HHT. After multidisciplinary consideration, a primary caesarean section was performed, followed by embolisation of the AVM during the same surgical session. The patient had a gene mutation consistent with HHT type 2. Pregnant patients with HHT are at risk of serious morbidity, especially if they are not screened for AVMs. A multidisciplinary approach for such patients, with consideration of various scenarios, is highly recommended.

"	"The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations with an absence of capillaries between arteries and veins. One major manifestation site is the nasal mucous membrane where recurrent nosebleeds occur. Our clinical strategy to treat patients with HHT has the aim to reduce nasal bleeding long-term with minimal local and general side effects. We describe staged diagnosis and therapy including individual medical treatments of 97 patients with HHT. The success of treatment is monitored with a systematic questionnaire. The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy remains standard treatment of choice with no major side effects despite the need for repeated treatment. In addition new treatment strategies like nasal occlusion, local drug therapy, and nasal septal splinting show initial success. Improvement of the quality of life of HHT patients can be achieved by a multimodal concept. Several new treatment strategies like nasal septal splinting and nasal occlusion successfully expand the range of established methods. Further studies have to prove the safety and long-term effectiveness of the described individual medical treatments.

"	"Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.

27646277	"Defective fluid shear stress mechanotransduction mediates hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. She denied any symptoms except recurrent epistaxis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. We performed open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.

"	"We present the case of a patient who came to our attention for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Echocardiography showed moderate diastolic overload of both ventricles with enhanced cardiac output without valvular disease or cardiac shunt that could account for this cardiomegaly. A subsequent abdominal echocardiographic exploration showed an angiomatous transformation of the liver due to diffuse lacunar enlargement of hepatic portal vein branches and arterial-venous shunts. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the echocardiographic findings. The imaging findings coupled with cutaneous and nasopharyngeal lesions were suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the diagnosis was confirmed after the identification of a mutation in the ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12. HHT is a rare but underestimated vascular disease that can affect different organs, in particular the liver, leading to organ failure requiring transplantation as occurred in our patient. Echocardiography is a useful imaging tool to exclude cardiac abnormalities as a cause of cardiomegaly and to guide the correct diagnosis of a peripheral origin of high cardiac output.

"	"Endoglin (ENG)/CD105 is an essential endothelial cell co-receptor of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) and involved in tumor angiogenesis and preeclampsia. Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of human ENG and its complex with the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). BMP9 interacts with a hydrophobic surface of the N-terminal orphan domain of ENG, which adopts a new duplicated fold generated by circular permutation. The interface involves residues mutated in HHT1 and overlaps with the epitope of tumor-suppressing anti-ENG monoclonal TRC105. The structure of the C-terminal zona pellucida module suggests how two copies of ENG embrace homodimeric BMP9, whose binding is compatible with ligand recognition by type I but not type II receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the BMP signaling cascade, with implications for future therapeutic interventions in this fundamental pathway.

However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%.

This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs. Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.

However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics RASA1-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. RASA1-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a highly debilitating and life-threatening genetic vascular disorder arising from endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and hypervascularization, for which no cure exists. Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs. Tacrolimus repurposing has therefore therapeutic potential in HHT.

Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family. A combination of clinical and genetic diagnosis could improve the diagnosis and treatment of HHT.

29080903	"Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions
"	"Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, we hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.

The epistaxis severity score (ESS), a validated tool for assessing epistaxis severity, was used to assess epistaxis. Statistical analyses were conducted on the full HHT cohort as well as subgroups stratified by the HHT causative gene (HHT1 = ENG and HHT2 = ACVRL1). Sixty-nine pediatric subjects were identified; 60 had HHT confirmed by genetic testing, and nine (from families with known mutations) met published clinical diagnostic criteria alone. Fifty-nine (85%) had onset of epistaxis. The median age of onset of epistaxis was 5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-9 years). The median ESS for the entire cohort was 1.6 (IQR: 0-2.6).

Epistaxis may present early in HHT, but is typically mild in the pediatric period. Severity in the pediatric population is worse in patients with HHT1. By recognizing the significance of even mild, infrequent epistaxis in a child with a family history of HHT, and understanding that not all HHT patients have epistaxis during childhood, community providers and otolaryngologist can assist in the early detection of HHT. 4 Laryngoscope, 128:1714-1719, 2018.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4. Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels due to mutations in specific genes that lead to angiogenesis errors. HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.

Patients treated for HHT-associated epistaxis by intranasal submucosal bevacizumab injections between June 2011 and August 2013 were included and followed prospectively. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by the epistaxis severity score (ESS); the epistaxis intensity, frequency, and the need of blood transfusion (IFT) score; and hemoglobin levels. Thirty-three patients were included. The total number of treatments with intranasal bevacizumab injection was 210. The mean number of treatments per patient was 6.2 ± 4.6 (range, 1-16), and the mean treatment and observation period was 38.8 ± 21.8 months (range, 2-66 months). Four patients showed no improvement after treatment. Eleven patients (33.3%) showed initial improvement in both ESS and IFT, but the treatment was discontinued before the end of the study because the effect became gradually shorter lasting despite repeated injections. Twelve patients (36.3%) continued to have a positive response to the treatment at the end of the study. No local adverse effects were observed, but one patient developed osteonecrosis in both knees during the treatment period. Intranasal bevacizumab injection is an effective treatment for most of the moderate and severe grades of HHT-associated epistaxis. The duration of the effect of the treatment was variable. Primary and late resistance phenomena to the treatment were quite common. 4. Laryngoscope, 128:2237-2244, 2018.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and multisystem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2). This robust patient cohort of brain AVMs in 39 patients with HHT advances the collective understanding of this disease's varied presentation, diagnostic workup, genetic underpinnings, and available treatment options.

"	"Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is an important risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. Current treatments for bAVM are all associated with considerable risks. There is no safe method to prevent bAVM hemorrhage. Thalidomide reduces nose bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an inherited disorder characterized by vascular malformations. In this study, we tested whether thalidomide and its less toxic analog, lenalidomide, reduce bAVM hemorrhage using a mouse model. bAVMs were induced through induction of brain focal activin-like kinase 1 (Alk1, an AVM causative gene) gene deletion and angiogenesis in adult Alk1-floxed mice. Thalidomide was injected intraperitoneally twice per week for 6 weeks, starting either 2 or 8 weeks after AVM induction. Lenalidomide was injected intraperitoneally daily starting 8 weeks after AVM induction for 6 weeks. Brain samples were collected at the end of the treatments for morphology, mRNA, and protein analyses. The influence of Alk1 downregulation on PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor B) expression was also studied on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells. The effect of PDGFB in mural cell recruitment in bAVM was explored by injection of a PDGFB overexpressing lentiviral vector to the mouse brain. Thalidomide or lenalidomide treatment reduced the number of dysplastic vessels and hemorrhage and increased mural cell (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) coverage in the bAVM lesion. Thalidomide reduced the burden of CD68+ cells and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the bAVM lesions. PDGFB expression was reduced in ALK1-knockdown human brain microvascular endothelial cells and in mouse bAVM lesion. Thalidomide increased Pdgfb expression in bAVM lesion. Overexpression of PDGFB mimicked the effect of thalidomide. Thalidomide and lenalidomide improve mural cell coverage of bAVM vessels and reduce bAVM hemorrhage, which is likely through upregulation of Pdgfb expression.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to obtain data on all hospital discharges occurring in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012. The association between admission age and HHT-related complications and outcomes were studied. 10293 hospitalizations in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012 were included. Patients > 50 accounted for 77% of all admissions with 30% of admissions occurring in the 51-65 age group. Bleeding related complications were the most frequent (62.7%,n= 6455 hospitalizations), followed by cardiovascular (41%,n= 4216), neurological (12.4%,n= 1276), and hepatobiliary (6.4%,n= 660) complications. Patients older than 50 accounted for 83% of bleeding events, 90% of cardiovascular events, 58% of neurologic events, and 81% of hepatobiliary events. The vast majority (83%) of medical and surgical procedures were performed in those older than 50 years of age. Older patients also experienced higher rates of death. Aging has significant adverse impacts on rates of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes amongst HHT patients in the United States. Except for neurologic complications, the vast majority of this disease burden is borne by patients older than 50 years.

This was a retrospective, multicenter chart review of 673 patients evaluated between 2002 and 2016; 290 were eligible for the study. Genetic testing for a pathogenic mutation was considered the gold standard against which the clinical Curaçao criteria were compared. Patients were divided into 4 age categories: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-21-years. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each age group, and for the overall population. Overall the Curaçao criteria had a sensitivity of 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 91%-100%). Sensitivity was lowest in the 0- to 5-year group, and increased with advancing age. The Curaçao criteria had the highest sensitivity in the 16- to 21-year-olds. Specificity was 100% in all age groups except for the 11- to 15-year-olds. This study evaluated the use of the Curaçao criteria for the diagnosis of HHT in the pediatric population with a family history of HHT. In those between the age of 0 and 21 years who meet 1 criterion (unlikely HHT) or 2 criteria (possible HHT), genetic testing is preferred for diagnosis. The Curaçao criteria appear to reliably diagnose HHT in children and adolescents who meet 3 or 4 criteria (definite HHT).

Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as epistaxis. Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH. Recently, it was shown that tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.

"	"The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.

In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic vascular disease with a wordwide prevalence of 1:5000-1:10000. We introduce our algorithm for the stratified population screening of HHT. Probands are selected from the consecutive hospital database review for HHT (I7800) and recurrent epistaxis (R0400) and the review of patient records referred by family practicioners. A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

"	"Background and study aims  Small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) pose a bleeding risk and have traditionally been diagnosed by invasive enteroscopic procedures in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Capsule endoscopy (CE) is emerging as a safe and non-invasive alternative for small intestinal evaluation, but its diagnostic yield and utility in diagnosing small bowel AVMs in HHT patients are understudied. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the utility of CE for diagnosing AVMs in HHT patients. Methods  A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature on CE in HHT patients identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2018 were conducted. Summary effects were estimated using a random effects model. Results  After applying exclusion criteria, five studies (n = 124 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic yield for visualization of small bowel AVMs by CE was 77.0 % (95 % CI 65.8 - 85.4 %, P  < 0.001). Conclusions  CE has a good diagnostic yield for small bowel AVMs in HHT. It can be regarded as a sufficient, noninvasive diagnostic modality for identifying small bowel AVMs in HHT patients.

30717761	"Safety of thalidomide and bevacizumab in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular dysplasia that leads to nosebleeds and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Anti-angiogenic drugs thalidomide and bevacizumab have been increasingly used off-label with variable results. The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs) classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001). Thalidomide AEs occurred at more similar rates in males (25 AEs in 41 men, 60.9%) and females (12 in 26 (46.2%), but were more common in ENG patients (17 in 17) than in ACVRL1 (14 in 34, p < 0.0001). For bevacizumab, the most common reports were of joint pains (7/69, 10%), headache (3/69, 4.4%) and proteinuria (2/69, 3%), and for thalidomide, peripheral neuropathy (12/67, 18%); drowsiness (8/67, 12%); and dizziness (6/67, 9%). Fatal adverse events were more common in males (p = 0.009), and in patients with ENG pathogenic variants (p = 0.012). One fatal AE was possibly related to bevacizumab (average incidence rate: 1.5 per 100 person-years); 3 fatal AEs were possibly related to thalidomide (average incidence rate: 4 per 100 person-years). With potential increase in use of Bevacizumab and Thalidomide in HHT patients, data presented support appropriate weighing of the toxicities which can arise in HHT settings and the practice recommendations for their prevention and management.

30744395	"Angiopoietin-2 Inhibition Rescues Arteriovenous Malformation in a Smad4 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Mouse Model
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in 4 transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway members, including the central transcriptional mediator of the TGFβ pathway, Smad4. Loss of Smad4 causes the formation of inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can hemorrhage leading to stroke, aneurysm, or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and the TGFβ downstream effectors responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated AVM formation are currently unknown. To identify potential biological targets of the TGFβ pathway involved in AVM formation, we performed RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments on BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9)-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and isolated ECs from a Smad4-inducible, EC-specific knockout ( Smad4-iECKO) mouse model that develops retinal AVMs. These sequencing studies identified the angiopoietin-Tek signaling pathway as a downstream target of SMAD4. We used monoclonal blocking antibodies to target a specific component in this pathway and assess its effects on AVM development. Sequencing studies uncovered 212 potential biological targets involved in AVM formation, including the EC surface receptor, TEK (TEK receptor tyrosine kinase) and its antagonistic ligand, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2). In Smad4-iECKO mice, Angpt2 expression is robustly increased, whereas Tek levels are decreased, resulting in an overall reduction in angiopoietin-Tek signaling. We provide evidence that SMAD4 directly represses Angpt2 transcription in ECs. Inhibition of ANGPT2 function in Smad4-deficient mice, either before or after AVMs form, prevents and alleviates AVM formation and normalizes vessel diameters. These rescue effects are attributed to a reversion in EC morphological changes, such as cell size and shape that are altered in the absence of Smad4. Our studies provide a novel mechanism whereby the loss of Smad4 causes increased Angpt2 transcription in ECs leading to AVM formation, increased blood vessel calibers, and changes in EC morphology in the retina. Blockade of ANGPT2 function in an in vivo Smad4 model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia alleviated these vascular phenotypes, further implicating ANGPT2 as an important TGFβ downstream mediator of AVM formation. Therefore, alternative approaches that target ANGPT2 function may have therapeutic value for the alleviation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms, such as AVMs.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF), a vessel malformation connecting the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation while bypassing the pulmonary capillaries, can cause paradoxical cerebral infarction. It is often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic disease characterized by multiple dermal, mucosal, and visceral telangiectasia causing recurrent bleeding. Paradoxical cerebral embolism caused by PAVF without HHT is rare. Here, we report a patient with isolated PAVF who experienced an ischemic stroke caused by a paradoxical embolism from deep venous thrombosis; the patient was successfully treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. She presented with a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation to 91%, and lung disease was suspected. A PAVF was subsequently found in the right S6 region using contrast computed tomography. Interventional radiologists successfully occluded the shunt using 6 microcoils. PAVF should be considered when determining the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in patients with hypoxia, which can be the only symptom of PAVF.

"	"To assess pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) growth among patients with untreated PAVMs using imaging from long-term follow-up per hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia international guidelines. Analysis included 88 untreated PAVMs from 21 patients (6 male;15 female; mean age at presentation 47 y; range, 12-68 y). Two CT studies with the longest interval between were evaluated (mean 8.4 y; median 8.8 y; range, 3.1-14.1 y). Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up. Model-based mean analysis showed no statistically significant change in dimension of any variable between earliest and follow-up imaging. Secondary analysis including age also found no statistically significant difference (feeding diameter, P = .09; AP sac dimension, P = .9; ML sac dimension, P = .1). Analysis including time between measurements found no significant relationship between change in variables and time (feeding artery diameter, P = .4; AP sac dimension, P = .3; ML sac dimension, P = .06). Untreated PAVMs grew slowly, if at all, in a near-decade span, and any demonstrated growth was minimal. These findings challenge the current recommendation of 3- to 5-year CT follow-up.

31400083	"Variant analysis in Chinese families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Recurrent epistaxis is the primary complaint in 90%-96% of HHT patients and the other symptoms come with age. The aim of this study was to analyze HHT-associated gene variant spectrum in Chinese HHT patients and to assess whether genetic testing could contribute to the early diagnosis. Thirty one HHT families including 62 individuals were recruited. Variants in the coding regions of four genes involved in HHT were amplified and analyzed using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twenty unique variants, including 8 novel variants were found in 24 of the 31 (77.4%) kindred. Diagnosis is confirmed for 7 possible individuals from 6 kindred. Thirteen ACVRL1 variants were detected from 17 isolated HHT families. Variants in ACVRL1 from 8/17 (47.1%) families were located in exon8. Seven ENG variants were found in 7 unrelated families throughout the coding region. We conclude that ACVRL1 gene variant is 2.4 times more prevalent than that in ENG in Chinese individuals with HHT, and exon8 of the ACVRL1 gene may be a hotspot region. Genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis for HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31540324	"Endoglin Protein Interactome Profiling Identifies TRIM21 and Galectin-3 as New Binding Partners
"	"Endoglin is a 180-kDa glycoprotein receptor primarily expressed by the vascular endothelium and involved in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene (ENG) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, a vascular disease that presents with nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. A circulating form of endoglin (alias soluble endoglin, sEng), proteolytically released from the membrane-bound protein, has been observed in several inflammation-related pathological conditions and appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cancer development through unknown mechanisms. Membrane-bound endoglin is an auxiliary component of the TGF-β receptor complex and the extracellular region of endoglin has been shown to interact with types I and II TGF-β receptors, as well as with BMP9 and BMP10 ligands, both members of the TGF-β family. To search for novel protein interactors, we screened a microarray containing over 9000 unique human proteins using recombinant sEng as bait. We find that sEng binds with high affinity, at least, to 22 new proteins. Among these, we validated the interaction of endoglin with galectin-3, a secreted member of the lectin family with capacity to bind membrane glycoproteins, and with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Using human endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that endoglin co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with galectin-3 or TRIM21. These results open new research avenues on endoglin function and regulation.

Retrospective analytic chart review. We performed a chart review that included all patients with HHT treated with intranasal bevacizumab and cyanoacrylate glue for refractory epistaxis at Lariboisiere University Hospital from 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. We injected 100 mg (25 mg/mL) of bevacizumab diluted in 2 mL of serum at the base of the telangiectasias, and sclerotherapy with an injection of cyanoacrylate glue was used adjunctively. Treatment efficacy was based on changes in Epistaxis Severity Scores (ESS) and the Bergler-Sadick Scale. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder (CL) and Likert scale, respectively. Thirty-one patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 26.6 months. The average ESS score significantly decreased from 7.82 to 3.89 (P < .05). The Bergler-Sadick score significantly improved (P < .05) following the treatment, including the frequency (from 2.74 to 1.64) and the quantity (from 2.54 to 1.51) scales. Quality of life was significantly improved (P < .05) using the CL score (from 4.16 to 7.22). The Likert satisfaction scale related to the treatment efficacy was high, with an average of 7.03 out of 10. No complications were noted. Submucosal injections of bevacizumab in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy significantly reduced epistaxis and improved the quality of life in HHT. Prospective comparative studies are needed to further evaluate the significance of this treatment modality. 3b Laryngoscope, 129:2210-2215, 2019.

"	"Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting more than 98% of adults with HHT, with significant impact on quality of life. Floseal® has been shown to be effective for the management of anterior epistaxis, but has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in this population. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Floseal® for managing acute anterior epistaxis in patients with HHT. A pilot prospective clinical trial was conducted at two tertiary referral centres, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada and The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. All patients with HHT presenting with acute anterior epistaxis to the two study centres, who enrolled in the study, received Floseal® treatment. The primary outcome measures were achievement of hemostasis and changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) between baseline and one-month follow up. Secondary outcome measure included clinical assessment of the nasal cavity. Seven patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent treatment of anterior epistaxis with Floseal® and achieved control of epistaxis within 15-min post-application. Application of Floseal® was well tolerated, with patients reporting a pain score of 3 ± 3.13 out of 10. There was no statistically significant difference noted in ESS scores pre-treatment and one-month follow up, 6.27 ± 2.42 vs. 4.50 ± 2.44, p = 0.179. There was a significant improvement clinically on exam of the nasal cavity between baseline and at one-month follow up, indicated by a decrease in the clinical assessment score, 17.29 ± 7.70 vs. 9.57 ± 7.81 (p = 0.0088). Patients with HHT presenting with acute epistaxis were able to achieve hemostasis with one application of Floseal®, with the procedure being very well tolerated with minimal pain. Although there was no significant change in ESS scores, clinical assessment of the nasal cavity revealed significant improvement at one-month follow up post treatment with Floseal®. This multi-centered prospective clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02638012 ). Registered on December 22, 2015.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.

Endoscopic tests were performed when there was suspicion of GI bleeding, and patients were divided as follows: with, without, and with unsuspected GI involvement. 67 (27.9%) patients with, 28 (11.7%) patients without, and 145 (60.4%) with unsuspected GI involvement were included. Age, tobacco use, endoglin (ENG) mutation, and hemoglobin were associated with GI involvement. Telangiectases were mostly in the stomach and duodenum, but 18.5% of patients with normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) had GI involvement in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Telangiectases ≤ 3 mm and ≤10 per location were most common. Among patients with GI disease, those with hemoglobin < 8 g/dL or transfusion requirements (65.7%) were older and had higher epistaxis severity score (ESS) and larger telangiectases (>3 mm). After a mean follow-up of 34.2 months, patients with GI involvement required more transfusions and more emergency department and hospital admissions, with no differences in mortality. Risk factors for GI involvement have been identified. Patients with GI involvement and severe anemia had larger telangiectases and higher ESS.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

A randomized controlled trial was performed randomizing individual PAVMs to treatment with IDC versus Nester coils at the largest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center in Canada. The primary outcome was CT evidence of reperfusion at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural complications, fluoroscopy time and contrast volume. Our study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and subsequent expiration of funding. A total of 46 PAVMs in 25 patients (64% female) were included in our study; 26 randomized to Nester coils and 20 randomized to IDC. One patient was lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 421.2 ± 215.7 days, no significant difference in PAVM reperfusion was detected between Nester coils and IDC (0% vs. 5.6%, p > 0.05). No major periprocedural complications were noted in either group. Fluoroscopy time (Nester: 15.0 ± 11.8 min vs. IDC 16.0 ± 5.4 min, p > 0.05) and contrast volume (Nester: 80.3 ± 36.5 ml vs. IDC 87.3 ± 51.7 ml, p > 0.05) utilized did not differ between groups. No significant difference was detected in PAVM reperfusion rates, periprocedural complication rates, contrast volume utilization or fluoroscopy time following embolization with IDC and Nester coils.

"	"Impaired ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1)/Endoglin/BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) signaling predisposes to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activation of SMAD1/5 signaling can be enhanced by shear stress. In the genetic disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is characterized by arteriovenous malformations, the affected receptors are those involved in the activation of mechanosensitive SMAD1/5 signaling. To elucidate how genetic and mechanical signals interact in AVM development, we sought to identify targets differentially regulated by BMP9 and shear stress. Approach and Results: We identify Cx37 (Connexin37) as a differentially regulated target of ligand-induced and mechanotransduced SMAD1/5 signaling. We show that stimulation of endothelial cells with BMP9 upregulated Cx37, whereas shear stress inhibited this expression. This signaling was SMAD1/5-dependent, and in the absence of SMAD1/5, there was an inversion of the expression pattern. Ablated SMAD1/5 signaling alone caused AVM-like vascular malformations directly connecting the dorsal aorta to the inlet of the heart. In yolk sacs of mouse embryos with an endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5, addition of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), which downregulates Cx37, induced development of these direct connections bypassing the yolk sac capillary bed. In wild-type embryos undergoing vascular remodeling, Cx37 was globally expressed by endothelial cells but was absent in regions of enlarging vessels. TNFα and endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5 caused ectopic regions lacking Cx37 expression, which correlated to areas of vascular malformations. Mechanistically, loss of Cx37 impairs correct directional migration under flow conditions. Our data demonstrate that Cx37 expression is differentially regulated by shear stress and SMAD1/5 signaling, and that reduced Cx37 expression is permissive for capillary enlargement into shunts.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral vascular malformations. Individuals suffering from HHT have a significantly increased risk of bacterial infections, but the mechanisms involved in this are not clear. White blood cell subpopulations were estimated with flow cytometry in 79 patients with HHT and 45 healthy individuals, and association with clinicopathological status was assessed. A prominent decrease in absolute numbers of T cells in HHT was revealed (0.7 (0.5-1.1) vs. 1.3 (0.8-1.6), 106/mL, p < 0.05), and in multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin level was associated with lymphopenia (OR = 0.625, 95% CI: 0.417-0.937, p < 0.05). Although no changes in absolute numbers of neutrophils and monocytes were observed, we revealed a significant impairment of neutrophil antibacterial functions in HHT (n = 9), compared to healthy individuals (n = 7), in vitro. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MOI10 was significantly suppressed in HHT (mean area per cell, mm2: 76 (70-92) vs. 121 (97-128), p < 0.05), due to impaired filamentous actin organization (% of positive cells: 69 (59-77) vs. 92 (88-94), p < 0.05). To conclude, this study reveals the categories of patients with HHT that are prone to immunosuppression and require careful monitoring, and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy based on the functional activation of neutrophils.

"	"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.

"	"Objective: To explore the value of right heart contrast echocardiography in etiological diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 patients who underwent transthoracic contrast echocardiography in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from May 2015 to July 2018, all of whom were diagnosed as PH by right heart catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups according to contrast echocardiography: the intra-cardiac shunt group (<4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); Intrapulmonary shunt group (>4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); non-shunt group. The etiology, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PO(2)), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central nervous system complications were also compared among the three groups. Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.

"	"Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.

32573726	"Mutational and phenotypic characterization of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Care delivery for HHT patients is impeded by the need for laborious, repeated phenotyping and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between causal DNA variants in ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4 and GDF2, and clinical manifestations. To address this, we analyzed DNA samples from 183 previously uncharacterized, unrelated HHT and suspected HHT cases using the ThromboGenomics high-throughput sequencing platform. We identified 127 rare variants across 168 heterozygous genotypes. Applying modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines, 106 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 21 as nonpathogenic (variant of uncertain significance/benign). Unlike the protein products of ACVRL1 and SMAD4, the extracellular ENG amino acids are not strongly conserved. Our inferences of the functional consequences of causal variants in ENG were therefore informed by the crystal structure of endoglin. We then compared the accuracy of predictions of the causal gene blinded to the genetic data using 2 approaches: subjective clinical predictions and statistical predictions based on 8 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Both approaches had some predictive power, but they were insufficiently accurate to be used clinically, without genetic testing. The distributions of red cell indices differed by causal gene but not sufficiently for clinical use in isolation from genetic data. We conclude that parallel sequencing of the 4 known HHT genes, multidisciplinary team review of variant calls in the context of detailed clinical information, and statistical and structural modeling improve the prognostication and treatment of HHT.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

32762495	"Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.

MNCs of HHT patients and normal controls were subjected to migration assay. Fractions of MNCs were pre-incubated with antibodies specific to HHT causative genes ENG [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1)] or activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2)], AMD3100 or Diprotin-A to block ENG, ALK1 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) or CD26 (increased in HHT1 MNCs) before migration assay. The MNCs were allowed to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 18 h. The expression of CXCR4, CD26, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) in MNCs and nitric oxide levels in the plasma were analyzed. Compared to the controls, fewer HHT1 MNCs and similar number of HHT2 MNCs migrated toward SDF-1α. Diprotin-A pre-treatment improved HHT1 MNC-migration, but had no effect on normal and HHT2 MNCs. Pre-incubation with an anti-ENG antibody reduced the migration of normal MNCs. Diprotin-A did not improve the migration of ENG antibody pre-treated MNCs. Anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on MNC-migration. AMD3100 treatment reduced normal and HHT MNC-migration. ENG mRNA level was reduced in HHT1 and HHT2 MNCs. ALK1 mRNA was reduced in HHT2 MNCs only. CD26 expression was higher in HHT1 MNCs. Pre-treatment of MNCs with anti-ENG or anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on CD26 and CXCR4 expression. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, SOD1, was reduced in HHT1 MNCs, which was accompanied with an increase of ROS in HHT MNCs and nitric oxide in HHT1 plasma. Reduction of ENG receptor on MNC surface reduced monocyte migration toward SDF-1α independent of CD26 expression. Increased oxidative stress could alter HHT MNC migration behavior.

Twenty participants with moderate-severe HHT-related epistaxis were randomized to eight weeks of propranolol gel 1.5%, or placebo 0.5 cc, applied to each nostril twice daily; and continued propranolol for eight weeks in an open-label study. For the propranolol group, the epistaxis severity score (ESS) improved significantly (-2.03 ± 1.7 as compared with -0.35 ± 0.68 for the placebo group, p = 0.009); hemoglobin levels improved significantly (10.5 ± 2.6 to 11.4 ± 2.02 g/dL, p = 0.009); and intravenous iron and blood transfusion requirement decreased. The change in nasal endoscopy findings was not significant. During the open-label period, the ESS score improved significantly in the former placebo group (-1.99 ± 1.41, p = 0.005). The most common adverse event was nasal mucosa burning sensation. No cardiovascular events were reported. Our results suggest that topical propranolol gel is safe and effective in HHT-related epistaxis.

"	"Epistaxis is the greatest cause of morbidity in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); because of this, a validated epistaxis-specific quality-of-life instrument for HHT should be made available. To develop and validate an epistaxis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure for HHT. This survey study focused on the development and validation of the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis (NOSE) in HTT (NOSE HHT) outcome measure with data prospectively collected from December 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. A total of 401 patients were recruited from within the Cure Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia online patient advocacy social media network, the Washington University HHT Center of Excellence, and a randomized clinical trial investigating an intranasal timolol gel for HHT-associated epistaxis. Face and content validity, factor analysis, internal consistency as measured through Cronbach α, construct validity, responsiveness to change, and minimal clinically important difference. The NOSE HHT was developed and validated with a possible score ranging discretely from 0 to 4 for each of the 29 items and a total score ranging continuously from 0 to 4 after dividing by the total number of items answered. A total of 401 participants completed the NOSE HHT. Factor analysis identified 3 factors that matched the a priori specified subgroups of particular aspects of life affected by HHT-associated epistaxis: physical problems (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.59 [0.83]), functional limitations (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.28 [0.84]), and emotional consequences (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.95 [1.02]). The instrument had high internal consistency with an overall Cronbach α of 0.960. Convergent validity determined the total NOSE HHT score to be a strong predictor of disease severity; total NOSE HHT score can be split up into the following epistaxis severity categories: mild (0-1), moderate (1.01-2), and severe (>2). The instrument was found to be sensitive to change, and the minimal clinically important difference for the total NOSE HHT score was 0.46. Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

This rare disease can involve one or more organs and clinical manifestations interest several medical specialties. A review of recent literature and our clinical experience shows that COVID-19 pandemic greatly influences the autonomy and psychic sphere of patients with HHT, causing them further distress. Often patients affected by HHT experience a sense of loneliness due to the rarity of this pathology and COVID-19 pandemic adds a burden for them and their caregivers who have to face emotional experiences that interfere with personal, social and working functioning. Multidisciplinary approach and web-mediated counseling intervention could offer a valid and personalized support for patients affected by HHT and their caregivers during quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy may be underdiagnosed as it is often mistaken for disorders that are morphologically very similar, including generalized essential telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis. The diagnosis of CCV is made histologically and findings feature dilated superficial dermal vessels with thickened walls containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive eosinophilic hyaline material. Effective treatment options for CCV have yet to be established and given its benign disease course, treatment may not be necessary. Pulsed dye laser can be offered to patients for cosmetic improvement but the extent of the disease makes complete lesion clearance challenging in most cases.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Untreated AVMs, especially in the lungs-pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)-can result in morbidity with a decreased life expectancy. We have investigated whether HHT patients, systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed, have a similar survival as persons without HHT. We included all individuals screened for HHT between 2004 and 2016 with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis (HHT group) or excluded diagnosis (non-HHT control group). The social security number was used to confirm status as dead or alive in December 2019. We included 717 HHT patients and 471 controls. There was no difference in survival between the HHT and the non-HHT control group. The HHT group had a life expectancy of 75.9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.3-78.6), comparable to the control group (79.3 years, 95% CI 74.8-84.0, Mantel-Cox test: p = 0.29). In conclusion, the life expectancy of HHT patients systematically screened for HHT-related organ involvement and treated if needed in an HHT center of excellence was similar compared to their controls, justifying systematic screening and treatment in HHT patients.

"	"The inhibiting effects of itraconazole, an antifungal drug on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have recently been discovered. By inhibiting VEGF, itraconazole has shown potential in clinical trials as anti-cancer treatment. In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients, VEGF levels are elevated and inhibition of VEGF can decrease bleeding. Itraconazole could potentially serve as anti-angiogenic therapy for HHT-related bleeding. We report a proof of concept study with HHT patients and severe epistaxis. Patients were treated with daily 200 mg orally administered itraconazole for sixteen weeks. Twenty-one HHT patients, 8 females (38%), 13 males (62%), median age of 59 years (interquartile range (IQR) 55-69) were enrolled. Of these patients, 13 (62%) were diagnosed with HHT type 1, seven (33%) with HHT type 2 and in one patient (5%), no pathognomonic HHT mutation was found. Four patients (19%) prematurely terminated the study (3 due to mild or moderate side-effects) resulting in 17 patients included in the analyses. The median epistaxis severity score significantly decreased during treatment from 6.0 (IQR 5.1-7.2) to 3.8 (IQR 3.1-5.2) (p = 0.006). The monthly epistaxis frequency decreased from 56 to 38 epistaxis episodes (p = 0.004) and the monthly duration from 407 to 278 minutes (p = 0.005). Hemoglobin levels did not significantly change. The quality of life showed a small but significant improvement. In conclusion, oral itraconazole significantly improved epistaxis in HHT patients. The potential benefit of itraconazole in HHT should be further investigated.

"	"This report addresses how patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and high output cardiac failure (HOCF) due to hepatic vascular malformations, should be evaluated and could be treated. HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

"	"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of rufinamide relative to topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a three-year time horizon in patients with LGS uncontrolled by up to three antiepileptic drugs. Utilities were assigned to health states, defined according to a patient's response to treatment (> or =75%, > or =50% and <75%, and <50% reduction in tonic-atonic [drop attack] seizure frequency and death). Efficacy and safety estimates were made using indirect/mixed-treatment comparisons of data obtained from published literature. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), allowing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be estimated as cost per QALY gained. Over three years, the total cumulative costs for rufinamide, topiramate, and lamotrigine were pound24,992, pound23,360, and pound21,783, respectively. Rufinamide resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.079 relative to topiramate and 0.021 relative to lamotrigine. The incremental costs of rufinamide were pound1632 and pound3209, relative to topiramate and lamotrigine, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound20,538 and pound154,831, respectively. Considering the underlying assumptions, this current economic evaluation demonstrates that rufinamide is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate as adjunctive treatment for children with LGS in the UK. In addition, when compared to lamotrigine, which is an inexpensive treatment, rufinamide should be considered as a cost-effective alternative due to the importance of patient choice and equity of access in such a rare and devastating condition.

On high-resolution MRI, cerebral lesions were noted in 23 (85.2%) patients but not in 4 (14.8%) patients. The age of patients at the time of surgery was between 1.7 and 17.3 years (mean: 7.8 years). Surgeries were lobar or multilobar resection in 21 (77.8%) patients and hemispherotomy in 6 (22.2%). At a mean of 33.1 months' postoperative follow-up, 16 (59.3%) patients had no seizures and 4 (14.8%) had infrequent seizures. Of 4 patients without brain abnormalities found on MRI, 2 patients became seizure-free after resective surgery was performed on the basis of electrophysiologic studies and concordant results in other multimodal neuroimages.

"	"Rufinamide was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) as adjunctive therapy in patients aged 4 years and older. Rufinamide pharmacokinetics (PK) has been established on pooled data from several clinical studies in epilepsy, including one in LGS patients. Demographic covariates and drug-drug interactions with several antiepileptic drugs have been explored using population PK modelling. Two types of drug-drug interactions models were developed and compared. The PK analysis demonstrated that the coadministration of valproate decreases rufinamide clearance, requiring potential dose adjustment. To explore rufinamide exposure under different dosing regimens in LGS patients, clinical trial simulations were performed. The objective of the simulations was to select the doses giving an exposure shown to be safe and efficacious in larger populations. The concentrations simulated in a subgroup of patients with body weight less than 30 kg presented a larger inter-individual variability than in other patients. Additional simulations demonstrated that this increased variability was due partly to greater valproate concentrations in some of the children treated with rufinamide. Simulations of the rufinamide exposure under different maximum daily dose in presence and in absence of valproate co-administration were used to establish the dosing recommendation. The simulations support the proposal of a lower maximum daily rufinamide dose for patients under 30 kg receiving both drugs: the dose of 600 mg/day was proposed as a maximum daily dose in children also receiving valproate concomitantly, whereas in absence of valproate, the maximum daily dose is 1000 mg/day.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic childhood form of epilepsy. The syndrome is characterized by mental impairment, frequent seizures of multiple types that are particularly resistant to treatment, and high rates of seizure-related injury. With the introduction of newer, but more costly, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is important that decision makers are able to assess their value in the management of this rare and difficult-to-treat condition. To evaluate the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of rufinamide in patients with LGS. An individual patient-simulation model was developed to estimate the total treatment-related costs and clinical benefits of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine over a 3-year time horizon. The model examines the treatment scenarios of adding rufinamide, lamotrigine or topiramate to older AEDs (standard therapy), or standard therapy alone within a primary-care or community setting. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials of adjunctive AED treatment for children with LGS were analysed. There are no head-to-head comparator studies. Between 98 and 139 patients were randomized in each study and the mean age in each study was 10, 11 and 14 years. A mixed-treatment comparison using a random-effects model was carried out on the number of patients in each response category, using the placebo arms of the respective trials. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of successfully treated patients, defined as >50% reduction in the frequency of total seizures and drop attacks. The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. Costs ( pound, year 2006/07 values) of patient monitoring, switching treatments, hospitalization due to seizure, treatment of adverse effects, and personal and social services were included in the analysis. Results of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were bootstrapped to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Over 3 years, adjunctive rufinamide resulted in higher total costs than topiramate and lamotrigine; however, with more patients being treated successfully, this leads to acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. If society is prepared to pay at least 250 pounds for a 1% increase in the number of successfully treated LGS patients, in terms of a 50% reduction in the frequency of drop attacks, the probability of the treatment with rufinamide being cost effective is >80%. This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that rufinamide results in more LGS patients being treated successfully at a reasonable cost from a UK NHS perspective.

Responders were defined as patients who achieved a 50% or greater decrease in countable seizures within 18 months of initiating RUF therapy. Mean overall duration of RUF treatment was 14.5 months (range: 3-18 months). Retention rate, defined as the percentage of patients still taking RUF after 18 months, was 41.7% (n=25/60). The overall response rate after 18 months was 26.7% (16/60 patients). The highest response rates were found in the subgroup of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS, 35.5%) and in patients with other generalized epilepsy syndromes. Complete seizure control was maintained in one patient (1.6%). A total of 73 adverse events were reported in 37 of 60 patients. The most frequently occurring adverse events were fatigue (18.3%), vomiting (15.0%), and loss of appetite (10.0%). Only 4 new adverse events were reported after week 12. No serious adverse events were observed. The present data suggest that RUF is efficacious and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of children and adults with various epilepsy syndromes and difficult-to-control seizures.

"	"Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy and is frequently associated with brain malformations, such as hemimegalencephaly. Recently, longer expansion of the first polyalanine tract of ARX was found to be causative for Ohtahara syndrome without brain malformation, whereas premature termination mutations of ARX were found to cause severe brain malformations, such as lissencephaly or hydranencephaly. Both are designated as ARX-related interneuronopathies. We investigated the molecular basis of Ohtahara syndrome in two families, comprising six male patients in two generations demonstrating X-linked inheritance. Novel frameshift mutations in the terminal exon of the ARX gene (Ala524fsX534 and E536fsX672) were identified in two patients (2 and 13 years, each) from both families. Two patients developed West syndrome, and one of these later developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all patients showed no brain malformations in contrast to the patients with a premature termination mutation in other exons of ARX. The etiology of Ohtahara syndrome is heterogeneous; however, the molecular analysis of ARX should be considered in sporadic or familial male patients with Ohtahara syndrome.

"	"Seizure disorders of the rolandic region comprise a spectrum of different epilepsy syndromes ranging from benign rolandic epilepsy to more severe seizure disorders including atypical benign partial epilepsy/pseudo-Lennox syndrome,electrical status epilepticus during sleep, and Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Centrotemporal spikes are the unifying electroencephalographic hallmark of these benign focal epilepsies, indicating a pathophysiologic relationship between the various epilepsies arising from the rolandic region. The etiology of these epilepsies is elusive, but a genetic component is assumed given the heritability of the characteristic electrographic trait. Herein we report on three patients with intellectual disability, various dysmorphic features, and epilepsies involving the rolandic region, carrying previously undescribed deletions in 16p13. The only gene located in the critical region shared by all three patients is GRIN2A coding for the alpha-2 subunit of the neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor.

"	"The antiepileptic drug felbamate has demonstrated efficacy against a variety of seizure types in the pediatric population, particularly seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Postmarketing experience, however, revealed serious idiosyncratic adverse effects not observed during clinical trials, including aplastic anemia and liver failure. As a result, many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe felbamate. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of felbamate in a pediatric population with intractable epilepsy. Of 38 patients, 22 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (58%); 6 had myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose (16%); 5 had symptomatic generalized epilepsy, not otherwise specified (13%); and 5 had symptomatic localization-related epilepsy (13%). Most patients had multiple seizure types and had been tried on a variety of antiepileptic medications. With felbamate treatment, 6 patients (16%) became seizure free, including 4 of the 6 patients with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy of Doose; 24 patients (63%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. In this population felbamate appeared to be safe, with minimal adverse effects. The study is limited by the small number of patients and by its retrospective nature, but nonetheless adds to the evidence that felbamate is an important antiepileptic drug for medically refractory epilepsy in children and is well tolerated with few adverse effects.

Data from children who were treated between 1999 and 2008 and had continuous follow-up of at least 6 months after initiation of the KD were analysed retrospectively. Response was defined as > or = 50% seizure reduction. Treatment effects on EEG, developmental outcome and the ""outcome-predictive"" value of various clinical factors were also assessed. 50 children (22 boys; mean age 4.5 years+/-3.55) were included. Mean follow-up was 3.93+/-2.95. 50% of the patients were responders, 48% of them became seizure free. 50% were non-responders, 20% of them deteriorated. In responders, EEG background activity improved significantly (p=0.014) and a significantly lower rate of epileptic discharges (p=0.009) was seen after 6 months. In addition, neurological examination findings demonstrated significant developmental progress (p=0.038). Favourable treatment outcome was associated with a shorter disease duration (p=0.025) and generalised tonic clonic seizures (p=0.059). No further significant outcome predictors were detected. However, response was 44% in patients with infantile spasms, 62.5% in those with Dravet syndrome and 50% in Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome. Side effects occurred in 28%, but discontinuation of the KD was not required in any case. They most often observed with concomitant topiramate (p=0.001) and valproate (p=0.046). Despite the retrospective nature of the study and the inhomogeneous patient sample, we found good long-term effects of the KD on seizure frequency, EEG and neurological development.

"	"To study whether onset of infantile spasms manifests seasonal variation, as previously reported, and whether any such seasonality is associated with treatment response and long-term outcome, data for 57 patients were retrospectively reviewed. The data were collected from hospital files and through a mail survey of children with infantile spasms born from 1980 to 2002 and monitored at the University Children's Hospital of Berne, Switzerland. The mean age at time of onset of infantile spasms was 7 months (range, 0.75-40), at diagnosis 8 months (range, 1-42) and at follow-up 11.3 years (range, 1-23 years). In 77% of participants, the etiology of infantile spasms was known (symptomatic); in the remaining 23% it was not known (nonsymptomatic). In contrast to previous findings, onset of infantile spasms was not associated with calendar month, photoperiod, or global solar radiation. Long-term prognosis was poor: 4 of the 57 (7%) children died; 49 (86%) had cognitive impairment and 40 (70%) had physical impairment; 31 (54%) had cerebral palsy, 37 had (65%) persistent seizures, and 9 (16%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Symptomatic infantile spasms were associated with worse cognitive outcome (P < 0.001), but treatment modality and overall duration of infantile spasms were not. There was no association of calendar month or photoperiod at onset with cognitive outcome or treatment response.

"	"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients with intractable epilepsy. Better clinical outcomes were recorded in nonfocal and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We conducted a 2-year, open label, prospective study to measure the seizure outcome of 26 VNS patients. The seizure numbers were assessed using clinician's global impression scale (CGI) and patient diaries. The average seizure reduction was 23% at the first year and 22% at the second year. Seizure reduction was more pronounced among patients with nonfocal than with focal epilepsy. The response rate was 50% at first year and 30% at the second year. The best CGI record for clinically significant improvement was 15% in the LGS group. The only statistically significant result was the reduction of the generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The side-effect profile was good; however, the large number of mild and reversible effects influenced the stimulation parameters and thus probably the effectiveness of the therapy. We suggest that VNS is an optional treatment mostly in cases of therapy-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients with GTCS may experience improvement such as reduction of seizure severity. We conclude that VNS is a safe neuromodulatory treatment, but future developments of neuromodulatory approaches are needed.

"	"Rufinamide is a new antiepileptic drug recently approved as adjunctive treatment for generalized seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We undertook a retrospective analysis of 77 patients with refractory epilepsy and receiving rufinamide to evaluate the drug's efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing schedules. It appeared efficacious in diverse epilepsy syndromes, with the highest responder rate in focal cryptogenic epilepsies (81.1% of patients with >50% response rate), and in diverse seizure types, with the highest responder rate in tonic/atonic and partial seizures (48.6% and 46.7% of patients with >50% response rate, respectively). Rufinamide was well tolerated: only 13% of patients developed side effects necessitating drug withdrawal. These findings suggest that rufinamide may possess good efficacy and tolerability, and that its efficacy may extend to epilepsy syndromes beyond Lennox-Gastaut, including both partial and generalized epilepsy syndromes.

The patients were enrolled in a prospective, add-on, open-label treatment study from 11 Italian centers for children and adolescent epilepsy care. Forty-three patients (26 males, 17 females), aged between 4 and 34 years (mean 15.9 ± 7.3, median 15.0), were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months). Twenty patients were diagnosed as cryptogenic and 23 as symptomatic. Rufinamide was added to the baseline therapy at the starting dose of 10mg/kg body weight, evenly divided in two daily doses and then increased by 10mg/kg approximately every 3 days up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day in children aged ≥4 years with a body weight less than 30 kg. In patients more than 30 kg body weight, rufinamide could be titrated up to 3200 mg/day. After a mean follow-up period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months), the final mean dose of rufinamide was 33.5mg/kg/24h (range 11.5-60) if combined to valproic acid, and of 54.5mg/kg/24h (range 21.8-85.6) without valproic acid. The response rate (≥50% decrease in countable seizures) was 60.5% (26 of 45 patients) in total; 51.1% experienced a 50-99% reduction in seizure frequency and complete seizure control was achieved in the last 4 weeks follow-up by 9.3% of patients. Two patients (4.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in 13 (30.2%) and increased in 2 (4.7%). Reliable data for atypical absence seizures and myoclonic seizures were not available, as these are usually impossible to count. Ten patients (23.2%) reported adverse side effects, while taking rufinamide. They were generally mild and transient and most frequently included vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite. In conclusion, rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy reduced the number of drop attacks and major motor seizures in about 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and produced only mild or moderate adverse side effects.

Treatment of LGS is challenging because of the small number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which are effective for this syndrome, as well as the need for polytherapy in the majority of patients. This review focuses on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide, a recently approved third-generation AED with reported efficacy as adjunctive therapy for LGS. All relevant papers identified through a PubMed search on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide were reviewed. To date, the literature suggests improvements in seizure frequency for pediatric patients with LGS on rufinamide. Rufinamide appears to be especially effective for atonic or drop attack seizures. Rufinamide also displays a favorable adverse event profile compared with the older anticonvulsants, as well as a minimal number of drug interactions, making it a promising option for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS.

The median follow-up duration after lobectomy was 20 months (range, 15-54 months) and three patients had follow-up periods over 24 months. The findings of video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, structural and functional neuroimagings were compared between pre- and post-CC. Four patients had Engel class I and one patient had Engel class II outcomes following cortical resection; post-CC, compared to pre-CC, showed better localized ictal/interictal epileptiform discharges in the unilateral frontal area in two patients, in the unilateral parieto-temporo-occipital areas in one patient and in the unilateral fronto-temporal areas in the remaining two patients. Two patients had Engel Class III outcome following cortical resection; post-CC EEG continued to show multifocal epileptiform discharges but predominantly arising from a unilateral frontal area. Following CC, positron emission tomography showed localized glucose hypometabolism of which location was concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in all patient. Similarly, ictal/interictal single photon emission computed tomography also showed localized abnormalities concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in five of the six patients. Pathological assessment revealed cortical dysplasia in six patients, whereas no pathological abnormality was found in the remaining patient, who obtained Engel Class I outcome following cortical resection. CC could change EEG findings, glucose metabolisms and cerebral blood flows, and it is sometimes helpful in delineating the primary seizure focus in patients with LGS.

To investigate these networks, 11 children with LGS and 9 control children with multifocal epileptic activity were investigated using simultaneous recordings of EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) in a 3 Tesla scanner. Individual and group analyses revealed significant activation of brainstem and thalamus (especially centromedian and anterior thalamus) associated with epileptiform discharges in patients with LGS. None of the patients with multifocal epileptic activity presented with the same hemodynamic activation pattern. Because brainstem activation has been associated with infantile spasms, which often evolve into LGS, and thalamus activation has been observed in patients with primary (idiopathic generalized syndromes) and secondary (focal epilepsies) bilateral synchrony, the described network in LGS may represent the common pathogenetic pathway of these different conditions.

"	"Precise identification of epileptogenic zones in patients with intractable drug-resistant epilepsy is critical for successful epilepsy surgery. Numerous source-imaging algorithms for localizing epileptogenic zones based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been developed and validated in simulation and experimental studies. Recently, intracranial EEG (iEEG)-based imaging of epileptogenic sources has attracted interest as a promising tool for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy; however, most iEEG studies have focused on localization of epileptogenic zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated whether iEEG source imaging is a useful supplementary tool for identifying extended epileptogenic sources in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). To this end, we applied four different cortical source imaging algorithms, namely minimum norm estimation (MNE), low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA (sLORETA), and L(p)-norm estimation (p = 1.5, referred to as Lp1.5), to artificial iEEG datasets generated assuming various source sizes and locations. We also applied these four algorithms to clinical ictal iEEG recordings acquired from a pediatric patient with LGS. Interestingly, the traditional MNE algorithm outperformed the other imaging algorithms in most of our experiments, particularly in cases when larger-sized sources were activated. Although sLORETA outperformed both LORETA and Lp1.5, its performance was not as good as that of MNE. Compared to the other algorithms, the performance of Lp1.5 decayed most rapidly as the source size increased. Our findings suggest that iEEG source imaging using MNE is a promising auxiliary tool for the identification of epileptogenic zones in secondary generalized epilepsy. We anticipate that our results will provide useful guidelines for selection of an appropriate imaging algorithm for iEEG source imaging studies.

"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is an orphan drug for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in persons aged 4 years and older. Several studies have investigated the pharmaconkinetics of RUF, but information about interactions is still limited and the results are in part inconsistent. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of age, gender, daily RUF dose per body weight (mg/kg), valproic acid (VPA), and enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) on RUF concentration-to-dose ratio (RUF serum concentration/RUF dose per body weight), RUF clearance (RUF dose/RUF serum concentration), and RUF trough concentrations. Different statistical methods were used to evaluate 292 blood samples from 119 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In summary, the results using generalized estimating equation regression models confirm a moderate but statistically significant nonlinear RUF concentration-dose relationship. At steady state, the trough concentrations of RUF increase in a less than dose proportional manner. Children (younger than 12 years) had significantly lower RUF concentrations (19.0%, P < 0.001) than adults (18 years or older) on comparable RUF doses per body weight. VPA was the most frequent comedication (51%) in our patient group. Mean RUF concentrations were 86.6% higher when VPA concentrations were greater than 90 μg/mL (P < 0.001) and 45.4% higher when VPA concentrations were between 50 and 90 μg/mL (P < 0.001) but not significantly different at VPA concentrations less than 50 μg/mL (4.4%, P > 0.1) compared with combinations without VPA. In combination with EIAEDs, mean RUF concentrations were 21.8% lower (P = 0.002) compared with combinations without EIAEDs. However, the group of AEDs classified as EIAEDs was heterogeneous and the number of patients, especially of children with EIAEDs, was relatively small. Our data indicate that oxcarbazepine and, especially, methsuximide decrease RUF concentrations as well. Therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful because RUF concentrations differ markedly in patients on comparable RUF doses.

21396833	"Effectiveness of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drop-attacks and different epileptic syndromes
"	"The effectiveness of VNS was evaluated in thirty-nine encephalopatic patients with drug-resistant epilepsy characterized by multiple seizures and drop attacks. Twenty-five patients were affected by severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci (SE-MISF) and fourteen patients by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Changes in seizure frequency, cognition, adaptive behaviour and quality of life were assessed before and after VNS implant until three years. Outcome assessment for all seizure types included the number of seizures/month and the reduction in seizure frequency rate at each follow-up. Moreover, the effect of VNS on frequency, duration and intensity of drop attacks was separately addressed by a modification of McHugh scale. VNS produced a mean seizure rate reduction of 41% at six months, 50% at twelve months, and 54% at thirty-six months. After one year of stimulation, thirteen patients with SE-MISF (52%) and three patients with LGS (21%) showed a reduction above 50% in all seizures' frequency rate. As for drop attacks, eight patients (20%) gained a reduction above 50%, while seven patients (17%) showed a reduction only in intensity and duration. Cognitive level and adaptive behaviour were unchanged, while a better quality of life was reported in half out of the patients. VNS had a greater effect in reducing seizures frequency and drop attacks' intensity and duration in SE-MISF patients than LGS patients. An improved quality of life was observed also in those patients who only reduced the intensity and duration of drop attacks.

"	"Rufinamide is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged ≥4 years. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the relative bioavailability and other pharmacokinetics of rufinamide administered as a 400-mg tablet formulation (reference) with 10 mL of a newly developed 40-mg/mL suspension (test) manufactured using 3 different homogenization speeds in healthy subjects under fed conditions. The study also explored whether homogenization speed had any effect on rufinamide pharmacokinetics when administered as a suspension formulation. This was a randomized, open-label, crossover, single-dose study in healthy, fed subjects aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive), conducted at a single center in the United Kingdom. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences, with each sequence consisting of 4 treatment periods. In each treatment period, subjects received a single dose of either the reference product (400-mg rufinamide tablet) or the test product (10 mL of rufinamide suspension [40 mg/mL] manufactured using 3 different homogenization speeds [1800, 2100, and 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm)]). Serial blood samples were collected for 72 hours after dosing for the measurement of rufinamide in plasma. Primary comparisons between test (suspension) and reference (tablet) formulations focused on AUC from 0 to 72 hours (AUC(0-72 h)) and C(max). The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the ratios of geometric least squares means and associated 90% CIs of AUC(0-72 h) and C(max) were within the predetermined range of 80%-125%, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements. Tolerability was assessed by subject interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Twenty-four healthy subjects were randomized: 8 were male and 16 were female; 22 white, 1 black, and 1 Asian subjects were enrolled. Mean (SD) age was 29.8 (10.0) years. Mean weight was 68.2 (11.0) kg, and mean body mass index was 23.6 (3.0) kg/m(2). Twenty-one subjects completed the study; 2 subjects discontinued because of adverse events (both urinary tract infections considered unrelated to treatment) and 1 because of protocol deviation. The 72-hour pharmacokinetic data for the last complete treatment period before discontinuation were included in group means. The geometric least squares mean C(max) value for the reference tablet formulation was 4840.24 ng/mL; and 4254.87, 4204.29, and 4418.44 ng/mL for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm test suspensions, respectively. The ratios of the geometric least squares mean values (test/reference) for C(max) were 0.88 (90% CI, 0.84-0.92), 0.87 (0.83-0.91) and 0.91 (0.88-0.95) for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively, compared with the tablet formulation. The geometric least squares mean AUC(0-72 h) values were 75,960.48 ng · h/mL for the tablet formulation and 74,279.02, 73,746.03, and 73,701.17 ng · h/mL for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively. The ratios of the geometric least squares mean values (test/reference) for AUC(0-72 h) were 0.98 (90% CI, 0.95-1.00), 0.97 (0.95-1.00) and 0.97 (0.95-0.99) for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively, compared with the tablet formulation. The ratios and associated 90% CI limits (for test suspensions to the reference tablet) for AUC(0-72 h) and C(max) were within the FDA and EMA criteria for assuming bioequivalence to the 400 mg tablet. Comparisons among the 3 rufinamide test suspensions also met the regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to one another. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 18.2% (4/22) of subjects treated with the 400-mg tablet, 21.7% (5/23) of subjects treated with the 1800-rpm suspension, 26.1% (6/23) of subjects treated with the 2100-rpm suspension, and 8.7% (2/23) of subjects treated with the 3000-rpm suspension. Overall, 54.2% (13/24) of subjects experienced a TEAE; all TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, with headache being the most frequently reported (37.5% [9/24]). There were no serious adverse events or deaths. This single-dose study in a small population of fed, healthy subjects found no statistically significant differences in relative bioavailability among each of the 3 test suspensions and the currently marketed 400-mg tablet formulation of rufinamide, meeting FDA and EMA regulatory requirements for assuming bioequivalence.

"	"Targeting pro-inflammatory events to reduce seizures is gaining momentum. Experimentally, antagonism of inflammatory processes and of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage has been demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing status epilepticus (SE). Clinically, a role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of drug resistant epilepsies is suspected. However, the use anti-inflammatory drug such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) is limited to selected pediatric epileptic syndromes and spasms. Lack of animal data may be one of the reasons for the limited use of GCs in epilepsy. We evaluated the effect of the CG dexamethasone in reducing the onset and the severity of pilocarpine SE in rats. We assessed BBB integrity by measuring serum S100β and Evans Blue brain extravasation. Electrophysiological monitoring and hematologic measurements (WBCs and IL-1β) were performed. We reviewed the effect of add on dexamethasone treatment on a population of pediatric patients affected by drug resistant epilepsy. We excluded subjects affected by West, Landau-Kleffner or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and Rasmussen encephalitis, known to respond to GCs or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effect of two additional GCs, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, was also reviewed in this population. When dexamethasone treatment preceded exposure to the convulsive agent pilocarpine, the number of rats developing status epilepticus (SE) was reduced. When SE developed, the time-to-onset was significantly delayed compared to pilocarpine alone and mortality associated with pilocarpine-SE was abolished. Dexamethasone significantly protected the BBB from damage. The clinical study included pediatric drug resistant epileptic subjects receiving add on GC treatments. Decreased seizure frequency (≥ 50%) or interruption of status epilepticus was observed in the majority of the subjects, regardless of the underlying pathology. Our experimental results point to a seizure-reducing effect of dexamethasone. The mechanism encompasses improvement of BBB integrity. Our results also suggest that add on GCs could be of efficacy in controlling pediatric drug resistant seizures.

"	"Neuroscientists are becoming interested in the application of computational EEG analysis to the identification of ictal onset zones; however, most studies have focused on the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. The present study aimed to estimate the ictal onset zone of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) with bilaterally synchronous epileptiform discharges from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings using directional connectivity analysis. We analyzed ictal iEEG data acquired from three LGS patients who underwent epileptic surgery with favorable surgical outcomes. To identify the ictal onset zones, we estimated the functional directional connectivity network among the intracerebral electrodes using the directed transfer function (DTF) method. The analysis results demonstrated that areas with high average outflow values corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified using electrophysiologic data and conventional neuroimaging modalities. Our results suggest that the DTF analysis can be a useful auxiliary tool for determining surgical resection areas prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients. This is the first research article demonstrating that directional connectivity analysis of iEEG recording data can be used for delineating surgical resection areas in generalized epilepsy patients who need surgical treatment.

New AEDs have been validated in randomized, controlled trials for the treatment of seizures in LGS. In some cases, nonpharmacologic options may be effective, although more data are needed to confirm efficacy outcomes.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by the occurrence of multiple types of seizures and cognitive decline. Most children suffer from frequent seizures that are refractory to current medical management. Recent clinical trials have suggested that addition of clobazam may improve the clinical outcome for some LGS patients. Although clobazam has been available for over five decades, it has only recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. As a 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam is structurally related to the widely used 1,4-benzodiazepines, which include diazepam. Clobazam has been shown to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission by positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors, and to increase expression of transporters for both GABA and glutamate. The active metabolite n-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) also modulates GABA(A) receptors, and the relative importance of these two compounds in the clinical effectiveness of clobazam remains an open question. Clinical trials involving clobazam as an addon therapy in a variety of pediatric epilepsy populations have found a significant improvement in seizure control. In patients with LGS, clobazam may have greatest efficacy for drop seizures. Longstanding clinical experience suggests that clobazam is a safe and well tolerated antiepileptic drug with infrequent and mild adverse effects. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with clobazam may be a reasonable option for LGS patients, particularly those who are treatment-resistant.

"	"The arrhythmogenic potential of short QT intervals has recently been highlighted in patients with a short QT syndrome. Drug-induced QT-interval prolongation is a known risk factor for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, reports on drug-induced QT-interval shortening are rare and proarrhythmic effects remain unclear. Recently, rufinamide, a new antiepileptic drug for the add-on treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, was approved in the European Union and the United States. Initial trials showed drug-induced QT-interval shortening. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of rufinamide on QT intervals in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Nineteen consecutive patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other epilepsy syndromes were included (n = 12 men; mean age 41 ± 12 years). QRS, QT, and T(peak)-T(end) intervals were analyzed before and during rufinamide treatment. The mean QT interval shortened significantly following rufinamide administration (QT interval 349 ± 23 ms vs 327 ± 17 ms; corrected QT interval 402 ± 22 ms vs 382 ± 16 ms; P = .002). T(peak)-T(end) intervals were 79 ± 17 ms before and 70 ± 20 ms on treatment (P = .07). The mean reduction of the corrected QT interval was 20 ± 18 ms. During follow-up (3.04 ± 1.09 years), no adverse events including symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths were observed. QTc-interval shortening following oral rufinamide administration in a small patient group was not associated with significant clinical adverse effects. These observations notwithstanding, the ability of rufinamide to significantly shorten the QT interval portends a potential arrhythmogenic risk that may best be guarded against by periodic electrocardiographic recordings.

22255466	"Localization of ictal onset zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using directed transfer function method
"	"Neuroscientists are becoming interested in the application of computational EEG analysis to the identification of ictal onset zones, however, most studies have focused on the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. The present study aimed to estimate the ictal onset zone of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) with bilaterally synchronous epileptiform discharges from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings using directional connectivity analysis. We analyzed ictal iEEG data acquired from three patients with LGS. To identify the ictal onset zones, we estimated the functional directional connectivity network among the intracerebral electrodes using the directed transfer function (DTF) method. The analysis results demonstrated that areas with high average outflow values corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified using electrophysiologic data and conventional neuroimaging modalities. Our results suggest that the DTF analysis can be a useful auxiliary tool for determining surgical resection areas prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients.

"	"We discuss the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as adjunctive therapy in 64 paediatric patients with refractory epilepsies. Sixty-four patients (34 male and 30 female) implanted with VNS for refractory epilepsy were analysed. Electroclinical features were compatible with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 46 patients, focal epilepsies in 10 patients, Dravet syndrome in three patients, epilepsy with myoclonic-astatic seizures in three patients, and West syndrome in two. The NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) system (Cyberonics, Webster, TX, USA) was employed and the following stimulation parameters were used: output current of 1 to 2.5mA, signal frequency of 30Hz, signal pulse width of 500μs, and signal ""on"" and ""off"" times of 30  seconds and 5  minutes, respectively. Of 46 patients with LGS, 30 cases showed a significant improvement in seizure control, with a reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50%. Ten patients with focal epilepsy, three patients with myoclonic-astatic seizures, two patients with Dravet, and two patients with West showed a significant improvement in seizure control, with a reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50%. A good clinical response was evident early and efficacy progressively improved with the duration of treatment up to 36 months. In a significant number of patients, reduced seizure severity and shorter recovery time and hospital stay were also observed. VNS was well tolerated in all patients. VNS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for paediatric patients with refractory epilepsies, improving quality of life and neuropsychological performance.

"	"We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the orphan drug rufinamide (RUF) in children with pharmacoresistant myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome). This was a retrospective European multicenter study on eight patients who had started an intention-to-treat trial of RUF between July 2007 and June 2010. Clinical information was collected via questionnaire. Responder rate was defined as reduction of seizure frequency ≥50% in comparison to four weeks before starting RUF. Maximum follow-up was eighteen months. Responder rates were 7/8 patients after 3 months, 6/8 patients after 6 months and 5/8 patients after 12 months. RUF seemed particularly effective in the prevention of myoclonic-astatic seizures (comparable with drop attacks in Lennox-Gastaut-Syndrome, for which RUF is particularly effective). Some loss of efficacy was noticed in the long-term observation. Side-effects occurred in two patients. Seizure aggravation was not observed. RUF seems to be a promising therapeutic option in children with MAE. Further studies are warranted to confirm these first observations.

22421185	"Rufinamide as an adjuvant treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"To evaluate the efficacy of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in children and adolescents with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The study was an open-label, observational clinical trial of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in intractable LGS patients. This intent-to-treat trial included 4 weeks of scheduled titrated doses and a 12-week maintenance phase with a target dose of 20-40 mg/kg rufinamide, adjusted according to its effectiveness and tolerability after a baseline period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome was measured by the seizure-reduction rate according to individual seizure type over the 12-week maintenance period. One hundred and twenty-eight patients with LGS who were determined to be unresponsive to one or more antiepileptic drugs or dietary therapy were enrolled. Of the 128 patients enrolled, 112 (87.5%) completed the study. After add-on rufinamide treatment, 46 patients (35.9%) achieved a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 10 (7.8%) patients became seizure-free. When we identified those who responded with an at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency, 39.4% of the responders reported reductions in convulsive seizures, 36.4% in drop attacks, 33.3% in myoclonic seizures, and 20.0% in epileptic spasms. Overall, 32.8% of patients reported adverse effects, which were mostly mild and transient in nature. The most common adverse effects were fatigue (15 patients, 11.7%) and poor appetite (9 patients, 7.0%). Twenty-one (16.4%) patients experienced an increased seizure frequency. Rufinamide appears to be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for many cases of intractable LGS.

"	"To investigate potential drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme substrates, inhibitors, and inducers. Two, prospective, open-label, single-center, drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies and a population pharmacokinetics analysis of seven multicenter phase II-III trials. Clinical research unit. Fifty-four healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the two drug-drug interaction studies; 53 completed the studies. The population pharmacokinetics analysis evaluated data from 171 participants from five studies with healthy volunteers and two studies with patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Participants in these studies received clobazam and stable dosages of the following antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, felbamate, or oxcarbazepine. In the first drug-drug interaction study, 36 participants received a single oral dose of clobazam 10 mg on day 1, followed by either ketoconazole 400 mg once/day or omeprazole 40 mg once/day on days 17-22, with a single dose of clobazam 10 mg coadministered on day 22, to study the effects of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibition, respectively, on clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB). In the second study, 18 participants received a drug cocktail consisting of caffeine 200 mg, tolbutamide 500 mg, dextromethorphan 30 mg, and midazolam 4 mg on days 1 and 19, and clobazam 40 mg/day on days 4-19, to study clobazam's effects on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In the first DDI study, coadministration of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and clobazam increased clobazam's area under the concentration time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) 54% and decreased clobazam's maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) by 15% versus administration of clobazam alone, but the combination affected these pharmacokinetic parameters for N-CLB to a lesser degree. The CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole increased AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of N-CLB by 36% and 15%, respectively, but did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. At steady state, N-CLB has 3-4 times greater exposure than clobazam. In the second DDI study, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions were observed between clobazam 40 mg and the CYP probe substrates caffeine or tolbutamide. Exposure to midazolam and its 1-hydroxymidazolam metabolite, however, decreased by 27% and increased 4-fold, respectively. Clobazam increased dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) AUC(0-∞) by 95% and C(max) by 59%. In the population pharmacokinetics analysis, stable dosages of common antiepileptic drugs that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C19, or inhibit CYP2C19, had negligible effects on clobazam or N-CLB. Clobazam did not affect valproic acid or lamotrigine exposures. These findings suggest no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions between clobazam and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, or CYP2C9. Concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require dosage adjustment. Clobazam may be administered safely as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, without meaningful changes in clobazam pharmacokinetics that would require dosage adjustment.

"	"To determine the efficacy of the ketogenic diet for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) at our institution and in the literature. The records of children with LGS initiated on the ketogenic diet at our institution from 1994 to 2010 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included the presence of ≤2.5Hz spike-and-wave complexes on electroencephalogram, multiple seizure types including tonic, atonic, or atypical absence, developmental delay, and age under 1 year. We additionally reviewed the literature for cases of LGS treated with the ketogenic diet and their outcomes. Seventy-one children (41 males, 30 females, median age 3y 6mo, range 18mo-18y), with LGS were initiated on the ketogenic diet. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, after 6 months, 36 (51%) achieved more than 50% seizure reduction, 16 (23%) experienced more than 90% seizure reduction, and 1 (1%) achieved seizure freedom. Results were similar after 12 months. Age, sex, side effects, valproate use, and history of infantile spasms were not predictive of more than 90% seizure reduction. In the literature, 88 of 189 (47%) children with LGS had more than 50% seizure reduction after 3 to 36 months of ketogenic diet treatment. The ketogenic diet is efficacious in the treatment of LGS, with approximately one-half of children responding at 12 months.

"	"Lacosamide is a new antiepileptic drug that is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults 17 years or older for partial-onset seizures. The authors reviewed 21 pediatric patients (<17 years) with various seizure types who were started on oral lacosamide as part of a prospective add-on study as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy. Five patients were excluded due to less than 3 months of meaningful follow-up. Maintenance dosages used ranged from 2.4 to 19.4 mg/kg/d. Eight of 16 (50%) patients had greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency with adjunctive lacosamide therapy. Eight (50%) patients had generalized epilepsy including 4 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lacosamide was effective therapy for most seizure types but was particularly effective for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide was effective in treating 5 of 8 (62.5%) localization-related epilepsies but only 2 of 8 (25%) generalized epilepsies, both Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients with greater than 90% seizure reduction. None of these very refractory patients remained seizure free.

The third patient had cryptogenic CSWSS syndrome at age the age of 7 years which evolved into LGS at the age of 7.5 years. All three patients could be considered to have two EE: CSWSS syndrome and LGS or to have had overlapping features of these epileptic syndromes.

In this study we report the results of resective surgery in 18 patients with LGS phenotype who underwent single-lobe/lesionectomy or multilobe resection plus multiple subpial transection and/or callosotomy. After surgery, seven patients became completely seizure-free (Engel Class I) and five almost seizure-free (Engel Class II). Additional four had significant seizure control (Engel Class III), and two had no change in seizure frequency (Engel Class IV). Of the 4 patients without any lesion on brain MRI, 2 ended with Engel Class II, 1 with III and the other with IV in Engels' classification. Mean intelligence quotient (IQ) increased from 56.1 ± 8.1 (mean ± SD) before operation to 67.4 ± 8.2 (mean ± SD) after operation, a significant improvement (P = 0.001). Results also indicated that the younger the patient at surgery, or the shorter the interval between onset of seizure and resective operation, the better the intellectual outcome. Our data suggest that resective epilepsy surgery can be successful in patients with LGS phenotype as long as the EEG shows dominance of discharges in one hemisphere and corresponding ipsilateral imaging findings, even with contralateral ictal discharges.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of add-on Rufinamide in the treatment of childhood focal drug resistant epilepsy. We recruited 70 patients for a prospective, add-on, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were: 3 years of age or more; focal drug resistant epilepsy despite the use of three previous AEDs; use of at least one other AED, but no more than three at baseline; more than one seizure per month in the previous 6 months. Rufinamide efficacy was observed up to 12 months of follow-up, with a total responder rate of 38.57%. We found the best results in focal epilepsies due to structural/metabolic etiology (42.6%). The responder rate was similar for focal seizures with secondary generalization, simple focal seizures other than myoclonic jerks, and complex partial seizures. Response to Rufinamide was not related to the age. Our experience suggests that Rufinamide can be effective in reducing focal seizure frequency in children with drug resistant epilepsy, and that it can be considered as a safe drug.

"	"Corpus callosotomy is usually intended to alleviate-not to achieve total control of-epileptic seizures. A few patients experience complete seizure control after callosotomy, but the associated clinical factors are unknown. The object of this study was to investigate clinical factors associated with long-term seizure remission after total corpus callosotomy in patients with infantile or early childhood onset epilepsy. Thirteen consecutive patients with infantile or early childhood onset epilepsy underwent 1-stage total corpus callosotomy for alleviation of seizures. Their age at surgery ranged from 1 year and 5 months to 24 years (median 7 years). Eleven patients had West syndrome at the onset of disease, and the other 2 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. All patients suffered from spasms, axial tonic seizures, or atonic seizures. Six patients had proven etiology of epilepsy, including tuberous sclerosis, polymicrogyria, trauma, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. The association between postoperative seizure freedom and preoperative factors including age at surgery, no MRI abnormalities, proven etiology, and focal electroencephalographic epileptiform discharges was examined. Postoperative seizure freedom was achieved in 4 of 13 patients for a minimum of 12 months. All 4 patients had no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology. None of the 8 patients with MRI abnormality, 6 patients with known etiology of epilepsy, or 4 patients aged older than 10 years at surgery achieved seizure freedom. Two of the 7 patients with focal electroencephalographic abnormalities became seizure free. Absence of MRI abnormalities was significantly associated with postoperative seizure freedom (p < 0.01). Complete seizure remission is achieved after total corpus callosotomy in a subgroup of patients with intractable epilepsy following West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. One-stage total corpus callosotomy at a young age may provide a higher rate of seizure freedom, especially for patients with no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology of epilepsy.

"	"Severely and multiply disabled children (SMDC) are frequently affected in more than one area of development, resulting in multiple disabilities.  The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy in SMDC using monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous system, by the frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability.  We studied six patients with SMDC (3 patients with cerebral palsy, 1 patient with posttraumatic syndrome after head injury, 1 patient with herpes encephalitis sequelae, and 1 patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome characterized by frequent seizures, developmental delay and psychological and behavioral problems), aged 18-26 (mean 22.5 ± 3.5).  By frequency domain method using electrocardiography, we measured the high frequency (HF; with a frequency ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), which represents parasympathetic activity, the low frequency/high frequency ratio, which represents sympathetic activity between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, and heart rate.  A music therapist performed therapy to all patients through the piano playing for 50 min.  We monitored each study participant for 150 min before therapy, 50 min during therapy, and 10 min after therapy.  Interestingly, four of 6 patients showed significantly lower HF components during music therapy than before therapy, suggesting that these four patients might react to music therapy through the suppression of parasympathetic nervous activities.  Thus, music therapy can suppress parasympathetic nervous activities in some patients with SMDC.  The monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous activities could be a powerful tool for the objective evaluation of music therapy in patients with SMDC.

"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a novel antiepileptic drug considered as second-line therapy in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) have consisted mainly of drowsiness, irritability, vomiting, and loss of appetite. RUF is considered as a ""weight-neutral"" drug. We found clinically significant weight loss in 7 of 15 consecutive adult patients (47%; 3 male, 4 female, aged 18-31 years) treated with RUF as add-on therapy (800-2,400 mg/day: 23.5-57.1 mg/kg/day). The body mass index (BMI) decreased by 7.3-18.7%. Two patients were obese class I before RUF. Five patients (71%) were underweight before RUF (mild in one case, moderate in two cases, and severe in two cases). Four of these patients stopped RUF because of this adverse effect. RUF was recommenced in two patients using a lower and slower dosing strategy; one patient showed improvement in seizure control and no weight loss but RUF was re-stopped in the second patient because of continued weight loss. Despite of weight loss, RUF was continued in two other patients because it reduced seizure activity. We primarily related weight loss to reduced food intake, that is, loss of appetite and nausea, although in two patients no obvious loss of appetite was reported. RUF can cause clinically significant weight loss in adult patients, even at low dose. This AE can affect patients who are already underweight. There is a possibility that lower starting doses and slower escalation might minimize weight loss, but further information is required to determine whether this is the case.

"	"We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate cortical excitability changes in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), anticipating we would find a marked increase in excitability compared to other patients with refractory epilepsies. Eighteen patients with LGS were studied. Motor threshold (MT), short intracortical inhibition (paired pulse TMS at 2 and 5 msec interstimulus intervals [ISIs]), intracortical facilitation (10 and 15 msec ISIs), and long intracortical inhibition (100-300 msec ISIs) were measured. Results were compared to those of 20 patients with chronic refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), 20 patients with chronic refractory focal epilepsy, and 20 healthy nonepilepsy controls. A significant decrease in cortical excitability was observed in LGS compared to the other two groups with refractory epilepsy as evidenced by increased MT and intracortical inhibition at both short (2, 5 msec ISIs), and long (100-300 msec ISIs) as well as decreased intracortical facilitation (10, 15 msec ISIs), (p < 0.01; effect sizes ranging from 0.3 to 1.8). Cortical excitability was also lower in LGS compared to nonepilepsy controls (increased MT and decreased intracortical facilitation; p < 0.05; effect sizes ranging from 0.5 to 0.9). Interictal cortical excitability is decreased in LGS; a feature that distinguishes it from other refractory epilepsy syndromes. This decrease may be an important mechanism for the neurobehavioral comorbidities associated with LGS.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an uncommon epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, we tried to determine the clinical and EEG characteristics of patients with LGS in south Iran. In this retrospective study, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of LGS were recruited at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 2008 through 2012. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), epilepsy risk factors, EEG and imaging findings of all patients were registered routinely. During the study period, 2500 patients with epilepsy were registered at our epilepsy clinic. One-hundred and thirty-five patients (5.4%) were diagnosed as having LGS. Age of onset (mean±standard deviation) was 3.2±3.8 years. In 14 (10.4%) patients, age of onset was above 8 years. Eighty-three patients (61.5%) were male and 52 (38.5%) were female. The most common seizure type was tonic, followed by generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. The most common EEG finding was slow spike-wave complexes. The most common abnormal MRI finding was brain atrophy. LGS is an uncommon epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple seizure types, a specific electroencephalographic pattern and psychomotor retardation, beginning in childhood. However, variants of this classical triad including atypical EEG findings, normal psychomotor function, and late-onset disease could be seen in some patients.

22934193	"Lesions of acetylcholine neurons in refractory epilepsy
"	"We have examined brainstem lesions in patients with refractory epilepsy disorders, including West syndrome (WS), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Acetylcholinergic neurons (AchNs) in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) are involved in mental development, and disruption of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can lead to epilepsy. In order to investigate the involvement of lesions of AchNs in refractory epilepsy, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of AchNs in the PPN in autopsy cases who had a past history of WS and/or LGS and in DRPLA cases who showed progressive myoclonic epilepsy. In addition, we performed a preliminary quantification of the levels of acetylcholine, neuropeptides, and monoamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with WS and benign convulsions associated with mild gastroenteritis (CwG). In the PPN analysis, the total number of neurons and the number of AchNs were reduced in WS/LGS and WS cases, while DRPLA cases showed a decrease in the number and percentage of AchNs. In the CSF analysis, WS patients demonstrated a reduction in the levels of inhibitory neuropeptides, while CwG patients showed increased levels of acetylcholine and decreased levels of serotonin metabolites. These data suggest the possible involvement of lesions of AchNs in WS and DRPLA.

"	"Atypical absence epilepsy (AAE) showing slow spike-and-wave discharges (SWD) is characterized by severely abnormal cognition and neurodevelopmental or neurological outcomes in humans. However, despite the severe behavioral outcomes in AAE, the relationship between AAE and social-behavioral dysfunctions has not defined well, either experimentally or in patients with AAE. Experimentally, AAE can be produced by administering AY-9944 (AY), a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor. In this study, we characterized social behavior in the AY mouse model of AAE. AAE in the mouse was induced by repeated postnatal administration of AY every 6 days from postnatal day (P) 2 to P20. AY-treated mice exhibited spontaneous, recurrent, and synchronous SWD (4-5 Hz) in electroencephalographic recordings. AY-treated mice performed tasks involving sociability/social novelty preference, social interaction with a juvenile conspecific, observational fear, and resident-intruder aggression. They showed behavioral dysfunction in social interactions with a juvenile conspecific and sociability/social novelty preference tasks. They also exhibited reduced social fear learning in observational fear conditioning. Interestingly, they showed increased levels of offensive behaviors in a resident-intruder task. However, AY-treated mice displayed normal levels of anxiety in light/dark transition and the elevated plus maze tasks, and showed slightly increased locomotor activity in an open-field task. These results demonstrate social dysfunction in the AY-induced AAE model. Our study of social behavior can also provide valuable information about Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, in which AAE is a component. Thus, our findings may help to understand behavioral pathogenesis or characteristics of patients with AAE.

"	"In the study of 887 new born infants with prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage, 11 children with West syndrome that progressed into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and another 4 children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome that had not been preceded by West syndrome were found. In this study we present the main findings of these 15 subjects. In all infants multifactor antecedents were detected. The most frequent risk factors were prematurity and severe asphyxia; however placenta disorders, sepsis, and hyperbilirubinemia were also frequent. In all infants MRI direct or secondary features of periventricular leukomalacia were observed. Followup of all infants showed moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delay as well as cerebral palsy. It is concluded that prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage are very important antecedents that should be taken into account to follow up those infants from an early age in order to detect and treat as early as possible an epileptic encephalopathy.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED), which is known to be effective in the treatment of partial seizures and drop attacks in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in those with LGS. Patients with LGS who had received rufinamide adjunctive therapy were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively reviewed these patient's baseline clinical characteristics, and the reduction of seizure frequency and adverse events after the use of rufinamide. Twenty-three patients (15 males and 8 females, ages 4-22 years) were enrolled in the study. All the patients suffered from daily head drops and tonic seizures despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. After one month of rufinamide, one patient (4.3%) achieved freedom from seizures, ten (43.5%) achieved a ≥50% decrease in seizure frequency. After six months of rufinamide, eight patients (34.8%) maintained a satisfactory response (seizure free in one, and greater than 50% seizure reduction in seven). Adverse events were reported in six (26.0%) patients, which were somnolence in three, aggressive behavior in two, and aggravation of seizure in one patient. Our results suggest that rufinamide is effective and safe in children and young adults with LGS.

There were 36 cases of PVS diagnosed. In Beijing, there were 19 cases: mean age 57 years, range 3-86, (42 %) female, with 37 % of patients observed to survive more than 1 year (range >1 month to >28 years, median >6 months). Causes of PVS in Beijing were hemorrhagic stroke (n = 4, 21 %), ischemic stroke (n = 2, 11 %), cardiac arrest (n = 5, 26 %, including 4 with attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)), traumatic brain injury (n = 3, 16 %), and one each of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and epilepsy with craniopharyngioma (n = 4, 21 %). In Baltimore, there were 17 cases of PVS: mean age 43 years, range 15-83, 59 % female, with 41 % observed to survive more than 1 year (range >1 month to >10 years, median >3 years). Causes of PVS in Baltimore were ischemic stroke (n = 3, 18 %), cardiac arrest (n = 3, 18 %, including one with attempted CPR), traumatic brain injury (n = 3, 18 %), neurodegenerative conditions (n = 2, 12 %), and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to respiratory arrest (n = 3, 18 %), metabolic derangements (n = 2, 12 %), and meningitis (n = 1, 6 %). There may be a long survival period for patients with PVS, including in China where resource constraints exist for acute neurologic care. Stroke appears to be the most common underlying cause of PVS in Chinese patients, followed closely by cardiac arrest with attempted CPR. There appear to be more varied causes of PVS in the US referral hospital with a predominance of stroke, cardiac arrest, and traumatic brain injury.

"	"Epileptic encephalopathies are an epileptic condition characterized by epileptiform abnormalities associated with progressive cerebral dysfunction. In the classification of the International League Against Epilepsy eight age-related epileptic encephalopathy syndromes are recognized. These syndromes include early myoclonic encephalopathy and Ohtahara syndrome in the neonatal period, West syndrome and Dravet syndrome in infancy, myoclonic status in nonprogressive encephalopathies, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and epilepsy with continuous spike waves during slow wave sleep in childhood and adolescences. Other epileptic syndromes such as migrating partial seizures in infancy and severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci may be reasonably added. In this paper, we provide an overview of epileptic encephalopathies including clinical neurophysiological features, cognitive deterioration, and management options especially that these conditions are generally refractory to standard antiepileptic drugs.

"	"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Little is known about VNS therapy for children with epilepsy. This article will: (1) Review the contemporary medical literature related to VNS therapy in children with epilepsy, (2) describe the experience of VNS treatment in 153 children less than 18 years of age, in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Program, from 1998 to 2012, and (3) describe the surgical technique used for VNS implantation at UCLA. Review of the literature finds that despite different etiologies and epilepsy syndromes in children, VNS appears to show a similar profile of efficacy for seizure control compared to adults, and low morbidity and mortality. The UCLA experience is similar to that reported in the literature for children. VNS constitutes about 21% of our pediatric epilepsy surgery volume. We have implanted VNS in infants as young as six months of age and the most common etiology is the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. About 5% of the patients are seizure-free with VNS therapy and there is a low rate of surgically related complications. The UCLA surgical approach emphasizes minimal direct manipulation of the vagus nerve and adequate wire loops, to prevent a lead fracture. In summary, VNS is a viable palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy in children, with outcomes and complications equal to adult patients. Being a small child is not a contraindication for VNS therapy, if needed for refractory epilepsy.

Forty-six patients with LGS who had received CLB add-on therapy were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, including type of seizures, use of CLB, efficacy, adverse events, and retention rate. The mean±SD dose of CLB was 0.70±0.37 mg/kg per day (range, 0.16-1.60 mg/kg per day). After 1 month on CLB, 15 patients (32.6%) became seizure-free and 10 patients (21.7%) had 50% or greater seizure reduction. Response to CLB was not significantly associated with age, sex, or etiology (symptomatic or not). Five (10.8%) of 46 patients maintained seizure remission for more than 12 months. Tolerance developed in 48.0% of initial responders, and the 3-year retention rate by the Kaplan-Meier method was 76.6%. Seven patients (15.2%) reported adverse events, including somnolence and behavioral change, but only one discontinued CLB.

23354062	"Localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using frequency domain source imaging of intracranial electroencephalography: a preliminary investigation
"	"Although intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) has been widely used to localize epileptogenic zones in epilepsy, visual inspection of iEEG recordings does not always result in a favorable surgical outcome, especially in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Various computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been introduced to confirm the visual inspection results. Of these methods, high gamma oscillation in iEEG has attracted interest because a series of studies have reported a close relationship between epileptogenic zones and cortical areas with high gamma oscillation. Meanwhile, frequency domain source imaging of EEG and MEG oscillations has proven to be a useful auxiliary tool for identifying rough locations of epileptogenic zones. To the best of our knowledge, however, frequency domain source imaging of high gamma iEEG oscillations has not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether the iEEG-based frequency domain source imaging of high gamma oscillation (60-100 Hz) would be a useful supplementary tool for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. The method was applied to three successfully operated on LGS patients, whose iEEG contained some ictal events with distinct high gamma oscillations before seizure onset. The resultant cortical source distributions were compared with surgical resection areas and with high gamma spectral power distributions on the intracranial sensor plane. While the results of the sensor-level analyses contained many spurious activities, the results of frequency domain source imaging coincided better with the surgical resection areas, suggesting that the frequency domain source imaging of iEEG high gamma oscillations might help enhance the accuracy of pre-surgical evaluations of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy.

Only two of four mutation carriers with neonatal seizures had Ohtahara syndrome. Epileptic spasms were present in five of six patients. One patient with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but focal seizures underwent epilepsy surgery and seizure frequency dropped drastically. Neuropathology showed a focal cortical dysplasia type 1a. There is a need for additional neuropathologic studies to explore whether STXBP1 mutations can lead to structural brain abnormalities.

We studied 21 patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy for CNVs using whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Eight patients (38%) carried rare CNVs that might contribute to their phenotype. The pathogenicity could be questioned in some of them, but in four patients (19%) a causative role was considered highly probable. Three had CNVs and clinical features consistent with known genetic syndromes: 22q13.3 deletion, 2q23.1 deletion, and MECP2 duplication. There is a high frequency of rare CNVs in adult patients with LGS-like epilepsy. The phenotypes of these background disorders may be obscured by the effects of intractable seizures and massive antiepileptic drug treatment. Previously, syndromic disorders were primarily identified by their clinical features; however, a genome wide approach with identification of the genotype might shed light on the phenotype.

Fatty acids are the most important constituent of the KD in all aspects of efficacy and complications. Among fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increase anticonvulsant properties and reduce the complications associated with the high-fat diet. Here, we report a 7-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome combined with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency, whose medically intractable seizures have been successfully controlled with a PUFA-enriched modified Atkins diet without any significant adverse events. The diet consists of canola oil and diverse menu items like fish and nuts instead of olive oil and has an ideal 1:2.8 ratio of omega-3 to omega-6. In addition, fractionation of this boy's plasma showed normal levels of fatty acids, including omega-3 (alpha-linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid, arachidonic acid) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid). Plasma docosahexanoic acid remained low after PUFA-enriched diet therapy. PUFA-enriched diet therapy is likely to increase the efficacy of diet therapy and reduce complications of a high-fat diet in children with refractory epilepsy.

Palliative procedures such as callosotomy (Cx), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation have been offered. We compared the outcomes after Cx or VNS in two consecutive prospective cohorts of patients with generalised epilepsy. Twenty-four patients underwent callosotomy from 2006 to 2007 (Group 1); 20 additional patients were submitted to VNS from 2008 to 2009 (Group 2). They had generalised epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut or Lennox-like type. They were submitted to a neurological interview and examination, interictal and ictal video-EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI, and cognitive and quality of life evaluations. The two-year post-operative follow-up results were evaluated for each patient. The final mean stimuli intensity was 3.0 mA in the Group 2 patients. Seizure-free patients accounted for 10% in Group 1 and none in Group 2. Ten and sixteen percent of the Group 1 and 2 patients, respectively, were non-responders. Improvements in attention and quality of life were noted in 85% of both Group 1 and 2 patients. Rupture of the secondary bilateral synchrony was noted in 85% of Group 1 patients; there was no EEG modification after VNS in Group 2. Both procedures were effective regarding the control of atypical absences and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Both procedures were not effective in controlling tonic seizures. Callosotomy was very effective in reducing the frequency of atonic seizures, but VNS was ineffective. In contrast, callosotomy was not effective in reducing myoclonic seizures, whereas VNS was. Callosotomy might be preferred as the primary treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and no specific findings on MRI if atonic seizures prevail in the patient's clinical picture; when myoclonic seizures prevail, the same might hold true in favour of VNS. When atypical absence or generalised tonic-clonic seizures are the main concern, although both procedures carry similar effectiveness, VNS might be considered a good option as an initial approach, taking into account the adverse event profile. Patients should be advised that both procedures are not very effective in the treatment of tonic seizures.

High response rates in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (30.0%) and epilepsy with spasms/tonic seizures (38.5%) were sustained throughout the six-month study. The accuracy of, and differences between, responder rates should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients.

Eighty-eight percent of parents reported improvement in behavioral functioning. Shorter duration of epilepsy prior to surgery was a significant predictor of surgical outcome. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptomatic to hypothalamic hamartomas have better postsurgical outcome due to other etiologies compared with cryptogenic and symptomatic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients.

Of the 19 patients with West syndrome, respective surgery was performed in 15 patients (78.9%) and CC in 4 (21.1%). Of the patients receiving respective surgery, Engel's class I outcomes were achieved for 24 of 39 (61.5%) of LGS patients, and for 9 of 15 (60.0%) of West syndrome. Malformations of cortical development were commonly observed, appearing in 73.5% (36/49). In neuropsychiatric tests, 19 of 27 with LGS demonstrated improvement in postoperative cognitive function. More significant intellectual improvement correlated well with shorter epilepsy duration, good seizure outcomes, and decreased number of antiepileptic drugs. epilepsy surgery should be considered in treating childhood intractable EE with expectation of improvement of both seizure and cognitive outcomes, even in cases of LGS.

"	"To use EEG-fMRI to determine which structures are critically involved in the generation of paroxysmal fast activity (PFA) and slow spike and wave (SSW) (1.5-2.5 Hz), the characteristic interictal discharges of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We studied 13 well-characterized patients with LGS using structural imaging and EEG-fMRI at 3 tesla. Ten patients had cortical structural abnormalities. PFA and SSW were considered as separate events in the fMRI analysis. Simultaneous with fMRI, PFA was recorded in 6 patients and SSW in 9 (in 2, both were recorded). PFA events showed almost uniform increases in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in ""association"" cortical areas, as well as brainstem, basal ganglia, and thalamus. SSW showed a different pattern of BOLD signal change with many areas of decreased BOLD signal, mostly in primary cortical areas. Two patients with prior callosotomy had lateralized as well as generalized PFA. The lateralized PFA was associated with a hemispheric version of the PFA pattern we report here. PFA is associated with activity in a diffuse network that includes association cortices as well as an unusual pattern of simultaneous activation of subcortical structures (brainstem, thalamus, and basal ganglia). By comparison, the SSW pattern is quite different, with cortical and subcortical activations and deactivations. Regardless of etiology, it appears that 2 key, but distinct, patterns of diffuse brain network involvement contribute to the defining electrophysiologic features of LGS.

"	"Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

Clinical data were used to estimate baseline frequency and the percentage of drop-seizure reductions over 3 months (all comparators) and 2 years (rufinamide). Claims data from a large US health care plan were employed to estimate costs. After 3 months, 21.5% of those receiving clobazam were drop-seizure-free. Over a 3-month horizon, clobazam was more effective and less expensive than comparators, with the assumption that >0.77% of drop seizures required medical care. Below this threshold, topiramate was less costly than clobazam. With the base-case assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures were medically attended, costs for patients receiving clobazam totaled $30,147 versus $34,223-$35,378 for comparators. Clobazam was more efficacious and less costly than rufinamide over a 2-year horizon. The percentage of medically attended drop seizures was a driver of results. Clobazam treatment may be cost-saving.

"	"Polymicrogyria is caused by a diverse etiology, one of which is gene mutation. At present, only one gene (GPR56) is known to cause polymicrogyria, which leads to a distinctive phenotype termed bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is an autosomal recessive inherited human brain malformation with abnormal cortical lamination. Here, we identified compound heterozygous GPR56 mutations in a patient with BFPP. The proband was a Japanese female born from non-consanguineous parents. She presented with mental retardation, developmental motor delay, epilepsy exhibiting the feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, exotropia, bilateral polymicrogyria with a relatively spared perisylvian region, bilateral patchy-white-matter MRI signal changes, and hypoplastic pontine basis. GPR56 sequence analysis revealed a c.107G>A substitution leading to a p.S36N, and a c.113G>A leading to a p.R38Q. Although affected individuals with compound heterozygosity in GPR56 have not been previously described, we presume that compound heterozygosity of these two mutations in a ligand binding domain within the extracellular N-terminus of protein could result in BFPP. In addition, we observed unusually less involvement of perisylvian cortex for polymicrogyria, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for epilepsy, which are likely common features in patients with BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) uncovered two heterozygous mutations in NDUFV2 gene that were reassigned to a pseudogene. With the WES data, it was possible to obtain whole mitochondrial DNA sequencing and to identify a heteroplasmic variant in the MT-ND1 (MTND1) gene (m.3946G>A, p.E214K). The expression of the gene in patient fibroblasts was not affected but the protein level was significantly reduced, suggesting that protein stability was affected by this mutation. The lower protein level also affected assembly of complex I and supercomplexes (I/III2 /IV and I/III2 ), leading to complex I deficiency. While ATP levels at steady state under stress conditions were not affected, the amount of ROS produced by complex I was significantly increased.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic disorder with characteristic electroclinical features but diverse etiologies. The shared electroclinical characteristics suggest that common cerebral networks are involved in generating seizures. We sought to reveal these networks by comparing ictal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We identified 10 ictal-interictal SPECT pairs from seven patients with LGS (median age 11 years; range 1-38) who were studied during video electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed tonic seizures. We performed a voxel-wise comparison of ictal and interictal SPECT studies across the group. The evolution of blood flow changes was explored by examining early and late injection groups. Median duration of tonic seizures was 10 s (range 6-29 s), and injection latency from seizure offset was -8 to 48 s. In the early injection group (<10 s; three studies), there was hyperperfusion over pons and cerebellar hemispheres (p < 0.05 cluster corrected family wise error), and hypoperfusion bilaterally over the pericentral region, with a trend toward hyperperfusion over bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri, and lateral parietal cortex. In the late injection group, there was hyperperfusion over midline and lateral cerebellar regions, with hypoperfusion widely over bilateral frontal regions. This study suggests that the tonic seizures of LGS result from activity in a network, containing bilateral frontal and parietal association areas and the pons. We postulate that tonic seizures recruit the corticoreticular system, which connects frontal attentional areas to the pontine reticular formation, and is normally responsible for postural tone and orienting behavior.

"	"Recently, epilepsy with late-onset epileptic spasms (ES) has been reported to be distinct from West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We identified the characteristics of this clinical entity by analyzing clinical data, including ictal electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in symptomatic patients. We evaluated retrospectively eight symptomatic patients with epilepsy with late-onset ES. All patients underwent video-EEG analysis for more than 24 hours and have been followed up for at least 1 year. Interictal EEG, ictal EEG, ictal EMG, coexistence seizures, response to treatment, and intellectual or daily activity level were assessed. Ictal EMG was evaluated by spectral analysis. All patients exhibited neurological deterioration and had multiple seizure types; seven of them had intractable seizures. Interictal EEG showed no typical hypsarrhythmia in any case. Ictal EMG analysis revealed that the predominant seizure types presenting with the tonic component were distributed among ES, spasms followed by tonic seizures (SFT), and tonic seizures. The clinical characteristics of our patients were identical to infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. Our patients had ES, SFT, and tonic seizures as the core seizure types, developed ES beyond the age of 1 year, and showed neurological deterioration. These may be essential symptoms of this clinical entity.

"	"Severe childhood epilepsies are characterized by frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delays, and impaired quality of life. In these treatment-resistant epilepsies, families often seek alternative treatments. This survey explored the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis in children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. The survey was presented to parents belonging to a Facebook group dedicated to sharing information about the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to treat their child's seizures. Nineteen responses met the following inclusion criteria for the study: a diagnosis of epilepsy and current use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. Thirteen children had Dravet syndrome, four had Doose syndrome, and one each had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and idiopathic epilepsy. The average number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) tried before using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis was 12. Sixteen (84%) of the 19 parents reported a reduction in their child's seizure frequency while taking cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. Of these, two (11%) reported complete seizure freedom, eight (42%) reported a greater than 80% reduction in seizure frequency, and six (32%) reported a 25-60% seizure reduction. Other beneficial effects included increased alertness, better mood, and improved sleep. Side effects included drowsiness and fatigue. Our survey shows that parents are using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis as a treatment for their children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Because of the increasing number of states that allow access to medical cannabis, its use will likely be a growing concern for the epilepsy community. Safety and tolerability data for cannabidiol-enriched cannabis use among children are not available. Objective measurements of a standardized preparation of pure cannabidiol are needed to determine whether it is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious at controlling seizures in this pediatric population with difficult-to-treat seizures.

VNS is associated with a significant improvement in standard mood scales in 31 adults with epilepsy (2 Class III studies). Infection risk at the VNS implantation site in children is increased relative to that in adults (odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.0-11.2). VNS is possibly effective for seizures (both partial and generalized) in children, for LGS-associated seizures, and for mood problems in adults with epilepsy. VNS may have improved efficacy over time. VNS may be considered for seizures in children, for LGS-associated seizures, and for improving mood in adults with epilepsy (Level C).

At our tertiary referral epilepsy center, a couple of difficult-to-treat patients were awaiting this introduction of PER; therefore, we were able to initiate treatment in many patients within a short period of time. For this report we collected and analyzed the data of the first patients who had been started on add-on PER between September and December of 2012, so that we were able to evaluate at least 6 months of treatment when we made this analysis. At cutoff in June of 2013, 74 patients could be analyzed. Mean age was 38.4 years (range 15-71 years). PER doses ranged from 4 to 14 mg (mean 8.8 mg). All patients took PER once daily at bedtime. Seventy-one patients had focal epileptic seizures; the remaining four patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Considering the last 3 months of observation compared with baseline, 34 patients (46%) were responders with a reduction of seizure frequency of at least 50%.

"	"Traditionally, identification of epileptogenic zones primarily relied on visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings by experienced epileptologists; however, removal of epileptogenic zones identified by iEEG does not always guarantee favorable surgical outcomes. To confirm visual inspection results, and assist in making decisions about surgical resection areas, computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been used for the localization of epileptogenic zones. In this study, we have proposed a new approach for the localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and have investigated whether the proposed approach could confirm surgical resection areas and predict seizure outcome before surgery. The proposed approach simultaneously used results of 2 iEEG analysis methods, directed transfer function (DTF) and time delay estimation, to enhance localization accuracy. This new combined method was applied to patients who became seizure-free after resective epilepsy surgery, as well as those who had unsuccessful surgery. A quantitative metric was also introduced that can measure how well the localized epileptogenic zones coincided with the surgical resection areas, with the aim of verifying whether the approach could confirm surgical resection areas determined by epileptologists. The estimated epileptogenic zones more strongly coincided with surgical resection areas in patients with successful, compared to those with unsuccessful surgical outcomes. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that the combined use of 2 iEEG analyses resulted in a more accurate estimate of epileptogenic zones in LGS than the use of a single method. A combination of multiple iEEG analyses could not only enhance overall accuracy of localizing epileptogenic zones in LGS, but also has the potential to predict outcomes before resective surgery.

Eligible patients from two randomized controlled trials (Phase II OV-1002 and Phase III OV-1012) were able to enroll in open-label extension (OLE) study OV-1004 beginning in December 2005 and received clobazam until they discontinued (mandatory at 2 years for patients outside the United States) or until study completion in March 2012. Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6 years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting. Of 267 patients who enrolled in the OLE, 188 (70%) completed the trial. Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for >2 years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5 years, and 11 for 6 years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a ≥50% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure-free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure-free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were ""very much improved"" or ""much improved"" after 3 years. Of the 43 patients with concomitant AED data who were treated for 5 years, 30% increased, 19% decreased, and 51% had no change in numbers of AEDs versus their Week 4 regimens. The mean modal clobazam dosage was 0.90 mg/kg/day at Year 1 and 0.97 mg/kg/day at Year 5, suggesting that study patients did not need significant increases in dosage over time. The safety profile was what would be expected for clobazam for LGS patients over a 5-year span, and no new safety concerns developed over time. In this largest and longest-running trial in LGS, adjunctive clobazam sustained seizure freedom and substantial seizure improvements at stable dosages through 3 years of therapy in this difficult- to-treat patient population.

The Aim of our study was to evaluate the risk factors that influence cognitive outcome in patients with ABPE/PLS and CSWS in a retrospective analysis. Thirty patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ABPE/PLS and 12 for CSWS and were chosen for the descriptive analysis. Cognitive achievement was evaluated according to psychological tests and school performances. Severe global and specific cognitive disturbances occurred almost regularly in cases of ABPE. Already at the time of epilepsy presentation the level of cognitive performance was lower than that of the normal population. At the time of disease presentation only 56% of the children had IQ within the standard range (≥85). We observed that the level of cognitive developmental delay did not change significantly during the disease process. We were not able to observe any statistically significant connection between the development of EEG abnormalities and cognitive development. The conclusion can be drawn that many patients exhibit cognitive impairment at disease presentation which is not affected significantly during the treatment process. Judging from the observed data, we assume that EEG abnormalities, duration of active epilepsy, and antiepileptic medication have less influence on the cognitive development than was previously assumed.

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of CHD2 in LGS, as CHD2 mutations have been described recently in various epileptic encephalopathies. We have previously identified one patient with a large deletion affecting the CHD2 gene in a group of 22 patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. In the remaining 17 patients without known etiology, Sanger sequencing revealed a de novo 1-bp duplication in the CHD2 gene in another patient. This mutation leads to a frameshift and, consequently, a premature stop codon 49bp downstream of the mutation. The patient had prominent myoclonic seizures and photosensitivity, thus, sharing phenotypic features with previously reported patients with CHD2-related epilepsy. In our original material of 22 patients with LGS features, we have now found two (9%) with mutations in the CHD2 gene. Our findings suggest that CHD2 mutations are important in the etiological spectrum of LGS.

"	"Precise localization of epileptogenic zones is essential for the successful surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The surgical resection areas are generally determined by epileptologists based on diverse neuroimaging modalities; however, exact epileptogenic zones cannot be accurately localized in many patients with LGS using the conventional methods. Therefore, new reliable algorithms are still required for enhancing the success rate of the resective epilepsy surgery. In the present study, we introduce an approach to localize epileptogenic zones in LGS based on the graph theoretical analysis of ical intracranial EEG (iEEG). Four patients with LGS who became seizure-free after the resective epilepsy surgery were selected. Before the surgery, their epileptogenic zones were delineated using EEG, iEEG, and several conventional imaging modalities. Phase locking value (PLV) analysis was applied to construct functional connectivity networks during ictal events, and then several graph theoretical indices including betweenness centrality (BC) were evaluated for each iEEG sensor to find the primary hubs of the ictal epileptic network. The graph theoretical index values were then overlaid on 3D individual cortical surface. The iEEG channels with high BC values coincided well with the surgical resection areas. Among various graph theoretical measures such as local efficiency, participation coefficient, and eigenvector centrality, only BC showed fair correspondence with the surgical resection areas. The primary hubs in the ictal epileptic networks coincided well with areas of surgical resection in LGS patients with successful surgical outcomes. This observation warrants further studies to determine if the graph theoretical network analysis of ictal iEEG recordings can serve as a new auxiliary tool to localize epileptogenic zones in LGS.

Although accumulating evidence supports a working mechanism through voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels, we found that a clinically relevant rufinamide concentration inhibits human (h)Nav1.1 activation, a distinct working mechanism among anticonvulsants and a feature worth exploring for treating a growing number of debilitating disorders involving hNav1.1. Subsequent structure-activity relationship experiments with related N-benzyl triazole compounds on four brain hNav channel isoforms revealed a novel drug variant that (1) shifts hNav1.1 opening to more depolarized voltages without further alterations in the gating properties of hNav1.1, hNav1.2, hNav1.3, and hNav1.6; (2) increases the threshold to action potential initiation in hippocampal neurons; and (3) greatly reduces the frequency of seizures in three animal models. Altogether, our results provide novel molecular insights into the rational development of Nav channel-targeting molecules based on the unique rufinamide scaffold, an outcome that may be exploited to design drugs for treating disorders involving particular Nav channel isoforms while limiting adverse effects.

"	"We report a case with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who underwent staged total callosotomy with a favorable outcome. A 6-year-old boy began having myoclonic seizures at the age of 8 months and was diagnosed with LGS when he was 27 months old. Various antiepileptic drugs and a ketogenic diet failed to control his multiple types of seizures. At the age of 36 months, he underwent corpus callosotomy and achieved an immediate, post-operative seizure free state. However, 3 months later, various seizures relapsed and were refractory to additional vagus nerve stimulation. Remaining callosal fibers in the splenium noted on post-operative diffusion tensor imaging made us to perform a second operation, total callosotomy. The patient finally achieved a seizure-free state with electroencephalography (EEG) normalization noted after the staged total callosotomy.

24649460	"The efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in intractable pediatric epilepsy
"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) and its efficacy has been proven in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, there is a lack of data regarding the efficacy in pediatric intractable epilepsies other than LGS. The purpose of the study was to explore the efficacy and tolerability of RUF in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS. This retrospective observation study was conducted in Samsung medical center from August 2010 to September 2011. Thirty seven patients (27 males, 10 females, aged between 1.8 and 18.4 years), with refractory epilepsies or LGS were treated with RUF as an adjunctive drug. Efficacy was represented by the response rate and retention rate over the study period. Tolerability was measured as the number of patients who showed adverse effects. The overall response rate was 21.6% during the 12 months of the study period with 5.4% of seizure-free patients. The retention rate was 54% and ineffectiveness was the most common reason for discontinuation of RUF. The most common adverse effects were insomnia and somnolence. RUF may be considered to be an efficacious and safe AED for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS.

24649473	"Epilepsy surgery in pediatric intractable epilepsy with destructive encephalopathy
"	"The aim of the current study is to review the clinical features, surgery outcomes and parental satisfaction of children with destructive encephalopathy who underwent epilepsy surgery due to medically intractable seizures. 48 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery from October 2003 to August 2011 at Severance Children's Hospital have been reviewed. The survey was conducted for functional outcomes and parental satisfaction at least 1 year after the surgery. Epileptic encephalopathy including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms was more prevalent than symptomatic focal epilepsy. Hypoxic ischemic injury accounted for most of the underlying etiology of the destructive encephalpathy, followed by central nervous system infection and head trauma. 27 patients (56.3%) underwent resective surgery and 21 patients (43.7%) underwent palliative surgery. 16 patients (33.3%) achieved seizure free and 27 parents (87.5%) reported satisfaction with the outcome of their children's epilepsy surgery. In addition, 14 parents (77.8 %) whose children were not seizure free reported satisfaction with their children's improvement in cognitive and behavior issues. Epilepsy surgery in destructive encephalopathy was effective for controlling seizures. Parents reported satisfaction not only with the surgical outcomes, but also with improvement of cognitive and behavior issues.

"	"There is scanty data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the modified Atkins diet in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study was a retrospective review of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome treated with the modified Atkins diet from May 2009 and March 2011. The diet was initiated in those children who persisted to have daily seizures despite the use of at least 3 appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Twenty-five children were started on a modified Atkins diet, restricting carbohydrate intake to 10 g/d. After 3 months, 2 patients were seizure-free, and 10/25 children had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 6 months, of 11 patients on the diet, 3 were seizure free and 8 had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 1 year, all 9 children on diet had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The side effects of the diet were mild. The modified Atkins diet was found to be effective and well tolerated in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Mechanism of seizure refractoriness to antiepileptic drugs in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not known. Efflux of antiepileptic drugs due to increased expression/function of P-glycoprotein, a multidrug efflux transporter protein on the cell surface is a proposed mechanism. The authors studied the expression/function of P-glycoprotein on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 29 children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 23 children with other epilepsies, and 19 healthy children. The authors found a higher P-glycoprotein expression/function in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a higher percent positive cells as compared to children with other epilepsy (P < 0.001) and to healthy controls (P = 0.012), higher P-glycoprotein expression as compared to healthy controls (P = 0.003), a higher total P-glycoprotein expression (relative florescence intensity × percent positive cells) as compared to children with other epilepsies (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.001), and a higher P-glycoprotein function as compared to children with other epilepsies (P = 0.001) and healthy controls (P = 0.002). These findings may explain seizure refractoriness to anti-epileptic drugs in Lennox-Gastaut syndome.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epilepsy phenotype with characteristic electroclinical features despite diverse etiologies. We previously found common cerebral networks involved during slow spike-and-wave (SSW) and generalized paroxysmal fast activity (PFA), characteristic interictal discharges. Some patients have a Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype and cortical lesions. We wished to explore the interaction between cerebral networks and lesions in this group. 3 Tesla electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) on six subjects with Lennox-Gastaut phenotype and a structural lesion. Timings of SSW and PFA events were used in an event-related fMRI analysis, and to estimate the time course of the hemodynamic response from key regions. (1) PFA-robust fMRI signal increases were observed in frontal and parietal association cortical areas, thalamus, and pons, with simultaneous increases in both ""attention"" and resting-state (default mode) networks, a highly unusual pattern. (2) SSW showed mixed increased and decreased fMRI activity, with preevent increases in association cortex and thalamus, and then prominent postevent reduction. There was decreased fMRI activity in primary cortical areas. (3) Lesion-variable fMRI increases were observed during PFA and SSW discharges. Three subjects who proceeded to lesionectomy are >1 year seizure-free. We conceptualize Lennox-Gastaut phenotype as a being a network epilepsy, where key cerebral networks become autonomously unstable. Epileptiform activity in Lennox-Gastaut phenotype, and by implication in LGS, appears to be amplified and expressed through association cortical areas, possibly because the attention and default-mode networks are widely interconnected, fundamental brain networks. Seizure freedom in the subjects who proceeded to lesionectomy suggests that cortical lesions are able to establish and maintain this abnormal unstable network behavior. LGS may be considered a secondary network epilepsy because the unifying epileptic manifestations of the disorder, including PFA and SSW, reflect network dysfunction, rather than the specific initiating process.

"	"Despite the introduction of multiple new antiepileptic drugs in the past two decades, many patients with epilepsy continue to experience uncontrolled seizures or significant side effects. To present our experience with felbamate therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and video-EEG recordings of all patients receiving felbamate until May 2012. Efficacy was determined according to seizure frequency during the week prior to treatment initiation and the week after the maximal dosage of felbamate was reached. Fifty patients (34 boys) aged 4 months to 17 years (mean--5.5 years) were identified. Nearly third of the patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Mean epilepsy duration was 3.4 years (range--1 month to 13 years). The mean number of previous antiepileptic drugs was 7.5. The mean duration of follow-up was 1.1 years. Seizure frequency decreased by at least 50% in 29 (58%) patients. Side effects were reported in 22 (44%) patients, none of them included aplastic anemia or liver failure. In the responder group, the maximal dose of felbamate was lower and the patients were older compared to non-responders. Despite current recommendations, felbamate is initiated following multiple AEDs. Based on its efficacy and safety data, earlier initiation of felbamate is recommended in children with refractory epilepsy.

"	"To compare outcomes of anterior corpus callosotomy (CCT) with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) treatment in school-aged children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Sixty school-aged children with LGS were prospectively enrolled and divided into either the medicine or surgery group according the choice of the patients' caregivers. Cases in the medicine group were treated with multiple rational AEDs and patients in the surgery group underwent anterior CCT. Seizure control at 1-5 years after enrollment and changes of intelligence quotient (IQ) and quality of life (QOL) from pre-treatment to the 2-year follow-up were compared between the two groups. The percentages of patients who were totally seizure-free in the surgery group were 17.4% at the 1-year follow-up, 13.0% at the 2-year follow-up and 8.7% at the 5-year follow up, and the data for patients in the medicine group were 2.9%, 5.9% and 2.9%, respectively. Significant differences were found in total seizure control between the two groups at 1, 2, and 5-year follow-up (personal χ2 test). Significant differences were found in mean changes of IQ and overall QOL between the medicine and surgery groups at the 2-year follow-up, showing positive results for the surgery group, but these changes were not related to postoperative outcomes of seizure control (t-test). Anterior CCT is a promising treatment for school-aged children with LGS, and can present marked seizure control and improvement in QOL and IQ, all of which were significantly better than the effects of treatment with multiple AEDs.

"	"The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as an alternative to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for patients with refractory epilepsy. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) belongs to the group of epileptic encephalopathies that often prove refractory to AED treatment. In this prospective study we assess the efficacy and tolerability of the KD in patients with LGS. Between March 1, 1990 and April 1, 2013, 61 patients who met diagnostic criteria of LGS were seen at our department. Twenty of them were placed on the KD and followed for a minimum of 16 months. The children had previously received a mean of 6.5 different AEDs and were on a mean of 2.5 AEDs when the diet was started. Eighteen months after initiating the diet, fifteen of the initial patients (75%) remained on the diet; three patients (15%) were seizure free, three (15%) had a 75-99% decrease in seizures, two (10%) had a 50-74% decrease in seizures, and the remaining seven children (35%) had a <50% decrease in seizures. Three seizure-free patients were tapered off the diet after remaining seizure free. In the three patients who had a 75-99% decrease in seizures AEDs were reduced. The KD is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with LGS, not only for those with cryptogenic, but also for those with structural LGS. The diet should be considered early in the course of this syndrome.

Rufinamide is a new antiepileptic drug approved for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and it is also effective for refractory partial seizures. We report 3 cases of pediatric patients aged 7.2, 8.1, and 10.1 years, respectively, with intractable epilepsy associated with bilateral open-lip schizencephaly and septo-optic dysplasia. The follow-up ranged from 3.8 to 4.1 years. In our patients, the introduction of rufinamide as adjunctive drug led to a dramatic decline in the number of seizures and an improvement in EEG epileptic activity without side effects. Rufinamide seems to be efficacious and safe in patients with epileptic encephalopathies associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy; further and larger clinical reports and controlled studies could confirm the usefulness of this anticonvulsant drug.

"	"To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We conducted a multicenter clinical trial with a 4-week baseline, a 2-week titration, a 10-week maintenance, and either a follow-up visit or entry into an open-label extension. Patients with LGS (4 to 30 years old) taking between one and three antiepileptic drugs were recruited. After the baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to rufinamide or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days. Of the 59 patients, 29 were randomized to the rufinamide group and 30 to the placebo group. The frequency of epileptic seizures was significantly decreased in the rufinamide group than in the placebo group; the median percent change in frequency of tonic-atonic seizures was -24.2% and -3.3%, respectively, (p=0.003) and that of total seizures was -32.9% and -3.1%, respectively (p<0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of rufinamide was consistent independent of clinical background characteristics. The common treatment-related adverse events in the rufinamide group were decreased appetite (17.2%), somnolence (17.2%), and vomiting (13.8%). Transient seizure aggravations were observed in 13 (22.0%) of the 59 patients, though a causal relationship with rufinamide was suspected in only one patient. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The mean plasma concentration of rufinamide between 1 and 9 within 12h after administration was 17.2 μg/mL. The present results showed a favorable risk-benefit profile for rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for patients with LGS.

"	"Emerging evidence indicates that epileptic encephalopathies are genetically highly heterogeneous, underscoring the need for large cohorts of well-characterized individuals to further define the genetic landscape. Through a collaboration between two consortia (EuroEPINOMICS and Epi4K/EPGP), we analyzed exome-sequencing data of 356 trios with the ""classical"" epileptic encephalopathies, infantile spasms and Lennox Gastaut syndrome, including 264 trios previously analyzed by the Epi4K/EPGP consortium. In this expanded cohort, we find 429 de novo mutations, including de novo mutations in DNM1 in five individuals and de novo mutations in GABBR2, FASN, and RYR3 in two individuals each. Unlike previous studies, this cohort is sufficiently large to show a significant excess of de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy probands compared to the general population using a likelihood analysis (p = 8.2 × 10(-4)), supporting a prominent role for de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies. We bring statistical evidence that mutations in DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathy, find suggestive evidence for a role of three additional genes, and show that at least 12% of analyzed individuals have an identifiable causal de novo mutation. Strikingly, 75% of mutations in these probands are predicted to disrupt a protein involved in regulating synaptic transmission, and there is a significant enrichment of de novo mutations in genes in this pathway in the entire cohort as well. These findings emphasize an important role for synaptic dysregulation in epileptic encephalopathies, above and beyond that caused by ion channel dysfunction.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy of childhood with a heterogeneous etiology. Recently, genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of new de novo mutations associated with this epileptic syndrome. Herein, we report an 8-year-old child with intellectual disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, Rett-like features, and LGS, carrying a de novo missense mutation in the forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene. This gene is responsible for FOXG1 syndrome, characterized by severe postnatal microcephaly, moderate postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation with poor social interaction, stereotyped behavior and dyskinesias, absent language, sleep disorders, and epilepsy. Nonspecific epilepsy syndromes have been associated with this genetic disorder. Thus, we hypothesize that FOXG1 might be a new candidate gene in the etiology of LGS and suggest screening for this gene in cases of LGS with concomitant microcephaly and clinical features overlapping with Rett syndrome.

The study was an open-label, multicenter, observational clinical trial of levetiracetam as an add-on treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Fifty-five patients aged 1.1-18.6 years (mean, 10.0 years) were enrolled. The study included a 4-8-week titration period and an 8-week maintenance period. The maintenance dose of levetiracetam was 20-80 mg/kg/day, according to its effectiveness and tolerability. The primary end point was reduction in seizure frequency, and related variables were also evaluated. Among 55 patents, 51 patients (92.7%) completed the study. Thirty-two patients (58.2%) experienced a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 15 patients (27.3%) became seizure free. A reduction in seizure frequency of more than 50% was observed in 21 of 36 patients (58.3%) with convulsive seizures, 7 of 12 patients (58.3%) with drop attacks, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with myoclonic seizures, and 2 of 3 patients (66.7%) with epileptic spasms. Overall, 34.5% of patients reported adverse events. None of the adverse events were life threatening, and the most common adverse event was hyperactivity (12.7%). This study suggests that levetiracetam is a safe and effective treatment in pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) severity varies considerably, so the potential impact of differences in baseline severity on patient outcome following treatment is clinically informative. Here, two surrogate indicators of LGS severity (baseline seizure frequency and vagus nerve stimulation [VNS] use) were used in post hoc analyses of both short- and long-term clobazam trials (Phase III OV-1012 [CONTAIN] and open-label extension [OLE] OV-1004). In CONTAIN, 217 patients comprised the modified, intention-to-treat population. Each baseline seizure-frequency quartile had ~40 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure frequency ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-30 (Quartile 2), 32-86 (Quartile 3), and 86-1077 (Quartile 4). Mean percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar for all quartiles. More than 50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly drop- and total-seizure frequency. The percentage of patients achieving 100% reduction in drop seizures was 33% for clobazam-treated patients (vs. 7% for placebo) in Quartile 1. Five percent of clobazam-treated patients in Quartile 4 (most severe LGS) vs. 0% for placebo achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures. A total of 267 of 306 possible patients entered the OLE (61/68 from a Phase II study and 206/238 from Phase III CONTAIN). Each quartile had ~66 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-31 (Quartile 2), 32-110 (Quartile 3), and 111-1147 (Quartile 4). Median percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar between quartiles. Through 5 years of therapy, >50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly frequency for drop seizures. More than 12% of patients in Quartile 4 achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures from Month 3 through Year 5. For the VNS analyses in CONTAIN, the least-squares mean decreases in average weekly rate of drop seizures (mITT population) were 52% for VNS patients receiving clobazam vs. -22% for placebo (p < 0.01). For non-VNS patients, these percentages were 53% for clobazam and 26% for placebo (p < 0.01). Moreover, 50% and 54% of clobazam-treated patients in the VNS and non-VNS groups demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in average weekly drop- and total-seizure frequencies, and 11% and 14% in the two groups achieved drop-seizure freedom, respectively. Analyses using baseline seizure frequency and VNS use as surrogates for disease severity showed that clobazam treatment of patients with less severe or severe LGS was equally efficacious.

25511520	"Clinical considerations in transitioning patients with epilepsy from clonazepam to clobazam: a case series
"	"In treating refractory epilepsy, many clinicians are interested in methods used to transition patients receiving clonazepam to clobazam to maintain or increase seizure control, improve tolerability of patients' overall drug therapy regimens, and to enhance quality of life for patients and their families. However, no published guidelines assist clinicians in successfully accomplishing this change safely. The following three case reports provide insight into the transition from clonazepam to clobazam. First, an 8-year-old Caucasian boy with cryptogenic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome beginning at 3.5 years of age, who was experiencing multiple daily generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and tonic seizures at presentation. Second, a 25-year-old, left-handed, White Hispanic man with moderate mental retardation and medically refractory seizures that he began experiencing at 1 year of age, secondary to tuberous sclerosis. When first presented to an epilepsy center, he had been receiving levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam, but reported having ongoing and frequent seizures. Third, a 69-year-old Korean woman who had been healthy until she had a stroke in 2009 with subsequent right hemiparesis; as a result, she became less physically and socially active, and had her first convulsive seizure approximately 4 months after the stroke. From these cases, we observe that a rough estimate of final clobazam dosage for each mg of clonazepam under substitution is likely to be at least 10-fold, probably closer to 15-fold for many patients, and as high as 20-fold for a few. Consideration and discussion of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and clinical properties of 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepine action provide a rationale on why and how these transitions were successful.

"	"Rufinamide is a third-generation antiepileptic drug, approved recently as an orphan drug for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although extensive research was conducted, its pharmacokinetics in rats was not described. This work addresses that area by describing in a rapid pharmacokinetic study the main pharmacokinetic properties of rufinamide at three different doses of 1 mg/kg body weight (bw), 5 mg/kg bw, and 20 mg/kg bw. Furthermore, total brain concentrations of the drug were determined in order to characterize its brain-to-plasma partition coefficient. Adult Wistar male rats, weighing 200-450 g, were administered rufinamide by intravenous and oral routes. Rufinamide concentrations from plasma samples and brain tissue homogenate were determined using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric method and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The mean half-life was between 7 and 13 h, depending on route of administration--intravenously administered drug was eliminated faster than orally administered drug. Mean (S.E.M.) total plasma clearance was 84.01 ± 3.80 ml/h/kg for intravenous administration, while the apparent plasma clearance for oral administration was 95.52 ± 39.45 ml/h/kg. The mean (S.E.M.) maximum plasma concentration reached after oral administration of 1 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw was 0.89 ± 0.09 μg/ml and 3.188 ± 0.71 μg/ml, respectively. The median (range) time to reach maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) was 4 (2-8)h. Mean (S.E.M.) brain-to-plasma concentration ratio of rufinamide was 0.514 ± 0.036, consistent with the brain-to-plasma ratio calculated from the area under curves (AUC(0-t)) of 0.441 ± 0.047. No influence of dose, route of administration, or post-dosing time was observed on brain-to-plasma ratio.

Here, we report a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who developed agranulocytosis associated with fever and skin rash with rufinamide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of agranulocytosis induced by rufinamide. A 10-year-old boy with a history of herpes encephalitis at the age of 1 year developed LGS, and was administered rufinamide as add-on therapy to valproate, lamotrigine, and clonazepam because of difficulties in controlling tonic seizures. Eighteen days after initiation of rufinamide, agranulocytosis developed associated with high fever and skin rash, all of which resolved after withdrawal of rufinamide. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normocellular marrow with selective decrease of mature myeloid series, and suggested that agranulocytosis was not related to malignancy or serious infection. This case suggests that rufinamide may induce the potentially serious adverse effect of agranulocytosis. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs of agranulocytosis and consideration should be given to routine blood count determination for early detection of this.

This nonsponsored, observational, retrospective survey was conducted through collaboration with multiple centers in Europe. The clinical course of the first pediatric patients treated in these centers with PER was documented with the help of a questionnaire completed by the treating physicians. Effectiveness and adverse effects were evaluated. The study population consisted of 58 patients (mean age, 10.5 years; range, 2-17 years), suffering from various refractory epilepsies, classified as focal epilepsy (n = 36), unclassified generalized epilepsy (n = 12), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 5), West syndrome (n = 3), and Dravet syndrome (n = 2). The response rate (≥ 50% seizure reduction) after the first 3 months of therapy was 31% (18/58 patients) in total. Complete seizure control was achieved in five patients (9% overall). Aggravation of seizures occurred in five cases (9%). The most frequently occurring adverse effects were reduced vigilance or fatigue (n = 16) and behavioral changes (n = 14). PER seems to be effective also in children and adolescents with pharmaco-refractory epilepsies. Tolerability was acceptable.

"	"Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the most frequently used antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of focal and generalized epilepsies, absence seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). VPA has been demonstrated to have a negative effect on both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation systems and controversy exists about the clinical relevance of such hematological abnormalities. We describe a case of reversible lung hemorrage due to VPA. In English-language literature only two other similar cases (one of which fatal) have been described so far.

25845492	"Parental reporting of response to oral cannabis extracts for treatment of refractory epilepsy
"	"Oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) have been used in the treatment of epilepsy; however, no studies demonstrate clear efficacy. We report on a cohort of pediatric patients with epilepsy who were given OCE and followed in a single tertiary epilepsy center. A retrospective chart review of children and adolescents who were given OCE for treatment of their epilepsy was performed. Seventy-five patients were identified of which 57% reported any improvement in seizure control and 33% reported a >50% reduction in seizures (responders). If the family had moved to CO for OCE treatment, the responder rate was 47% vs. 22% for children who already were in CO. The responder rate varied based on epilepsy syndrome: Dravet 23%, Doose 0%, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 88.9%. The background EEG of the 8 responders where EEG data were available was not improved. Additional benefits reported included: improved behavior/alertness (33%), improved language (10%), and improved motor skills (10%). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% of patients including increased seizures (13%) and somnolence/fatigue (12%). Rare adverse events included developmental regression, abnormal movements, status epilepticus requiring intubation, and death. Our retrospective study of OCE use in pediatric patients with epilepsy demonstrates that some families reported patient improvement with treatment; however, we also found a variety of challenges and possible confounding factors in studying OCE retrospectively in an open-labeled fashion. We strongly support the need for controlled, blinded studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCE for treatment of pediatric epilepsies using accurate seizure counts, formal neurocognitive assessments, as well as EEG as a biomarker. This study provides Class III evidence that OCE is well tolerated by children and adolescents with epilepsy.

"	"To evaluate the effectiveness of rufinamide (RFM) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) compared to those with other epilepsy syndromes using time to treatment failure (retention rate) as the outcome measure. In this retrospective cohort study, characteristics and outcomes of all patients receiving RFM in 2009 and 2010 were recorded. The primary outcome measure was RFM failure, defined as discontinuation of RFM or initiation of an additional antiepileptic therapy. The secondary outcome measure was discontinuation of RFM. Kaplan-Meier method survival curves were generated for time to RFM failure, for all patients and by the presence or absence of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The impact of age, seizure type, fast or slow drug titration, and concomitant therapy with valproate on retention rate were evaluated using Cox regression models. One hundred thirty-three patients were included, 39 (30%) of whom had LGS. For all patients, the probability of remaining on RFM without additional therapy was 45% at 12 months and 30% at 24 months. LGS diagnosis was an independent predictor of time to RFM failure (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.83), with a median time to failure of 18 months in LGS compared to 6 months in all others (p=0.006). In a broad population of children with refractory epilepsy, around half will continue taking the medication for at least a year without additional therapy. Patients with LGS are two times more likely to continue RFM without additional therapy compared to those without LGS.

25890840	"Epileptic activity during early postnatal life in the AY-9944 model of atypical absence epilepsy
"	"Atypical absence epilepsy (AAE) is an intractable disorder characterized by slow spike-and-wave discharges in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and accompanied by severe cognitive dysfunction and neurodevelopmental or neurological deficits in humans. Administration of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor AY-9944 (AY) during the postnatal developmental period induces AAE in animals; however, the neural mechanism of seizure development remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the cellular manifestations of AY-induced AAE in the mouse. Treatment of brain slices with AY increased membrane excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons. AY treatment also increased input resistance of CA1 neurons during early postnatal days (PND) 5-10. However, these effects were not observed during late PND (14-21) or in adulthood (7-10 weeks). Notably, AY treatment elicited paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS)-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period, but not during late PND or in adults. The PDS-like events were not compromised by application of glutamate or GABA receptor antagonists. However, the PDS-like events were abolished by blockage of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Hippocampal neurons isolated from an in vivo AY model of AAE showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. Further, AY-treated neurons from T-type Ca(2+) channel α1G knockout (Cav3.1(-/-)) mice, which do not exhibit typical absence seizures, showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. These results demonstrate that PDS-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period are dependent upon Na(+) channels and are involved in the generation of AY-induced AAE, which is distinct from typical absence epilepsy. Our findings may aid our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of clinical AAE in individuals, such as those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

25935511	"Perceived efficacy of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis extracts for treatment of pediatric epilepsy: A potential role for infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"There is a great need for safe and effective therapies for treatment of infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Based on anecdotal reports and limited experience in an open-label trial, cannabidiol (CBD) has received tremendous attention as a potential treatment for pediatric epilepsy, especially Dravet syndrome. However, there is scant evidence of specific utility for treatment of IS and LGS. We sought to document the experiences of children with IS and/or LGS who have been treated with CBD-enriched cannabis preparations. We conducted a brief online survey of parents who administered CBD-enriched cannabis preparations for the treatment of their children's epilepsy. We specifically recruited parents of children with IS and LGS and focused on perceived efficacy, dosage, and tolerability. Survey respondents included 117 parents of children with epilepsy (including 53 with IS or LGS) who had administered CBD products to their children. Perceived efficacy and tolerability were similar across etiologic subgroups. Eighty-five percent of all parents reported a reduction in seizure frequency, and 14% reported complete seizure freedom. Epilepsy was characterized as highly refractory with median latency from epilepsy onset to CBD initiation of five years, during which the patient's seizures failed to improve after a median of eight antiseizure medication trials. The median duration and the median dosage of CBD exposure were 6.8 months and 4.3mg/kg/day, respectively. Reported side effects were far less common during CBD exposure, with the exception of increased appetite (30%). A high proportion of respondents reported improvement in sleep (53%), alertness (71%), and mood (63%) during CBD therapy. Although this study suggests a potential role for CBD in the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy including IS and LGS, it does not represent compelling evidence of efficacy or safety. From a methodological standpoint, this study is extraordinarily vulnerable to participation bias and limited by lack of blinded outcome ascertainment. Appropriately controlled clinical trials are essential to establish efficacy and safety.

25940107	"Clobazam is equally safe and efficacious for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome across different age groups: Post hoc analyses of short- and long-term clinical trial results
"	"The peak age at onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is between 3 and 5years. Patients with LGS frequently experience multiple types of treatment-refractory seizures and require lifelong therapy with several antiepileptic drugs. Here, post hoc analyses of clinical trials (phase III trial OV-1012 and open-label extension trial OV-1004) provide short- and long-term efficacy and safety data of adjunctive clobazam in patients with LGS stratified by age at baseline (≥2 to <12years, ≥12 to <17years, and ≥17years). In OV-1012, 301 patients were screened, 238 were randomized, 217 comprised the modified intention-to-treat population, and 177 completed the study. A total of 267/306 patients (61 of 68 from phase II trial OV-1002 and 206 of 238 from phase III trial OV-1012) entered the open-label extension trial. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between different age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. No differences in efficacy or adverse events were observed across age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. The results of these post hoc analyses show that adjunctive clobazam over the short and longterm was similarly effective and well-tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients with LGS.

26036975	"Rufinamide Improves Functional and Behavioral Deficits via Blockade of Tetrodotoxin-Resistant Sodium Channels in Diabetic Neuropathy
"	"Rufinamide is a structurally novel, antiepileptic drug approved for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) with possible membrane-stabilizing effects. VGSCs play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we investigated the effects of rufinamide on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium current (TTX-R I(Na)) in acutely dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by using whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration. In addition, the functional and behavioural nociceptive parameters were evaluated to assess its potential in diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic rats demonstrated the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia with reduced nerve perfusion and conduction velocity as compared to control. Rufinamide treatments (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly improved these functional and nociceptive deficits. Diabetic rat DRG neurons exhibited increased TTX-R I(Na) density as compared to control. The voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation curves for TTX-R I(Na) in DRG neurons from diabetic rats were shifted negatively as compared to control. Rufinamide treatments significantly blocked the TTX-R Na+ channel activity as evident from significant reduction in I(Na) density and hyperpolarizing shift in activation and inactivation curves as compared to diabetic control. This suggests that rufinamide acts on TTX-R Na+ channels, reduces channel activity and attenuates nerve functional and behavioral parameters in diabetic rats. Altogether, these results indicate therapeutic potential of rufinamide in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

"	"Hormonal therapy or ketogenic diet often permits overcoming the challenging periods of many epileptic encephalopathies (West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep), but relapse affects over 20% of patients. We report here a monocenter pilot series of 42 consecutive patients in whom we combined oral steroids with the ketogenic diet for corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent epileptic encephalopathy. We retrospectively evaluated the effect on seizure frequency, interictal spike activity, neuropsychological course, and steroid treatment course. Twenty-three patients had West syndrome (WS), 13 had encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep (CSWS), and six others had miscellaneous epileptic encephalopathies. All patients succeeded to reach 0.8 to 1.6g/l ketone bodies in the urine following the usual KD regimen. For at least 6 months, 14/42 responded to the addition of the ketogenic diet: 4/23 with WS, 8/13 with CSWS, and 2/6 with miscellaneous epileptic encephalopathies. The addition of the KD allowed withdrawing steroids in all responders. Among them, 10/15 had been patients with steroid-dependent epileptic encephalopathy and 4/27 patients with steroid-resistant epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, the ketogenic diet can be used successfully in combination with corticosteroids for epileptic encephalopathies. Patients presenting with steroid-dependent CSWS seem to be the best candidates.

26093133	"Hypokalemia in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"The Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy. Incidence: 1/1.000.000/year, prevalence: 15/100.000. LGS covers 5-10% of epileptic patients and 1-2% of childhood epilepsies. Also referred to as cryptogenic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy. LGS is characterized by: multiple seizures (atypical absences, axial tonic seizures and sudden atonic or myoclonic falls), diffuse slow cryptic EEG waves when awake (<3 Hz), fast rhythmic peaks (10 Hz) during sleep, mental retardation and personality disorders. The LGS is not responding to treatment. Some new drugs have proven to be effective in controlling the disease (Felbamate, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Levetiracetam). The mortality rate is about 5%; only rarely death is due to epilepsy, which is usually caused by stroke or epileptic episodes. Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old female patient with LGS, severe hypokalemia, mental retardation and focal seizures. Normal renal function: creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 96 ml/min, serum potassium levels to the minimum: 3.5 mEq/L. This level of potassium, however, had been achieved with the assumption of 8 oral tablets/day of potassium chloride. Osmotic diuresis, use of diuretics, Bartter, Gitelman (normal urinary calcium and magnesium) and pseudo-Bartter syndromes were all excluded whereas aldosteronism was found. Our findings lead to hypokalemia related to assumption of topiramate and hyperaldosteronism. Reduction in drug intake was not effective due to the increased seizures, so the drug was maintained, along with potassium supplementation. In conclusion, the patient has been diagnosed with hypokalemia and iatrogenic hyperaldosteronism, rare in our outpatient practice.

"	"About one-half of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have history of birth hypoxia or other perinatal event but the knowledge about clinical, radiological profile and severity of epilepsy in these children as compared to those without a perinatal event is not known. Thirty-one children with LGS were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups: One group with the perinatal event and other group without evidence of the perinatal event. We hypothesized that LGS with the perinatal event will have an early age of onset of LGS, more motor deficits and abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and more severe epilepsy. There were 17 children in the perinatal event group and 14 in the other group. The mean age of onset of illness was significantly earlier in the perinatal event group (P < 0.05). More children in the perinatal event group had delayed milestones (P < 0.05), had higher seizure frequency (P < 0.05) however; there was no significant difference in number of anti-epileptic drugs consumed, motor deficits or MRI abnormalities. LGS children with the perinatal event have more severe epilepsy with early onset of disease and delayed milestones. History of perinatal insult in these children may help in predicting prognosis in LGS.

"	"A metabolic mechanism-based characterization of antiepileptic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with clobazam in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) was performed using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) approach. To characterize potential DDIs with clobazam, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 153 patients with LGS in study OV-1012 (NCT00518713) and 18 healthy participants in bioavailability study OV-1017 were pooled. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were grouped based on their effects on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes responsible for the metabolism of clobazam and its metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB): CYP3A inducers (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), CYP2C19 inducers (valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), or CYP2C19 inhibitors (felbamate, oxcarbazepine). CYP3A4 inducers-which did not affect the oral clearance of clobazam-significantly increased the formation of N-CLB by 9.4%, while CYP2C19 inducers significantly increased the apparent elimination rate of N-CLB by 10.5%, resulting in a negligible net change in the PK of the active metabolite. CYP2C19 inhibitors did not affect N-CLB elimination. Because concomitant use of AEDs that are either CYP450 inhibitors or inducers with clobazam in the treatment of LGS patients had negligible to no effect on clobazam PK in this study, dosage adjustments may not be required for clobazam in the presence of the AEDs investigated here.

26245776	"Clobazam and Aggression-Related Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is an intractable epileptic encephalopathy marked by frequent drop seizures. Most patients develop moderate intellectual disability and behavioral problems, including hyperactivity, aggressiveness, insecurity, and autistic features. Treatment with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may increase aggression/behavioral problems in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Post hoc analyses of data from the OV-1012 trial assessed the potential for behavioral effects with clobazam treatment in pediatric (2 to 18 years) patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. OV-1012 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial comprising a 4-week baseline period, 3-week titration period, and a 12-week maintenance period. Data from 194 patients were analyzed for a history of aggression/behavioral problems, occurrence of aggression-related adverse events, and by assessment of potential drug-related effects on four behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist. Twenty-nine aggression-related adverse events were reported for 27 (13.9%) patients. Similar percentages of clobazam-treated patients with and without a history of aggressive behavior experienced an aggression-related adverse event (16.7% versus 15.5%, respectively). In the medium- and high-dosage clobazam groups, onset of aggression-related adverse effects occurred within the 3-week titration period with 63.2% resolving by the end of the study. Aggression-related adverse event onset and resolution were similar for the low-dosage clobazam and placebo groups. Analysis of baseline to postbaseline T scores for the behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist indicated no significant differences between clobazam and placebo. Post hoc analyses indicate that the overall rate of aggression with clobazam treatment was low and dosage dependent. Clobazam treatment was effective in reducing drop seizures regardless of aggression experience.

All underwent a complete workup (including magnetic resonance imaging). Patients (n = 16, mean age 11.4 ± 6.4 years, range 6-19 years) had a mean seizure frequency of 24.5 ± 19.8/days (range 1-60) and a mean intelligence quotient of 25.23 ± 10.71. All had syndromic diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with the following etiologies: hypoxic insult (10), lissencephaly (2), bilateral band heterotropia (2), and microgyria and pachygyria (2). Surgery included complete callosotomy and the section of anterior and posterior commissure by microscopic approach through a mini craniotomy (11) and endoscopic-assisted approach (5). Complications included meningitis (1), hyperammonemic encephalopathy (2), and acute transient disconnection (5). There was no mortality or long-term morbidity.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can be successfully treated by resective surgery in patients with a primary epileptogenic zone. This study aimed to identify the primary epileptogenic zone based on the causal epileptic network using direct directed transfer function (dDTF) analysis. We reviewed the dDTF findings for generalized sharp and wave discharges (GSW) from the preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) of 12 LGS patients (group A) with unilateral focal pathology who were successfully treated with resective surgery. These findings were compared with preoperative dDTF findings for the GSW from 15 LGS patients with bilateral non-resectable pathology (group B) who exhibited persistent bilateral independent diffuse sharp and wave discharges, even after corpus callosotomy. The dDTF analysis of the GSW revealed concordant findings of localization or lateralization with the primary epileptogenic zone in 83.3% (10/12 cases) of group A patients and bilateral or multifocal localization in 93.3% (14/15) of group B patients (p<0.01). The regions identified by dDTF analysis were included in the resected areas of all patients in group A, and complete matches of the resected areas without other foci were observed in 7 patients (58.3%) in group A. The region of GSW most frequently identified by dDTF analysis was the frontal area, which was identified in 91.7% (11/12) of group A and in 100% of group B, while extra-frontal areas were identified in 36.1% and 24.5% of groups A and B, respectively. The dDTF analysis of GSW could provide additional information to identify resective surgery candidates for patients with LGS.

"	"To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide in adults with LGS in the clinical setting. The present report is a retrospective, open-label treatment study carried out from June 2013 to December 2014 at the National Institute of Colombia. Lacosamide was introduced as add-on therapy. All caregivers were instructed to initiate lacosamide at low doses (25-50mg) and gradually increasing it every 2 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated based on the reduction in the rate of each countable type of seizure. We also evaluated the retention rate for lacosamide as the number of days with lacosamide during follow-up. The tolerability was evaluated base on account the adverse events. We found that lacosamide only improves the seizure rate in three out of 19 patients with LGS, in two of them by more than 50%. The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the focal and tonic-clonic seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events were worsening of seizures, aggressiveness and irritability. Nine patients (47.4%) showed worsening of their behavior during the treatment with lacosamide. Lacosamide can exacerbate both, the tonic and astatic seizures, and the encephalopathy associated with this epileptic syndrome. However, it is interesting to consider the likelihood of suppression of generalized tonic-clonic and focal seizures. That is why; lacosamide could be an option after carefully balancing risks and benefits in each individual case.

Structural consideration of DNM1 mutations revealed that both mutations would destabilize the G domain structure and impair nucleotide binding, dimer formation, and/or GTPase activity of the G domain. These and previous cases of DNM1 mutations were reviewed to verify the phenotypic spectrum. The main clinical features of DNM1 mutations include intractable seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Most cases showed development delay before the onset of seizures. A patient carrying p.Arg237Trp in this report showed a different developmental status from that of a previously reported case, together with characteristic extrapyramidal movement.

Using a SureSelectXT custom multiple gene panel covering 48 early infantile epileptic encephalopathy/developmental delay genes, a novel de novo GABRB3 heterozygous missense mutation, c.860C>T (p.Thr287Ile), was identified and confirmed on Sanger sequencing. GABRB3 is an emerging cause of early-onset epilepsy. Novel genetic technologies, such as whole-exome/genome sequencing and multiple gene panels, will undoubtedly identify further cases, allowing more detailed electroclinical delineation of the GABRB3-related genotypic and phenotypic spectra.

"	"Almost a third of patients with epilepsy have a treatment-resistant form, which is associated with severe morbidity and increased mortality. Cannabis-based treatments for epilepsy have generated much interest, but scientific data are scarce. We aimed to establish whether addition of cannabidiol to existing anti-epileptic regimens would be safe, tolerated, and efficacious in children and young adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. In this open-label trial, patients (aged 1-30 years) with severe, intractable, childhood-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy, who were receiving stable doses of antiepileptic drugs before study entry, were enrolled in an expanded-access programme at 11 epilepsy centres across the USA. Patients were given oral cannabidiol at 2-5 mg/kg per day, up-titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day (dependent on study site). The primary objective was to establish the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol and the primary efficacy endpoint was median percentage change in the mean monthly frequency of motor seizures at 12 weeks. The efficacy analysis was by modified intention to treat. Comparisons of the percentage change in frequency of motor seizures were done with a Mann-Whitney U test. Between Jan 15, 2014, and Jan 15, 2015, 214 patients were enrolled; 162 (76%) patients who had at least 12 weeks of follow-up after the first dose of cannabidiol were included in the safety and tolerability analysis, and 137 (64%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. In the safety group, 33 (20%) patients had Dravet syndrome and 31 (19%) patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The remaining patients had intractable epilepsies of different causes and type. Adverse events were reported in 128 (79%) of the 162 patients within the safety group. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients were somnolence (n=41 [25%]), decreased appetite (n=31 [19%]), diarrhoea (n=31 [19%]), fatigue (n=21 [13%]), and convulsion (n=18 [11%]). Five (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Serious adverse events were reported in 48 (30%) patients, including one death-a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy regarded as unrelated to study drug. 20 (12%) patients had severe adverse events possibly related to cannabidiol use, the most common of which was status epilepticus (n=9 [6%]). The median monthly frequency of motor seizures was 30.0 (IQR 11.0-96.0) at baseline and 15.8 (5.6-57.6) over the 12 week treatment period. The median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 36.5% (IQR 0-64.7). Our findings suggest that cannabidiol might reduce seizure frequency and might have an adequate safety profile in children and young adults with highly treatment-resistant epilepsy. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to characterise the safety profile and true efficacy of this compound.

"	"A good knowledge of safety and age group-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in young pediatric patients is of great importance in clinical practice. This paper presents 6-month interim safety and PK from an ongoing 2-year open-label study (Study 303) of adjunctive rufinamide treatment in pediatric subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years with inadequately controlled epilepsies of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) spectrum. Subjects (N = 37) were randomized to either rufinamide or any other approved AED chosen by the investigator as adjunctive therapy to the subject's existing regimen of 1-3 AEDs. Interim safety results showed that treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the rufinamide (22 [88.0%]) and any-other-AED group (9 [81.8%]), with most events considered mild or moderate. A population PK analysis was conducted including plasma rufinamide concentrations from Study 303 and two other study populations of LGS subjects ≥ 4 years. The rufinamide PK profile was dose independent. The apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated from the PK model was 2.19 L/h; it was found to increase significantly as a function of body weight. Coadministration of valproic acid significantly decreased rufinamide CL/F. CL/F was not significantly affected by other concomitant AEDs, age, gender, race, hepatic function, or renal function. No adjustments to body weight-based rufinamide dosing in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years are necessary. Rufinamide was safe and well tolerated in these pediatric subjects. Results from the interim analysis demonstrate that rufinamide's safety and PK profile is comparable in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 and ≥ 4 years with LGS. Study 303 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01405053).

"	"To evaluate the long-term safety and seizure outcome in Japanese patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) receiving adjunctive rufinamide therapy. We conducted an open-label extension study following a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive rufinamide therapy in Japanese patients with LGS. Fifty-four patients participated in the extension study. Seizure frequency was evaluated until 52 weeks after the start of the extension study. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout both studies. Of the 54 patients, 41 (75.9%) completed the extension study. The median duration of exposure to rufinamide was 818.0 days in all 54 patients, and 38 patients (70.4%) received rufinamide for 2 years or more. The median percent change in the frequency of tonic-atonic seizures relative to the frequency at the start of the double-blind study was -39.3% (12 weeks), -40.6% (24 weeks), -46.8% (32 weeks), -47.6% (40 weeks), and -36.1% (52 weeks). Reduction of total seizure frequency was also maintained until 52 weeks. Frequent treatment-related AEs were somnolence (20.4%), decreased appetite (16.7%), transient seizure aggravation including status epilepticus (13.0%), vomiting (11.1%), and constipation (11.1%). Adverse events were mild or moderate, except for transient seizure aggravation in three patients. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of rufinamide were decreased appetite, drug eruption, and worsening of underlying autism. When clinically notable weight loss was defined as a decrease ≥ 7% relative to baseline, 22 patients (40.7%) experienced weight loss at least once during long-term observation, although weight loss was reported as an AE in only three patients. This study demonstrated a long-term benefit of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for Japanese patients with LGS. Exacerbation of seizures and decreased appetite/weight loss should be monitored carefully.

"	"Felbamate was approved in 1993 to treat partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in children. Its use was later restricted when rare but fatal cases of aplastic anemia and hepatic failure were identified. This single center analysis retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of felbamate in a cohort of children, adolescents, and adults with epilepsy. A chart review identified 103 patients taking felbamate. The range of felbamate dose was 300-4500 mg (mean: 1800 ± 900 mg). The duration of therapy ranged from 1 month to 20 years (mean duration: 35 ± 45 months). Eighteen (17.5%) subjects experienced adverse events including insomnia, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, gastric discomfort, diarrhea, mood and behavioral problems, high blood pressure, headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Out of these, 6 (5.9%) patients discontinued the therapy. No hepatic failure or agranulocytosis was observed. Fifty-nine (57.72%) patients achieved ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 30 (29.12%) patients achieved seizure freedom. These findings suggest that felbamate is safe, well tolerated, and effective in treatment of various types of epilepsy syndromes.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is characterized by interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) occurring during sleep. The aim of this study was to determine whether sleep influences not only the frequency of seizures and IEDs, but also the time-dependent evolution that may support the hypothesis of homeostatic influences on epileptic threshold. Video polysomnography data from our database were reviewed to identify adult LGS patients with at least seven hours of nocturnal recording. Thirteen patients were identified and a second polysomnography was available for nine. The number, duration and index of IEDs, relative to total sleep, sleep stages, and time during the night, were calculated. The majority of IEDs occurred during non-rapid eye movement sleep, mainly in stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. Adjusting for time spent in each sleep stage, we found 45 IEDs/hour in stage 1, 123/hour in stage 2, 106/hour in slow-wave sleep, and 26/hour in rapid eye movement sleep. The temporal distribution of IEDs showed a significant rise in the first three hours of sleep, followed by a progressive decrease at the end of the night (F=85.6; p<0.0001). Interictal epileptiform discharges occurrence in adult LGS is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement sleep with an evident effect of stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. The significant IED occurrence in the first part of the night and the subsequent decline suggests a link between epileptic threshold and homeostatic sleep mechanisms. The latter should be considered regarding choice of therapy.

"	"To analyze the factors involved in the prognosis of non-symptomatic epilepsy (idiopathic and cryptogenic) in relation to their age of onset, monitored at a regional section of Neuropediatry reference over a period of three years. Patients with diagnosis of non-symptomatic epilepsy supervised from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, collecting epidemiological, clinical, complementary examinations and developmental data. Of the 4595 children attended during the period, the diagnosis of epilepsy was established in 605 (13.17%): 156 (25.79%) idiopathic epilepsies and 172 (28.43%) cryptogenic epilepsies. 15.7% of cryptogenic epilepsies and 14.1% of idiopathic epilepsies are refractory to treatment. Some epileptic syndromes, such as reflex epilepsies, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, have higher rates of drug resistance. 84.62% of idiopathic epilepsies and 79.77% of cryptogenic epilepsies present no other associated neurological disorder. A useful classification would be etiological, with two groups: a large group with established etiology or very likely genetic syndromes and another with no established cause. The age of onset of epilepsy in each etiological group adds prognostic orientation. Prognosis of epilepsy is worsened by refractoriness and associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and are generally worse at an earlier onset and in certain etiologies.

"	"Management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in adulthood can be particularly challenging. Published reports describing the use of rufinamide specifically in adult patients with LGS are scarce. A post hoc subgroup analysis of data from a phase III trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of rufinamide in adults with LGS. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with LGS, aged 4 years and above. During an 84-day, double-blind treatment period, patients received either adjunctive rufinamide therapy or placebo. Efficacy and safety/tolerability were assessed in a post hoc subgroup analysis of adult patients (≥18 years). Efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency, 50% responder rate, and seizure freedom rate; each calculated for total seizures and drop attacks. Safety/tolerability assessments included the evaluation of adverse events (AEs). Thirty-one adults aged 18-37 years with LGS received treatment with either rufinamide (n = 21) or placebo (n = 10). Three patients in the rufinamide group did not complete the trial. The median change from baseline in seizure frequency was -31.5% for rufinamide versus +22.1% for placebo (P = 0.008) for all seizures and -54.9% versus +21.7% (P = 0.002) for drop attacks. Responder rates were 33.3% for rufinamide versus 0% for placebo (P = 0.066) for all seizures and 57.1% versus 10.0% (P = 0.020) for drop attacks. No patient achieved freedom from all seizures but two rufinamide-treated patients (9.5%) became free of drop attacks. Overall, 71.4% of patients treated with rufinamide and 60.0% of patients treated with placebo experienced AEs; most commonly, somnolence (33.3% vs. 20.0%) and vomiting (19.0% vs. 0%). Most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Rufinamide demonstrated favorable efficacy and was generally well tolerated when used as adjunctive treatment for adults with LGS. Eisai.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug used as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and provides seizure control especially in tonic and atonic seizures. Rufinamide is expected to be effective in intractable epilepsy when atonic and tonic seizures exist. However, rufinamide induced seizure aggravation has been reported in a few patients, which was not associated with a specific type of seizure. A 12-year-old boy with intractable epilepsy had tonic and atonic seizures despite treatment with valproic acid (3000mg/day), levetiracetam (3000mg/day) and clobazam (40mg/day). Rufinamide was administered as adjuvant therapy. After 2weeks on rufinamide, he experienced atonic seizure worsening, and the frequency of epileptic discharges increased. The deterioration in seizure frequency and epileptiform discharges resolved when rufinamide was discontinued. Rufinamide may aggravate atonic seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy.

26945476	"Abnormal cognitive network interactions in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A potential mechanism of epileptic encephalopathy
"	"In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), recurrent epileptic activity is thought to contribute to impaired cognition (epileptic encephalopathy). Using concurrent electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), we recently showed that epileptiform discharges in LGS recruit large-scale networks that normally support key cognitive processes. In LGS, given that epileptic activity engages cognitive networks, and cognition is pervasively impaired, we hypothesized that cognitive network interactions in LGS are persistently abnormal. We studied 15 LGS patients (mean age ± 1 standard deviation [SD] = 28.7 ± 10.6 years) and 17 healthy controls (mean age ± 1 SD = 27.6 ± 6.6 years) using task-free EEG-fMRI. Four networks of interest (default-mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and anterior salience) were defined using group-level independent components analysis (ICA). Functional connectivity within and between networks was determined for each subject, and then LGS network interactions were compared to network behavior in the control group. To test whether group differences were present in periods without scalp-detectable epileptiform discharges (i.e., persistent), we separately assessed discharge-affected and discharge-unaffected epochs in six patients with sufficient data for this analysis. In LGS, cognitive networks showed (1) reduced within-network integration, including weaker connectivity within the default-mode network, and (2) impaired between-network segregation, including stronger connectivity between the default-mode and dorsal attention networks. Abnormal interactions were present during fMRI periods with and without discharges, indicating that impaired network behavior may endure during periods without scalp-detectable epileptic activity. In LGS, cognitive network interactions are persistently abnormal. Given that cognition typically worsens with the onset of LGS, and may improve after seizure control, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the epileptic process in LGS may initiate and perhaps sustain abnormal network behavior. We propose that epileptic encephalopathy may be a consequence of persistently disrupted cognitive network interactions.

"	"The Epi4K Consortium recently identified 4 de novo mutations in the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor β3 subunit gene GABRB3 and 1 in the β1 subunit gene GABRB1 in children with one of the epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and infantile spasms (IS). Because the etiology of EEs is often unknown, we determined the impact of GABRB mutations on GABAA receptor function and biogenesis. GABAA receptor α1 and γ2L subunits were coexpressed with wild-type and/or mutant β3 or β1 subunits in HEK 293T cells. Currents were measured using whole cell and single channel patch clamp techniques. Surface and total expression levels were measured using flow cytometry. Potential structural perturbations in mutant GABAA receptors were explored using structural modeling. LGS-associated GABRB3(D120N, E180G, Y302C) mutations located at β+ subunit interfaces reduced whole cell currents by decreasing single channel open probability without loss of surface receptors. In contrast, IS-associated GABRB3(N110D) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations at β- subunit interfaces produced minor changes in whole cell current peak amplitude but altered current deactivation by decreasing or increasing single channel burst duration, respectively. GABRB3(E180G) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations also produced spontaneous channel openings. All 5 de novo GABRB mutations impaired GABAA receptor function by rearranging conserved structural domains, supporting their role in EEs. The primary effect of LGS-associated mutations was reduced GABA-evoked peak current amplitudes, whereas the major impact of IS-associated mutations was on current kinetic properties. Despite lack of association with epilepsy syndromes, our results suggest GABRB1 as a candidate human epilepsy gene. Ann Neurol 2016;79:806-825.

Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed by age 8 with intractable seizures, developmental delay, and abnormal EEGs with 1.5-2 Hz SSW discharges. However, seizure type and frequency changed over time for both patients, and the incidence of SSW discharges decreased. Cases 3, 4, and 5 were diagnosed with LGS as adults based on current and past features and symptoms, including treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive and motor impairment, and abnormal EEG findings. While incomplete, their records indicate that an earlier LGS diagnosis may have been missed or lost to history. These cases demonstrate the need to thoroughly and continuously evaluate all aspects of a patient's encephalopathy, bearing in mind the potential for LGS features to change over time.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types, including drop attacks (DAs). Palliative procedures such as corpus callosotomy (CC) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may be effective for adequate seizure control in LGS patients who are not candidates for resective surgery. We evaluated the efficacy of the combination of these two procedures for LGS-related seizures. Ten patients with LGS (age 3-30 years at VNS implantation) underwent CC and subsequent VNS. We evaluated surgical outcomes, particularly with respect to the efficacy of VNS on seizure reduction rates for different residual seizure types after CC. We compared clinical parameters, including sex, age, seizure duration, history, MRI findings, extent of CC, number of antiepileptic drugs, and neuropsychological states, between VNS responders and non-responders to predict satisfactory seizure outcomes with respect to residual seizures after CC. VNS was effective for residual seizures regardless of seizure type (except for DAs) after CC in patients with LGS. Six of ten (60%) patients had a satisfactory seizure outcome (≥50% seizure reduction) for all residual seizure types after VNS. Two of ten (20%) patients were seizure-free at 12 months post-VNS. Even those patients that were non-responders, with respect to all seizures including DAs, after prior CC showed favorable responses to subsequent VNS. Compared to VNS, excellent seizure outcomes for DAs were achieved after CC in seven of nine (77.8%) patients with DAs. Among the clinical parameters, only conversation ability before VNS was significantly different between responders and non-responders (p = 0.033). Combined VNS and prior CC produced satisfactory seizure outcomes in LGS patients with different seizure types, including DAs. Even non-responders to prior CC responded to subsequent VNS for residual seizures, except for DAs. There is a greater likelihood that these procedures may be more feasible in patients who possess conversation ability prior to VNS.

In this post hoc analysis of phase 3 OV-1012 data, a medical review was conducted of seizure-related injuries based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms from all adverse event (AE) listings. Patients receiving clobazam experienced fewer seizure-related injuries than those receiving placebo (8.9% all clobazam dosages vs. 27.1% placebo, p ≤ 0.05). Significant differences in the rates of seizure-related injuries were observed for the medium- and high-dosage clobazam treatment groups (4.8% and 10.2%, respectively, p ≤ 0.05). A total of 50 of 53 AEs considered seizure-related were mild or moderate in intensity; 3 severe AEs occurred in the placebo group (fall, contusion, and jaw fracture). A single serious AE (jaw fracture, which required hospitalization and surgery) occurred in a placebo-treated patient. Most injuries resolved by the end of the study. This analysis indicates that the reduction in drop-seizure frequency achieved with clobazam provides a clinically meaningful benefit, a reduced likelihood of experiencing seizure-related injuries.

"	"Dynamin 1 is a large neuron-specific GTPase involved in the endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 1 (DNM1) underlie two epileptic encephalopathy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Mice homozygous for the Dnm1 ""fitful"" mutation, a non-synonymous coding variant in an alternatively spliced exon of Dnm1 (exon 10a; isoform designation: Dnm1a(Ftfl)) have an epileptic encephalopathy-like disorder including lethal early onset seizures, locomotor and neurosensory deficits. Although fitful heterozygotes have milder recurrent seizures later in life, suggesting an additive or semi-dominant mechanism, the molecular etiology must also consider the fact that Dnm1a(Ftfl) exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in vitro. Another complication is that the fitful mutation induces alterations in the relative abundance of Dnm1 splice variants; mutants have a downregulation of Dnm1a and an upregulation of Dnm1b, changes which may contribute to the epileptic pathology. To examine whether Dnm1a loss of function, Dnm1a(Ftfl) dominance or compensation by Dnm1b is the most critical for severe seizures, we studied alternate isoform-specific mutant mice. Mice lacking Dnm1 exon 10a or Dnm1 exon 10b have neither spontaneous seizures nor other overt abnormalities, suggesting that in normal conditions the major role of each isoform is redundant. However, in the presence of Dnm1a(Ftfl) only exon 10a deleted mice experience severe seizures. These results reveal functional differences between Dnm1a and Dnm1b isoforms in the presence of a challenge, i.e. toxic Dnm1(Ftfl), while reinforcing its effect explicitly in this model of severe pediatric epilepsy.

"	"Ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) are characteristic signal patterns of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy, which assist with the diagnosis and characterization of various types of epilepsy. The EEG signal, however, is often recorded from patients with epilepsy for a long period of time, and thus detection and identification of EDs have been a burden on medical doctors. This paper proposes a new method for automatic identification of two types of EDs, repeated sharp-waves (sharps), and runs of sharp-and-slow-waves (SSWs), which helps to pinpoint epileptogenic foci in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). In the experiments with iEEG data acquired from a patient with LGS, our proposed method detected EDs with an accuracy of 93.76% and classified three different signal patterns with a mean classification accuracy of 87.69%, which was significantly higher than that of a conventional wavelet-based method. Our study shows that it is possible to successfully detect and discriminate sharps and SSWs from background EEG activity using our proposed method.

Metabolites represent 40 to 60% of excretion and are eliminated via the urine. The half-life is between 15 and 23 hours. Clearance is dependent on renal function. There is a concentration - efficacy and concentration - toxicity relationship. These arguments are in favour of a TDM but the therapeutic range is not clearly established. Potentially fatal side effects can be caused by felbamate (aplastic anemia, acute liver failure), which limits its use because they are dose-independant.

The outcome of CM stimulation was evaluated as percent seizure reduction compared to the baseline 3 months. To establish the location of active contacts, 27 leads were studied in 14 patients with refractory epilepsy. An analysis was conducted to reveal whether any coordinates of the center of the active contacts predicted percent seizure reduction. With an average follow-up of 18.2 ± 5.6 months, the mean percent seizure reduction (n = 14) was 68 ± 22.4% (25-100%). Eleven of the 14 patients (78.6%) achieved >50% improvement in seizure frequency. Specifically, all 4 patients (100%) with generalized epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and 7 of 10 patients (70%) with multilobar epilepsy showed >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The mean coordinates of the center of the active contact were located in the superior part of the anterior ventrolateral CM. The calculated coordinates of laterality from midline (x), anterior-posterior (y) and height (z) from the posterior commissure did not correlate with seizure outcome measured by percent seizure reduction. However, the locations of active contacts used during chronic CM stimulation in multilobar epilepsy were identified more dorsal to those used in generalized epilepsy.

Fifty-one cases (68.0%) presented clinically as focal epilepsy (FE) and 24 (32.0%) as epileptic encephalopathy (EE), including 16 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 8 with West syndrome. We observed EE in 7 cases (63.6%) in FCD type I, 14 (41.2%) in type IIa, 2 (10.5%) in type IIb, and 1 (9.1%) in type III. We found the following more frequently in EE: seizure onset occurring at younger than 2 years (EE: 20 [83.3%], FE: 19 [37.3%]; p < 0.001), presence of intellectual disability before surgery (EE: 22 [91.7%], FE: 29 [56.9%]; p = 0.003), and multilobar resections (EE: 19 [79.2%], FE: 15 [29.4%]; p < 0.001). Forty-eight cases (64.0%) were seizure-free; 66.7% (34/51) in FE, 58.3% (14/24) in EE. Neurodevelopmental level showed more improvement (11/48 vs 0/27, p = 0.011) and less deterioration (2/48 vs 9/27, p = 0.001) in the seizure-free group compared to the non-seizure-free group. FCD can cause FE and EE in pediatric age, and resective surgery should be considered as a treatment option for both types of epilepsy.

"	"Previous studies using verapamil as an adjunct therapy to anti-seizure medications have used doses ranging from 120 to 240mg per day. However, despite showing promising results, there was an increased incidence of side effects. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of low dose verapamil (20mg p.o. tid) as adjunct therapy to patient's anti-seizure medications irrespective of the type or etiology of the epilepsy. In an open-label pilot study we enrolled 20 adult patients with history of epilepsy who continued to have a minimum of 2 seizures a month despite being on or having tried maximum tolerated doses of 3 or more standard antiepileptic drugs under the supervision of an epileptologist. 10 of the 19 patients (53%) who continued in the study had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. 2 of the patients (10%) had <50% seizure reduction. The remaining 7 patients (37%) had no reduction in their seizures. There was no discontinuation due to adverse events. P-Glycoprotein is a prototypical drug transporter that has been strongly implicated in drug resistance in epilepsy. Verapamil at a relatively low dose was well tolerated compared to previous studies which used up to 240mg per day and seems to have contributed to a statistically significant improvement in seizure control in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, especially in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A randomized double blind controlled study at this low dose with larger sample size may be more informative.

"	"Previous reports summarized the seizure types occurring in patients with idic(15) syndrome. To better define this issue, we retrospectively analyzed the evolution of electroencephalogram findings and seizures in 35 patients with confirmed idic(15). Epilepsy occurred in 28 patients (80%), with a median age of onset of 3 years 3 months. The initial seizures were infantile spasms associated with a hypsarrhythmic electroencephalogram (nine patients), focal/generalized tonic (seven patients), or atypical absences (eight patients). High doses of oral steroids were given in all nine children with infantile spasms, with remission of seizures and resolution of electroencephalogram abnormalities. Among them, three were seizure free at the time of evaluation, but six later developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut-like syndrome. The eight patients with atypical absences developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut-like syndrome. Epilepsy was well controlled in 32% of the patients; satisfactorily controlled (seizures reduced >75%) in 21.4%; partially controlled (seizures reduced <50%) in 10.7%; and uncontrolled in 32%. One patient was not taking any anti-epileptic drugs by his parents' choice. Fourteen percent were on monotherapy; whereas the other 82% were on polytherapy. Seizures stopped at a median age of 5 years 5 months. The interictal electroencephalogram showed slow/sharp waves, and/or biphasic spikes-polyspikes, spike/wave complexes, and an excess of fast activity mainly over the fronto-temporal areas. Epilepsy is a major clinical challenge in patients with idic(15), associated with a poor prognosis in 55%. Frontal lobe seizures are a novel finding. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"	"Epilepsy is a serious chronic health condition with a high morbidity impairing the life of patients and afflicted families. Many epileptic conditions, especially those affecting children, are rare disorders generating an urgent medical need for more efficacious therapy options. Therefore, we assessed the output of the US and European orphan drug legislations. Quantitative analysis of the FDA and EMA databases for orphan drug designations according to STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Within the US Orphan Drug Act 40 designations were granted delivering nine approvals, i.e. clobazam, diazepam viscous solution for rectal administration, felbamate, fosphenytoin, lamotrigine, repository corticotropin, rufinamide, topiramate, and vigabatrin. Since 2000 the EMA granted six orphan drug designations whereof two compounds were approved, i.e. rufinamide and stiripentol. In the US, two orphan drug designations were withdrawn. Orphan drugs were approved for conditions including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, Dravet syndrome, and status epilepticus. Comparing time to approval for rufinamide, which was approved in the US and the EU to treat rare seizure conditions, the process seems faster in the EU (2.2 years) than in the US (4.3 years). Orphan drug development in the US and in the EU delivered only few molecular entities to treat rare seizure disorders. The development programs focused on already approved antiepileptic drugs or alternative pharmaceutical formulations. Most orphan drugs approved in the US are not approved in the EU to treat rare seizures although some were introduced after 2000 when the EU adopted the Orphan Drug Regulation.

"	"The first prospective trial for resective surgery combined with corpus callosotomy (CCT) was performed to investigate the outcomes of the combined surgery in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) without focal lesion on brain MRI. This study enrolled 68 children with LGS and without focal lesion on brain MRI, of which 25 received medicine (medicine group) and 43 underwent surgery (surgery group), including 20 with exclusively resective surgery (exclusively resection subgroup) and 23 with resective surgery combined with CCT (combined CCT subgroup). All patients were followed for 3-5 years. Significant differences in seizure control were observed between the medicine group and the exclusively resection subgroup and combined CCT subgroup at the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year follow-ups. There was a trend that the children with resection combined with CCT had better seizure control than those with exclusively resection at the three follow-ups, but this could not be verified by the statistical method used. Furthermore, significant differences were not observed in seizure control between children with different MRI findings, age at surgery, or pathology in the surgery group. The percentage of long-term seizure-free did not remain as high as the percentage of early stage seizure-free at 1-year follow-up. However, the children with combined CCT surgery demonstrated more postoperative improvement than the children with resective surgery alone based on the mean QOL score (10.78 vs. 5.75, p = 0.0152) and full-scale IQ (7.91 vs. 4.55, p = 0.0446). Resective surgery combined with CCT can provide favorable seizure control and obvious improvements in QOL and IQ in children with LGS. This combined approach can be performed in carefully selected LGS children without focal lesions and can localize the epileptogenic zone following a comprehensive preoperative evaluation.

There were 164 relevant articles available via medico-clinical periodic databases, but only 15 have been chosen suitable for meta-analysis. All together 1847 participants were included into common massive, with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and similar encephalopathy syndromes, and with drug-resistant partial epileptic forms. 1169 were administered rufinamide additionally to typical anti-epileptic medications (experimental group). 686 received treatment with common practice drugs without rufinamide (control group). Patient with more than 50% seizures reduction were more numerous in rufinamide group (χ2=89.7 with р=0.000...; ОR=2.9 with 95% CI 2.3-3.7). Most frequent and statistically reliable complications of rufinamide use were headache/dizziness and nausea/vomiting.

"	"The purpose of the current study was to characterize the frequency profiles of epileptogenic regions, independent of visible epileptiform discharges, in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) patients. We selected eight LGS patients who underwent resective surgery in the absence of definite neuroimaging findings. We calculated the absolute and relative band powers of continuous spike-free iEEG data and compared the characteristics of the resected and remaining regions. For absolute band powers, there was a trend for higher absolute gamma band power in the remaining brain section. We also found that the absolute delta power in the resected area was higher than that in the remaining area. However, this trend was not statistically different in all patients. For relative band powers, we found decreased relative band power in the beta and gamma band ranges within the areas defined by the surgical margins. Delta, theta, and alpha relative band power differences between the resected and remaining areas were inconsistent between the subjects. Our results showed systematic relative beta and gamma band power variation in the resected areas of LGS patients.

"	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) on the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and explore the relationships between EEG changes and clinical efficacy. We retrospectively studied 47 patients with LGS who accepted KD therapy between May 2011 and May 2015. Clinical efficacy and EEG features such as background activity, abnormal interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) and the discharge location were evaluated prior to and at 3 and 6 months after therapy. Responders were defined as ≥50% seizure reduction. At 3 months of treatment, 23 patients (48.9%) had ≥50% seizure reduction. Seven patients (14.9%) discontinued treatment between 3 and 6 months because of lack of efficacy or inability to adhere to the diet. At 6 months of treatment, 4 patients (10%) were seizure free, 5 (12.5%) had ≥90% seizure reduction, 12 (30%) had a reduction of 50-89%, and 19 (47.5%) had <50% reduction. Patients with improved EEG background and reduced IEDs had an improved seizure reduction rate compared with patients without change in EEG background or IEDs (p<0.01). The results show that the KD is effective in LGS. It can control seizures and improve EEG abnormalities. Early improvement in the EEG background and a reduction in IEDs may be predictors of a patient's response to diet.

"	"Drug-resistant epilepsy, not associated with acute brain complications or central nervous system leukaemic involvement, can develop in patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukaemia during childhood. It has been postulated that this rare complication may be due to CNS oncological treatment neurotoxicity, related to intrathecal drugs, such as methotrexate, and brain radiotherapy. We report four patients who developed drug-resistant epilepsy sometime after receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. All patients were female and received intrathecal methotrexate. One received additional intrathecal cytarabine, and two concomitant brain radiotherapy. Two developed Lennox-Gastaut type syndrome, one multifocal epilepsy, and one focal epilepsy related to a radiotherapy-induced cavernous angioma. The development of drug-resistant epilepsy after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia is a rare complication that may vary, from focal epilepsy to an epileptic encephalopathy. This may appear even years after the treatment has finished and is most likely associated with treatment-related neurotoxicity.

"	"There have been a few reports of patients who developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in the second decades of their life. The aim of this study was to investigate electroclinical presentation in patients with late-onset LGS. In addition, we evaluated structural abnormalities of the brain, which may give some clue about the common pathogenic pathway in LGS. We enrolled the patients with late-onset LGS. We collected electroclinical characteristics of the patients and evaluated structural abnormalities using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. The three subjects were diagnosed with late-onset LGS. The patients have no mental retardation and normal background activities on electroencephalography (EEG), and they had generalized paroxysmal fast activities on EEG, especially during sleep. The TBSS analysis revealed that fractional anisotropy values in the patients were significantly reduced in the white matter of brainstem compared with normal controls. However, VBM analysis did not show any significant difference between the patients and normal controls. Patients with late-onset LGS have different clinical and EEG characteristics from those with early-onset LGS. In addition, we demonstrated that brainstem dysfunction might contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset LGS.

"	"The objective of this work was to review systematically the efficacy and tolerability of perampanel (PER) in residential patients of an epilepsy center. We adopted an industry-independent noninterventional retrospective evaluation on the basis of the paper and electronic records complemented by personal information on the part of the treating neurologists. All patients (N=26, 15 females, mean age: 30, range 21-55years) started on PER from its introduction to the market in September 2012 until December 15th 2013 were included. Evaluation was carried out after 6, 12, and 24months of PER treatment. Changes in seizure frequency were calculated as the number of seizures during three months on PER compared to a three-month baseline period. The Clinical Global Impression Scale served as an instrument to record changes in seizure intensity beyond numerical values. Adverse effects were documented by means of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile. Most patients had structural or metabolic epilepsy, 2 patients suffered from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 2 from other symptomatic generalized epilepsy. All patients had grade III drug-resistant epilepsy. All patients had additional cognitive deficits of different degree. The retention rates were 61.5% after 6months, 46.2% after 12months, and 42.3% after 24months. The responder rates were 11.5% after 6months, 23.1% after 12months, and 7.7% after 24months. Partial responders (positive CGI and/or seizure reduction <50%) included, the respective values were 26.9%, 38.5%, and 23.1%. Only 1 patient was seizure free at 12months (but not at 24months). A loss of efficacy in the second year of treatment was suspected but the decrease of the responder rate could also be ascribed to a number of different circumstances. Adverse effects in the psychiatric field like irritability, aggression, increased sensitivity, and suicidal ideation/behavior occurred in 50% of the patients. They were the main reason to discontinue PER. After one year of treatment PER showed reasonable efficacy in a particularly difficult-to-treat population. Psychiatric adverse effects forced discontinuation in many cases.

SCN10A is a member of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene family. Sodium channels are responsible for the instigation and proliferation of action potentials in central and peripheral nervous systems. Heterozygous mutations in VGSC genes cause a wide range of epileptic and peripheral nervous system disorders. This report presents autosomal recessive mutations in SCN10A that may be linked to epilepsy-related phenotypes, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

"	"We previously observed that adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) show abnormal functional connectivity among cognitive networks, suggesting that this may contribute to impaired cognition. Herein we report network reorganization following seizure remission in a child with LGS who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after resection of a cortical dysplasia. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired during presurgical fMRI. Presurgical and postsurgical functional connectivity were compared using (1) graph theoretical analyses of small-world network organization and node-wise strength; and (2) seed-based analyses of connectivity within and between five functional networks. To explore the specificity of these postsurgical network changes, connectivity was further compared to nine children with LGS who did not undergo surgery. The presurgical EEG-fMRI revealed diffuse activation of association cortex during interictal discharges. Following surgery and seizure control, functional connectivity showed increased small-world organization, stronger connectivity in subcortical structures, and greater within-network integration/between-network segregation. These changes suggest network improvement, and diverged sharply from the comparison group of nonoperated children. Following surgery, this child with LGS achieved seizure control and showed extensive reorganization of networks that underpin cognition. This case illustrates that the epileptic process of LGS can directly contribute to abnormal network organization, and that this network disruption may be reversible.

We implemented a rare variant transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) to search for autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy genes in a cohort of 320 outbred patient-parent trios that were generally prescreened for rare metabolic disorders. In the current sample, our rare variant transmission disequilibrium test did not identify individual genes with significantly distorted transmission over expectation after correcting for the multiple tests. While the rare variant transmission disequilibrium test did not find evidence of a role for individual autosomal recessive genes, our current sample is insufficiently powered to assess the overall role of autosomal recessive genotypes in an outbred epileptic encephalopathy population.

LGS type of seizures is epilepsy which is due to abnormal vibrations occurring in seizures. During the time of such abnormal vibrations, both the seizures and the lungs suffer a lack in oxygen content to a considerable extent. This results in prolonged vibrations and loses of nervous control. As a neuro-lung protective strategy, a novel attempt has been made to enrich both seizures and lungs with oxygen content through the support of Perfluorodecalin (an excellent oxygen carrier) C10F18(PFD) and Perfluorohexane C6F14(PFH) along with an enhancement in the antiepileptic activity by the two chosen antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Benzodiazepine (BDZ).

Among 957 patients admitted to video-EEG monitoring between 2002 and 2015, we retrospectively research adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy, drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. We collected demographic, anamnestic, and clinical data from medical records. We reviewed for all patients the interictal and ictal video-EEG recordings. We identified ten patients with focal epilepsy and electro-clinical features of LGS. As compared to classical LGS patients, our patients: (1) began epilepsy later (15.4 ± 8 years); (2) exhibited exclusively focal onset seizures, including drop attacks seizures linked to focal asymmetrical tonic posturing seizures; (3) had a stable cognition over time and (4) evolved favourably with a good secondary response to treatments in 80% of cases. Interestingly, all patients exhibited apparent diffuse interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities but a detailed analysis revealed that 50% had asymmetrical GPFA and 70% secondary bilateral synchrony processes. We may hypothesize here that a process of ""secondary LGS"" occurred which produced a worsening of seizures with the apparition of drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. This study brings arguments to consider that some cases of LGS could be linked to the development of a ""secondary epileptic network"" driven by a primary focal epileptic zone.

So far (Zavala-Yoe et al., J Integr Neurosci 15(2):205-223, 2015a and works of ours there), quantitative analysis of single case studies of EE have been performed. All of them are manifestations of drug resistant epileptic encephalopathies (DREES) and as known, such disorders require a lot of EEG studies through all patient's life. As a consequence, dozens of EEG records are stored by parents and neurologists as time goes by. However, taking into account all this massive information, our research questions (keeping colloquial wording by parents) arise: a) Which zone of the brain has been the most affected so far? b) On which year was the child better? c) How bad is our child with respect to others? We must reflect that despite clinical assessment of the EEG has undergone standardization by establishment of guidelines such as the recently published guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (Tsuchida et al., J Clin Neurophysiol 4(33):301-302, 2016), qualitative EEG will never be as objective as quantitative EEG, since it depends largely on the education and experience of the conducting neurophysiologist (Grant et al., Epilepsy Behav 2014(32):102-107, 2014, Rating, Z Epileptologie, Springer Med 27(2):139-142, 2014). We already answered quantitatively the above mentioned questions in the references of ours given above where we provided entropy curves and an entropy index which encompasses the complexity of bunches of EEG making possible to deal with massive data and to make objective comparisons among some patients simultaneously. However, we have refined that index here and we also offer another two measures which are spatial and dynamic. Moreover, from those indices we also provide what we call a temporal dynamic complexity path which shows in a standard 10-20 system head diagram the evolution of the lowest complexity per brain zone with respect to the EEG period. These results make it possible to compare quantitatively/graphically the progress of several patients at the same time, answering the questions posed above. The results obtained showed that we can associate low spatio-temporal entropy indices to multiple seizures events in several patients at the same time as well as tracking seizure progress in space and time with our entropy path, coinciding with neurophysiologists observations.

28633092	"Epilepsy in neurofibromatosis type 1
"	"To describe the characteristics of epilepsy in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Analysis of a cohort of consecutive NF1 patients seen in our NF1 clinic during a three-year period. Of the 184 NF1 patients seen during that period, 26 had epilepsy and three had febrile seizures. Of the 26, 17 (65%) had localization-related epilepsy, seven of whom (41%) were drug resistant. Six (23%) had apparently primary generalized epilepsy (0/6 drug resistant), two (8%) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and one (4%) West syndrome (all three were drug-resistant). As compared to the patients with no epilepsy, those with epilepsy were more likely to have MRI findings of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (23% vs. 5%, p=0.0064), and cerebral hemisphere tumors (31% vs. 10%, p=0.0079), but not of the other MRI findings including neurofibromatosis bright objects, or optic gliomas. Three of the six patients with MTS underwent temporal lobectomy with subsequent control of their seizures with confirmation of MTS on pathology in 3/3 and presence of coexisting focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in 2/3. We also have observed three additional patients outside the above study with the association of NF1, MTS, and intractable epilepsy. Epilepsy is relatively common in NF1, often occurs in patients with brain tumors or with MTS which can coexist with FCD, can be associated with multiple types of epilepsy syndromes, and when localization-related is often drug-resistant. Patients with NF1 and MTS can respond to medial temporal lobectomy and may have coexisting medial temporal lobe cortical dysplasia.

28635719	"Neurodevelopmental disorders in children with epilepsy
"	"Neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autistic-spectrum disorders, speech disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, are more prevalent in children with epilepsy compared with the general population. Marked developmental delay and regression of acquired skills are characteristic of epileptic encephalopathies. Conditions, in which neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with the marked epileptiform EEG activity, while clinical epileptic seizures are absent, represent a serious problem. The authors consider the features of epilepsy with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, pseudo-Lennox syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, children autistic epileptiform regression, autosomal-dominant rolandic epilepsy with verbal dispraxy and a combination of epilepsy and subclinical epileptiform EEG activity with developmental dysphasia and ADHD. In addition to the optimization of basic treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), nootropic drugs which do not increase epileptiform activity (hopantenic acid), are recommended.

"	"Report the use of perampanel treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We conducted a prospective study of 13 LGS patients (seven male; mean age, 12.8years) treated with adjunctive perampanel therapy. Perampanel was initiated at 2mg/day and titrated to a median maximum dose of 6mg/day. After a mean follow-up duration of 10.8months (range, 1-24months), nine patients (69.2%) were responders (≥50% reduction in total seizure frequency) and nine (69.2%) were rated by their physician as ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"". Four patients (30.8%) discontinued perampanel due to the lack of efficacy (n=2) and seizure aggravation (n=2). No patients discontinued due to other adverse events (AEs). AEs were reported for six patients (46.2%) and comprised decreased activity/social interaction (n=3), behavior disturbance with agitation (n=2), and/or fatigue (n=2). All AEs became manageable after perampanel dosing was decreased. Improvements in cognitive function and/or behavior were reported for seven patients (53.8%). Introduction of perampanel allowed the dose reduction and/or discontinuation of other treatments in seven patients (53.8%). Perampanel was efficacious and generally well tolerated as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with LGS, supporting further research in this area.

28740620	"Use and cost comparison of clobazam to other antiepileptic drugs for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Background: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with serious injuries due to frequent and severe seizures. Of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) approved for LGS, clobazam is a more recent market entrant, having been approved in October 2011. Recent AED budget impact and cost-effectiveness analyses for LGS suggest that adding clobazam to a health plan formulary may result in decreased medical costs; however, research on clinical and economic outcomes and treatment patterns with these AED treatments in LGS is limited. Objectives: To compare the baseline characteristics and treatment patterns of new initiators of clobazam and other AEDs among LGS patients and compare healthcare utilization and costs before and after clobazam initiation among LGS patients. Methods: A retrospective study of probable LGS patients was conducted using the MarketScan® Commercial, Medicare Supplemental, and Medicaid databases (10/1/2010-3/31/2014). Results: In the Commercial/Medicare Supplemental population, clobazam users were younger, had fewer comorbidities, and more prior AED use than non-clobazam users. In the 12 months pre-treatment initiation, clobazam users had significantly more seizure-related inpatient stays and outpatient visits and higher total seizure-related (P < 0.001) and all-cause (P < 0.001) costs than non-clobazam users. Among clobazam users, when compared to the 12 months pre-clobazam initiation, seizure-related medical utilization and costs were lower in the 12 months post-clobazam initiation (P = 0.004). Total all-cause (P < 0.001) and seizure-related (P = 0.029) costs increased post-clobazam initiation mainly due to the increase in outpatient pharmacy costs. Similar results were observed in the Medicaid population. Conclusions: Baseline results suggest a prescribing preference for clobazam in severe LGS patients. Clobazam users had a reduction in seizure-related medical utilization and costs after clobazam initiation. The improvement in medical costs mostly offset the higher prescription costs following clobazam initiation.

28782435	"Rufinamide pretreatment attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury in the gerbil hippocampus
"	"Rufinamide, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker, is widely used for the clinical treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that VGSC blockers have neuroprotective properties against ischemic damage following experimental cerebral ischemia. However, protective effects of rufinamide against cerebral ischemic insults have not been addressed. Therefore, in the present study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of rufinamide using a gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia. Gerbils were established by the occlusion of common carotid arteries for 5 min. The gerbils were divided into vehicle-treated sham-operated group, vehicle-treated ischemia-operated group, 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated sham-operated groups, and 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated ischemia-operated groups. Rufinamide was administrated intraperitoneally once daily for 3 days before ischemic surgery. To examine neuroprotective effects of rufinamide, we carried out cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence staining. In addition, we examined gliosis using immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (a marker for microglia). We found that pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide effectively protected pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) area after transient global cerebral ischemia. In addition, pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide significantly attenuated activations of astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 area. These findings suggest that rufinamide can display neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic insults and that its neuroprotective effect may involve the attenuation of ischemia-induced glial activation.

28846756	"Prevalence of Pathogenic Copy Number Variation in Adults With Pediatric-Onset Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability
"	"Copy number variation (CNV) is an important cause of neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about the role of CNV in adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability. To evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs and identify possible candidate CNVs and genes in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In this cross-sectional study, genome-wide microarray was used to evaluate a cohort of 143 adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability who were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital epilepsy outpatient clinic from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. The inclusion criteria were (1) pediatric seizure onset with ongoing seizure activity in adulthood, (2) intellectual disability of any degree, and (3) no structural brain abnormalities or metabolic conditions that could explain the seizures. DNA screening was performed using genome-wide microarray platforms. Pathogenicity of CNVs was assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score was used to evaluate genes within the identified CNVs that could play a role in each patient's phenotype. Of the 2335 patients, 143 probands were investigated (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [10.8] years; 69 male and 74 female). Twenty-three probands (16.1%) and 4 affected relatives (2.8%) (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [6.1] years; 11 male and 16 female) presented with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs (0.08-18.9 Mb). Five of the 23 probands with positive results (21.7%) had more than 1 CNV reported. Parental testing revealed de novo CNVs in 11 (47.8%), with CNVs inherited from a parent in 4 probands (17.4%). Sixteen of 23 probands (69.6%) presented with previously cataloged human genetic disorders and/or defined CNV hot spots in epilepsy. Eight nonrecurrent rare CNVs that overlapped 1 or more genes associated with intellectual disability, autism, and/or epilepsy were identified: 2p16.1-p15 duplication, 6p25.3-p25.1 duplication, 8p23.3p23.1 deletion, 9p24.3-p23 deletion, 10q11.22-q11.23 duplication, 12p13.33-13.2 duplication, 13q34 deletion, and 16p13.2 duplication. Five genes are of particular interest given their potential pathogenicity in the corresponding phenotypes and least tolerability to variation: ABAT, KIAA2022, COL4A1, CACNA1C, and SMARCA2. ABAT duplication was associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and KIAA2022 deletion with Jeavons syndrome. The high prevalence of pathogenic CNVs in this study highlights the importance of microarray analysis in adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability. Additional studies and comparison with similar cases are required to evaluate the effects of deletions and duplications that overlap specific genes.

28874317	"Generalized paroxysmal fast activity in EEG: An unrecognized finding in genetic generalized epilepsy
"	"To study generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). GPFA is an electroencephalographic (EEG) finding in patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy consisting of 15-25Hz bifrontally predominant generalized fast activity seen predominantly in sleep. Historically GPFA is linked to epileptic encephalopathy with drug resistant epilepsy and intellectual disability. However, GPFA has been rarely described as an atypical finding in patients with GGE without negative prognostic implication. We report cognitive profile and seizure characteristics in seven patients with GGE and GPFA. The Vanderbilt EMU and EEG reports were searched for the keywords ""idiopathic generalized epilepsy"", ""GPFA""and ""generalized spike and wave discharges (GSWD)"". We reviewed the EEG tracings and the electronic medical records of patients thus identified. The seizure type, frequency, neurological work-up, clinical profile and imaging data were recorded. Awake and sleep states were captured on EEGs of all patients. On EEG tracing review six patients were confirmed to have GSWD and GPFA; one patient had GPFA but no GSWD. All patients had normal cognitive function. Four had a normal brain MRI and one a normal head CT (two were never imaged). None of the patients had tonic seizures. The main seizure type was generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in five patients, absence in two. Age at onset of epilepsy ranged from 4 to 24years. The mean GTC seizure frequency at the time of EEG was 3; two patients were seizure free on two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). GPFA can be an unrecognized electrographic finding in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy. While GPFA remains an important diagnostic EEG feature for epileptic encephalopathy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) it is not specific for this diagnosis. Thus, GPFA may have a spectrum of variable phenotypic expression. The finding of GPFA is not necessarily indicative of unfavorable outcome.

"	"Rufinamide is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged ≥4years. The objective of this study was to provide real-world, long-term data on patients with LGS initiating rufinamide as add-on therapy and patients with LGS receiving other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A Phase IV, noninterventional, multicenter registry study was conducted in patients with LGS aged ≥4years requiring modification to any AED treatment, including initiation of add-on rufinamide therapy. Safety/tolerability was assessed by evaluating treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and efficacy was assessed using a generic seizure frequency scale. A total of 111 patients from 64 sites in 8 European countries were included, of whom 64 initiated rufinamide (""rufinamide"" group) and 21 did not receive rufinamide at any time during the study (""no-rufinamide"" group). Mean ages were 16.1years (rufinamide) and 15.0years (no rufinamide). The median duration of follow-up was >2years (range: 1.3-46.4months). Antiepileptic drug-related TEAEs were reported for 40.6% (rufinamide) and 33.3% (no rufinamide) of patients and led to discontinuation of 7.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The most frequently reported rufinamide-related TEAEs (≥5% patients) were somnolence (7.8%) and decreased appetite (6.3%). There were no unexpected safety/tolerability findings. At month 12, the proportion of patients with improvement in all seizures (""much improved"" or ""very much improved"") was 28.6% (12/42) for the rufinamide group and 14.3% (2/14) for the no-rufinamide group. The study provided valuable information on LGS and its management, and evidence that rufinamide has a consistent and generally favorable safety/tolerability profile when used in routine clinical practice.

"	"Rufinamide (R) is a triazole derivative approved for the management of partial seizures and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, in November 2007. Crystal structure, solid state characterization, drug-excipient compatibility and solubility play a pivotal role in formulation development. This work deals with the crystal structure elucidation of R by single crystal X-ray diffraction and solid state characterization by thermal, spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. Drug- excipient compatibility was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). New RP-HPLC method for quantification of R was developed with improved retention time. Solubility and dissolution of drug in different media was determined. Additionally, the flow behavior of the drug was evaluated by measuring Carr's index and Hausner's ratio, while the compressibility behavior was studied using Well's protocol. R crystallized from dimethylformamide (R-DMF) was utilized for single crystal analysis. The drug crystallized in triclinic crystal system with P-1 space group. Asymmetric unit cell consists of two molecules of R held by intermolecular hydrogen bond (connected by NH⋯O, which forms the catemeric chain). Analytical outcomes from DSC, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed that the drug was present in pure crystalline form and was devoid of any polymorphic or pseudopolymorphic impurities. Influence of pH on the solubility and dissolution of R-DMF was found to be insignificant. The drug exhibited poor aqueous solubility, which was improved nearly 4.6 fold with the addition of 2% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). The drug exhibits poor flow and elastic compression nature. Excipients such as poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, SLS, lactose monohydrate, starch and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E15 were incompatible with R-DMF as identified by thermal analysis. It is envisaged that these information regarding solid state properties of R-DMF would aid in identifying a logical path for formulation development.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood. In the long term, patients with this condition still have intractable seizures, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical comorbidities. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and EEG characteristics of a group of adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with LGS older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years. Median follow-up was 14.4years (range: 2-40). All of our patients had 3 or more seizure types during their clinical history. The most prevalent seizure types at follow-up were atypical absences (28/38), tonic (28/38), generalized tonic-clonic (17/38), focal (11/38), and myoclonic seizures (9/38). All patients had drug-resistant seizures. Besides epilepsy, intellectual disability and behavioral problems were prominent features. Surprisingly, paroxysmal nonepileptic seizures were reported in 3 patients. Our observations confirm the poor outcome of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous West syndrome.

"	"Given the complexities managing Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)-comorbid conditions, multiple associated seizure types that tend to be refractory to treatment-dosage optimization of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is a challenge. In the absence of clinical trial data on optimization of AED dosage in patients with LGS, dose titration is guided by personal experience, anecdotal evidence, and specific patient factors (age, comorbid conditions and medications, seizure types, etc.). The goal of this study was to determine whether a 20% increase in adjunctive clobazam was a reasonable benchmark for improved seizure response in patients with LGS who had responded to adjunctive clobazam treatment during a 12-week lead-in trial. This was a post hoc analysis of data from a long-term, open-label extension (OLE) study, which comprised patients who completed 1 of 2 pivotal clobazam lead-in studies. During the lead-in studies, patients received either placebo or clobazam (0.25, 0.50, or 1.0mg/kg/d) (maximum 40mg/d); during OLE, patients received clobazam up to 2.0mg/kg/d (maximum 80mg/d). The post hoc analysis population comprised patients who had ≥25%, ≥50%, or ≥75% seizure reduction from baseline during lead-in clobazam treatment and ≥12months of follow-up data during OLE. Successful dosage increase (i.e., dosage optimization) was defined as ≥20% clobazam dosage increase from OLE baseline, and improved seizure control from OLE baseline (improvement in seizure responder status, or >50% reduction in total seizure frequency). Patients were stratified by responder status after lead-in treatment (OLE baseline) and by lead-in clobazam dosage received. The findings of the analysis indicated that clobazam dosage increases of ≥20% during long-term treatment improved seizure control >80% of patients with LGS who responded to clobazam during lead-in treatment. Rates of successful dosage increase during OLE were high regardless of lead-in dosage received, with the highest rate of successful dosage increase among patients who received low-dosage clobazam during lead-in. Similarly, rates of successful dose increase were high regardless of lead-in seizure responder category, with the highest rates occurring in patients with the highest (≥75%) lead-in response.

"	"To describe electroclinical features and outcome of 6 patients harboring KCNB1 mutations. Clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, and brain MRI data analysis. Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 95 epilepsy gene panel. The mean age at seizure onset was 11 months. The mean follow-up of 11.3 years documented that 4 patients following an infantile phase of frequent seizures became seizure free; the mean age at seizure offset was 4.25 years. Epilepsy phenotypes comprised West syndrome in 2 patients, infantile-onset unspecified generalized epilepsy, myoclonic and photosensitive eyelid myoclonia epilepsy resembling Jeavons syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and focal epilepsy with prolonged occipital or clonic seizures in each and every one. Five patients had developmental delay prior to seizure onset evolving into severe intellectual disability with absent speech and autistic traits in one and stereotypic hand movements with impulse control disorder in another. The patient with Jeavons syndrome evolved into moderate intellectual disability. Mutations were de novo, 4 missense and 2 nonsense, 5 were novel, and 1 resulted from somatic mosaicism. KCNB1-related manifestations include a spectrum of infantile-onset generalized or focal seizures whose combination leads to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy including West, Lennox-Gastaut, and Jeavons syndromes. Long-term follow-up highlights that following a stormy phase, seizures subside or cease and treatment may be eased or withdrawn. Cognitive and motor functions are almost always delayed prior to seizure onset and evolve into severe, persistent impairment. Thus, KCNB1 mutations are associated with diffuse brain dysfunction combining seizures, motor, and cognitive impairment.

Thirty-three candidate variants were detected after population filtration and computational prediction. According to ACMG, 21 candidate variants, including 18 de novo variants, were assessed to be pathogenic/likely pathogenic with clinical concordance. Twelve variants were initially assessed as uncertain significance by ACMG, among which 3 were considered causative and 3 others were considered possibly causative after analysis of clinical concordance. In total, 24 variants were identified as putatively causative, among which 19 were novel findings. SCN1A mutations were identified in 50% of patients with Dravet syndrome. TSC1/TSC2 mutations were detected in 66.7% of patients with tuberous sclerosis. STXBP1 mutations were the main findings in patients with West syndrome. Mutations in SCN2A, KCNT1, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were identified in patients with epileptic infantile with migrating focal seizures; among them, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were first identified as potential causative genes. Only one CHD2 mutation was detected in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study highlighted the utility of targeted NGS in genetic diagnoses of epileptic encephalopathies and a comprehensive evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants based on ACMG scoring and assessment of clinical concordance. Epileptic encephalopathies differ in genetic causes, and the genotype-phenotype correlations would provide insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

"	"Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a rare, severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, are frequently treatment resistant to available medications. No controlled studies have investigated the use of cannabidiol for patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol as an add-on anticonvulsant therapy in this population of patients. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43·9% (IQR -69·6 to -1·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21·8% (IQR -45·7 to 1·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17·21 (95% CI -30·32 to -4·09; p=0·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment. Add-on cannabidiol is efficacious for the treatment of patients with drop seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is generally well tolerated. The long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol is currently being assessed in the open-label extension of this trial. GW Pharmaceuticals.

It was found that CC caused brain network 'hubs' to shift from paramedian to lateral regions in the good-recovery group, which reorganized the brain network into a more homogeneous state. We also found increased local clustering coefficients in patients with bad outcomes and decreases, implying enhanced network integration, in patients with good outcomes. The small worldness of brain networks in patients with good outcomes increased in the two years after CC, whereas it decreased in patients with bad outcomes. The covariation of small-worldness with the rate of reduction in seizure frequency suggests that this can be used as an indicator of CC outcome. Local and global network changes during the long-term state might be associated with the postoperative recovery process and could serve as indicators for CC outcome and long-term LGS recovery.

"	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in epilepsy has been a topic of increasing interest, which in general occurs in 15-35% of the patients with epilepsy, more frequently in those with intellectual disability (ID). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are two typical forms of intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with ID. We previously reported that ASD was diagnosed in 24.3% of patients with DS, higher in those with profound ID. Given the severe epilepsy and high frequency of ID in LGS, it is necessary to know whether ASD is a common psychomotor co-morbidity of LGS. This study evaluated the autistic behaviors and intelligence in patients with LGS and further compared that between LGS and DS, aiming to understand the complex pathogenesis of epilepsy-ASD-ID triad. A total of 50 patients with LGS and 45 patients with DS were enrolled and followed up for at least 3 years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and evaluations of ASD and ID were performed. No patients with LGS fully met the diagnostic criteria for ASD, but three of them exhibited more or less autistic behaviors. Majority (86%) of LGS patients presented ID, among which moderate to severe ID was the most common. Early onset age and symptomatic etiology were risk predictors for ID. The prevalence of ASD in LGS was significantly lower than that in DS (0/50 vs. 10/45, p < 0.001), while the prevalence and severity of ID showed no significant difference between the two forms of epileptic encephalopathy. This study demonstrated a significant difference in the co-morbidity of ASD between LGS and DS, although they had a similar prevalence and severity of ID, refuting the proposal that the prevalence of ASD in epilepsy is accounted for by ID. These findings suggest that the co-morbidity of ASD, ID, and epilepsy may result from multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms.

"	"Anterior two-thirds corpus callosotomy is a common palliative surgical intervention most commonly employed in patients with atonic or drop seizures. Recently, stereotactic laser ablation of the corpus callosum without a craniotomy has shown promise in achieving similar outcomes with fewer side effects and shorter hospitalizations. The authors demonstrate ablation of the anterior two-thirds corpus callosum in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and drug-resistant drop seizures. Technical nuances of laser ablation with 3 laser fibers are described. Postoperatively, the patient showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency and severity over a 9-month follow-up period.

"	"Cut homeodomain transcription factor CUX2 plays an important role in dendrite branching, spine development, and synapse formation in layer II to III neurons of the cerebral cortex. We identify a recurrent de novo CUX2 p.Glu590Lys as a novel genetic cause for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). The de novo p.Glu590Lys variant was identified by whole-exome sequencing (n = 5) or targeted gene panel (n = 4). We performed electroclinical and imaging phenotyping on all patients. The cohort comprised 7 males and 2 females. Mean age at study was 13 years (0.5-21.0). Median age at seizure onset was 6 months (2 months to 9 years). Seizure types at onset were myoclonic, atypical absence with myoclonic components, and focal seizures. Epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram was seen in 8 cases: generalized polyspike-wave (6) or multifocal discharges (2). Seizures were drug resistant in 7 or controlled with valproate (2). Six patients had a DEE: myoclonic DEE (3), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (2), and West syndrome (1). Two had a static encephalopathy and genetic generalized epilepsy, including absence epilepsy in 1. One infant had multifocal epilepsy. Eight had severe cognitive impairment, with autistic features in 6. The p.Glu590Lys variant affects a highly conserved glutamine residue in the CUT domain predicted to interfere with CUX2 binding to DNA targets during neuronal development. Patients with CUX2 p.Glu590Lys display a distinctive phenotypic spectrum, which is predominantly generalized epilepsy, with infantile-onset myoclonic DEE at the severe end and generalized epilepsy with severe static developmental encephalopathy at the milder end of the spectrum.

"	"Clobazam (CLB) is approved as adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 2 years and older. It is converted to an active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB) by CYP3A4, which is then broken down to an inactive metabolite by CYP2C19. This study characterizes the impact of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 drug interactions on CLB and NCLB serum concentrations (Cp) and concentration/dose (Cp/D) ratios in pediatric patients with epilepsy. This was a retrospective chart review including patients older than 1 month, who received CLB between April 2012 and March 2017. Extracted data included patient demographics, CLB daily dose, CLB and NCLB Cp, calculated CLB and NCLB Cp/Cp and Cp/D ratios, and all concomitant drugs. The study included 995 CLB concentration sets from 302 patients (median age 7.6 years and range 0.2-40.1 years). Pharmacokinetic variability was extensive, as seen by widespread ranges of CLB and NCLB Cp, NCLB/CLB Cp ratio, and 3 Cp/D ratios (CLB, NCLB, and CLB + NCLB). Comedications, described as CYP3A4 inducers and/or CYP2C19 inhibitors (carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, felbamate, (fos)phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, rufinamide, and topiramate), generally increased NCLB/CLB Cp ratio (267%-400%), NCLB Cp/D ratio (167%-202%), and CLB + NCLB Cp/D ratio (142%-185%) and decreased CLB Cp/D ratio (47%-76%) compared with a group of concentration sets in patients receiving only neutral comedications (P < 0.025 for all comparisons). Older age was associated with higher Cp/D ratios (mg/kg), indicative of decreased clearance. Pharmacokinetic variability of CLB in pediatric patients is extensive, and it is influenced by drug-drug interactions and age. Therapeutic drug monitoring of CLB and active metabolite NCLB with calculation of various Cp/Cp and Cp/D ratios can provide useful insight into CLB pharmacokinetics and help differentiate between causes of variability.

"	"To evaluate the clinical impact of ketogenic diet (KD) on children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy. In all, 52 children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy that diagnosed in our hospital from July 2012 to June 2015 were selected, including West syndrome 38 cases, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome 7 cases, Doose Syndrome 1 case, and Dravet syndrome 6 cases, and the effect, compliance, adverse reactions, electroencephalogram (EEG), and cognitive function were analyzed. Modified Johns Hopkins protocol was used to initiate KD, and Engel scale was used to evaluate the effect, and evaluated the effect of KD on the cognition, language, and motor function. At 12 weeks of KD treatment, the patients achieved I, II, III, and IV grade effect were accounted for 26.9% (14/52 cases), 17.3% (9/52 cases), 11.5% (6/52 cases), and 44.2% (23/52 cases), respectively, according to Engel scale. KD has different effect on different epileptic syndromes, best effect on Doose syndromes of 100%, and better effect on West syndrome with the effect rate of 57.9%, and the total effect number was 22 cases. The reduction of epileptiform discharges in the awake state before KD treatment was correlated with the seizure time after 3 months of KD treatment (r = .330, p = .017). The cognitive function of 23 patients was improved, 12 patients had language improvement, and the motor function was improved in 10 patients. In all, 23 patients had adverse reactions, and all patients were tolerated and improved. KD has certain effect on children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, and it can reduce interictal epileptic discharge frequency, and improve the background rhythm of EEG. The reduction of epileptiform discharges in awake state is in favor of the reduction of seizures frequency, thus increasing the efficacy, and improve the cognitive function, language, and motor function to varying degrees, combined with less adverse reaction, which is worthy of clinical application.

"	"Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560 .).

"	"Epilepsy is the most common neurological symptom in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), occurring in 72-85% of affected individuals. Despite the large number of patients reported, their electroclinical phenotype has been rarely described. We analyzed seizure semiology through ictal video-electroencephalography (V-EEG) recordings in a large series of patients. In this multicenter study, we reviewed V-EEGs of 51 patients: ictal recordings were analyzed in correlation with their clinical variables. The median age of epilepsy onset was six months (one day-16 years), with onset in the first year of life in 71% patients (36/51), in 10 of them during the neonatal period. Sixty-five percent of patients (33/51) experienced epileptic spasms in their life, with late-onset (>two years) in five; 42% of the epileptic spasms persisted after age two years, despite the onset in the first year of life. We identified four different electroclinical subsets: focal epilepsy (35%, 18/51), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome evolution (27%, 14/51), focal seizures with persisting spasms (33%, 17/51), and spasms only (4%, 2/51). We reviewed 45 focal seizures, 13 clusters of epileptic spasms, and seven generalized seizures. In 12 patients, we recorded different seizure types. In 71% of the focal seizures (32/45), the ictal pattern was focal without diffusion. In 38% of the patients (5/13) epileptic spasms were related to typical diffuse slow wave pattern associated with superimposed fast activity, with focal predominance. Focal seizures and focal spasms resulted as the most frequent seizure types in TSC. Seizure onset was variable but showing a predominant involvement of the frontocentral regions (40%). Discrete clinical signs characterized the seizures, and behavioral arrest was the predominant first clinical objective sign. Epileptic spasms were a typical presentation at all ages, frequently asymmetrical and associated with lateralizing features, especially in older patients.

"	"Fenfluramine is being developed as a low-dose adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome and other epileptic encephalopathies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Most patients with Dravet syndrome receive multiple antiepileptic drugs, making it challenging for caregivers to track correct administration times. The present Phase I study was conducted to determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic properties of fenfluramine. Healthy nonsmoking subjects aged 18 to 50 years were enrolled in an open-label, crossover, Phase I pharmacokinetic and safety profile study and received 2 single 0.8-mg/kg doses of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride oral solution), 1 after a 10-hour overnight fast and the other 30 minutes after the start of consumption of a high-fat breakfast, in a randomly assigned order. A washout period of at least 9 days separated the 2 treatment periods. Venous blood samples were taken before each dose and periodically for 72 hours after each dose for determination of concentrations of fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for each subject by noncompartmental analysis. In the 13 subjects completing both treatment periods, food had no effect on the rate or extent of absorption and bioavailability of fenfluramine as assessed by fed vs fasted adjusted geometric mean observed plasma Cmax (59.1 vs 56.7 ng/mL; NS) and AUC0-∞ (1640 vs 1600 ng · h/mL; NS). Additionally, there was no impact of food on systemic exposure of norfenfluramine. Seven subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event; all treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in severity. The bioequivalence and tolerability of single 0.8-mg/kg oral doses of ZX008 in the fed and fasted states support ZX008 administration without regard to meals.

"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a structurally unique anti-epileptic drug, used in the treatment of seizure disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the present study, we investigated whether RUF protected against excitotoxic neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region after intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection. Treatment with 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg RUF significantly decreased the KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA3 region in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 100 mg/kg RUF treatment reduced the KA-induced oxidative stress-related increase of MDA level and decrease of total SOD activity in the hippocampus. KA-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, levels as well as KA-induced microglial activation were also suppressed by RUF treatment. These results indicate that RUF displays a neuroprotective effect against KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

"	"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is still a significant cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, mental delay, and epilepsy. After the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia, the prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has improved, with reduction of death and disabilities. However, few studies evaluated whether hypothermia affects rate and severity of postneonatal epilepsy. We evaluated rates, characteristics and prognostic markers of postneonatal epilepsy in infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated or not with therapeutic hypothermia. We analyzed clinical data, EEG recordings, cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and outcome in 23 cooled and 26 non-cooled asphyxiated neonates (≥36 weeks' gestation), admitted from 2004 to 2012. Among 49 neonates 11 (22%) had postneonatal epilepsy, of which 9 (18%) were non-cooled and 2 (4%) were cooled (P=0.05). Six of 11 infants (55%) had West syndrome, 4 (36%) had focal epilepsy and 1 (9%) had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. At multiple logistic regression analysis MRI pattern significantly correlated with postneonatal epilepsy (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.88, P=0.03). Extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter were associated with postneonatal epilepsy. Only perinatal asphyxia with extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter lesion conveys a high risk for early and severe postneonatal epilepsy. Moreover, therapeutic hypothermia is associated with a decrease of the risk of developing postneonatal epilepsy.

"	"Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative treatment for medically intractable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that disrupts the interhemispheric synchronization of epileptiform discharges. However, traditional open corpus callosotomy carries a significant risk of surgical complications associated with craniotomy and a parafalcine approach to the corpus callosum. Here, we report 2 cases of anterior corpus callosotomy using MRI-guided stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) as a minimally invasive technique for mitigating the risks of craniotomy while achieving favorable outcomes. Two patients with medically intractable LGS underwent stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy using a 2 laser-fiber approach. Ablation of 70%-80% of the corpus callosum was confirmed by postoperative MRI diffusion tensor imaging and volumetric analysis. Marked reduction of epileptiform activity was observed in both patients during postoperative video-EEG studies as compared to preoperative video-EEG studies. Freedom from disabling seizures including drop attacks was achieved in 1 patient for 18 mo, and more than a 90% reduction of disabling seizures was achieved in the other patient for 7 mo with cognitive improvement and without surgical complications. These early data demonstrate the technical feasibility, safety, and favorable outcomes of MRI-guided stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy in patients with LGS, making it a potentially safe and effective alternative to traditional open corpus callosotomy and other stereotactic methods including radiofrequency ablation and radiosurgery due to the ability to monitor the ablation in real time with MRI.

"	"Objective: We examined the short-term efficacy and safety of rufinamide (RFN) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of clinical records of patients with LGS who started RFN treatment between July 2013 and June 2014 at the Hokkaido Medical Center for Child Health and Rehabilitation and Midorigaoka Ryo-iku-en. Efficacy and safety were evaluated when the patients had completed three months of treatment. Patients were classified into four categories according to percent seizure reduction : remission (seizure-free), response (seizure reduction≥50%), no change (seizure reduction<50% or increase) and aggravation (seizure increase≥50%). Responder rate (RR) was the percentage of patients with≥50% decrease in seizure frequency. Results: Thirteen LGS patients (8 males, 5 females) were studied. The efficacy for tonic seizures (13 patients) was remission 1 patient, response 3 patients, no change 8 patients and aggravation 1 patient, with RR of 30.8%. Two patients discontinued LGS due to seizure aggravation. Four patients experienced transient remission. For generalized tonic clonic seizures (2 patients), 1 patient achieved remission and 1 patient showed no change. Two patients of atonic seizures showed no change. Of 2 patients of atypical absence, 1 patient showed response and 1 patient no change. Eight patients had adverse effects such as somnolence (6 patients), sleep disturbance (1 patient), and appetite loss (4 patients) including weight loss in 2 patients. There were no severe adverse effects and no discontinuation due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Short-term effectiveness for tonic seizures was observed when patients with LGS were treated with RFN, with transient remission in some patients. We consider that RFN is worth trying in patients with LGS due to its efficacy for tonic seizures and absence of severe adverse effects.

"	"Multifocal epileptic activity is an unfavourable feature of a number of epileptic syndromes (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome, severe focal epilepsies) which suggests an overall vulnerability of the brain to pathological synchronization. However, the mechanisms of multifocal activity are insufficiently understood. This explorative study investigates whether pathological connectivity within brain areas of the default mode network as well as thalamus, brainstem and retrosplenial cortex may predispose individuals to multifocal epileptic activity. 33 children suffering from multifocal and monofocal (control group) epilepsies were investigated using EEG-fMRI recordings during sleep. The blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal of 15 regions of interest was extracted and temporally correlated (resting-state functional connectivity). Patients with monofocal epilepsies were characterized by strong correlations between the corresponding interhemispheric homotopic regions. This pattern of correlations with pronounced short-distance and weak long-distance functional connectivity resembles the connectivity pattern described for healthy children. Patients with multifocal epileptic activity, however, demonstrated significantly stronger correlations between a large number of regions of the default mode network as well as thalamus and brainstem, with a significant increase in long-distance connectivity compared to children with monofocal epileptic activity. In the group of patients with multifocal epilepsies there were no differences in functional connectivity between patients with or without Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This explorative study shows that multifocal activity is associated with generally increased long-distance functional connectivity in the brain. It can be suggested that this pronounced connectivity may represent either a risk to pathological over-synchronization or a consequence of the multifocal epileptic activity.

ZX008 (fenfluramine HCl oral solution) was well tolerated and reduced seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome, prompting this phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study of add-on ZX008 in patients with LGS (NCT02655198). Eligible treatment-refractory patients with LGS aged 3-18 years with ≥4 documented convulsive seizures (CS) in the prior 4 weeks were administered adjunctive ZX008 twice daily at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/d, with incremental dose escalations up to 0.8 mg/kg/d or 30 mg/d (maximum dose) every 4 weeks in nonresponders (<50% reduction in CS frequency). After 20 weeks (core study), responders were offered entry into a long-term extension study. Seizures were captured via diary. Cardiac safety was monitored by Doppler echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Thirteen patients were enrolled (mean age = 11.7 years, range = 3-17). Ten (77%) patients completed 20 weeks of ZX008 treatment. During the core study, there was a 53% median reduction (N = 13) in CS; median reduction was 60% in the 10 completers. Eight patients (62%) had a ≥50% CS reduction; three (23%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. Nine (69%) patients entered the long-term extension study. At 15 months (n = 9), median reduction in CS was 58%; six (67%) patients had a ≥50% reduction, and three (33%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (n = 4, 31%) and decreased alertness (n = 2, 15%). No echocardiographic signs of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension were observed. ZX008 provided clinically meaningful reduction (≥50%) in CS frequency in the majority of patients with LGS in this pilot study and was generally well tolerated.

30194277	"Long-term Outcome of Resective Epilepsy Surgery in Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
"	"We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcome of resective epilepsy surgery in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We reviewed the case reports of 90 patients with LGS who had undergone resective surgery between 2003 and 2014 at the Severance Children's Hospital and managed them for a minimum period of 2 years. At the time of surgery, the patients were between 3.0 and 23.5 years old (mean ± SD: 9.3 ± 4.4). The time from seizure onset to surgery ranged from 0.7 to 20.1 years (7.2 ± 4.3). On postoperative follow-up for an average period of 6.1 ± 2.2 years (range: 2.1-11.4 years), 45 patients (50.0%) had no seizures, and 15 (16.7%) reported infrequent seizures. Seizure-free outcomes were achieved in 15 of the 21 (71.4%) hemispherectomies, 23 of the 51 (45.1%) multilobar resections, and 7 of the 18 (38.9%) single lobar resections. On high-resolution MRIs, 20 patients (22.2%) had negative findings, 8 of whom (40.0%) became seizure-free after resective surgery. Malformation of cortical development was the most common pathologic finding and was noted in 57 patients (63.3%). Seizure-free patients achieved better adaptive behavior and social competence than did patients with persistent seizures at the second (2-3 years after surgery) and third (4-6 years after surgery) follow-ups, as indicated by social quotients (P < .05). Resective surgery is a viable option in some patients to treat seizures that are associated with LGS, with a high probability of seizure control and better adaptive function.

30213680	"Vagal Nerve Stimulation: Indications for Revision in Adult Refractory Epilepsy
"	"The goal of this study was to assess the indications of revision for vagal nerve stimulation at a single institution in an adult population with drug-resistant epilepsy. This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database who underwent vagal nerve stimulator implantation for drug-resistant epilepsy during 1992-2017. Patients receiving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) implants were monitored throughout their perioperative and postoperative course and were classified according to type of seizure at the time of diagnosis and indications for VNS revision. In addition, response to dysfunctional VNS devices or adverse effects were noted. Most patients receiving VNS implants were given a diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPSs) before implantation (95.1%). Other epileptic conditions identified requiring implantation included generalized seizures, generalized-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, CPS or generalized seizures, and tuberous sclerosis (with generalized characteristics). High lead impedance was the most common indication for revision (5.6%), whereas device ineffectiveness leading to continued seizures was the most common indication for removal (2.3%). Infection, lead fracture, and dual- to single-pin lead battery changes occurred at an incidence of 1.9%, requiring either implant removal or revision. Other events that occurred, albeit rarely, included skin extrusion (0.5%), postoperative hematoma (0.5%), and implant rejection (0.5%) necessitating removal. VNS implantation in adults was shown to be a well-tolerated procedure. In addition, indications for revision or removal of the VNS device was low in this population with lead fracture rates lower than the incidence reported in pediatric population literature.

30286391	"Diagnosis switching and outcomes in a cohort of patients with potential epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures
"	"There is overlap in the electroclinical features of many childhood epilepsy syndromes, especially those presenting with multiple seizure types, such as epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). This study aimed to determine the frequency of diagnosis switching and the factors influencing epilepsy syndrome diagnosis in a cohort of children with possible EMAS, as well as to explore the relationship between epilepsy syndrome diagnoses, key electroclinical features, and clinically relevant outcomes. This is a cross-sectional retrospective chart review of children treated at the Children's Hospital of Colorado with a potential diagnosis of EMAS. There were 77 patients that met eligibility criteria, including 39% (n = 30) with an initial diagnosis of EMAS and 74% (n = 57) with a final diagnosis of EMAS. On average, for the 65% of patients who received more than one epilepsy diagnosis, the first, second, and third diagnoses were received within one year, three years, and ten years after epilepsy onset, respectively. Final diagnosis was significantly related to obtaining at least a six-month period of seizure freedom, p = 0.03. Classic LGS traits, including paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike-and-wave, and tonic seizures were present in 50% of the overall cohort, although a minority of these patients had a final diagnosis of LGS. However, the presence of more LGS traits was associated with a higher likelihood of ongoing seizures. Adjusted for age of epilepsy onset, seizure freedom was half as likely for every additional LGS trait observed (0.49[0.31, 0.77], p = 0.002). Current epilepsy syndrome classification has reduced applicability due to overlapping features. This results in diagnosis switching and limited prognostic value for patients with an overlapping clinical phenotype. Future studies should attempt to stratify patients based not only on epilepsy syndrome diagnosis, but also on the presence of various electroclinical traits to more accurately predict outcome.

"	"The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of sulthiame as an add-on treatment in 44 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) refractory to other antiepileptic drugs and/or non-pharmacological treatment. Patients were selected according to the following criteria: (1) age 4 years or older, (2) a diagnosis of LGS refractory to at least four previous antiepileptic drugs, alone or in combination. Neurologic examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and repeated prolonged electroencephalography (EEG) or video-EEG studies were performed in all cases. Data on school achievements and/or neuropsychological evaluations were obtained during the follow-up of 1-3 years. Sulthiame was added in doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg/kg/day. Twenty-seven of 44 patients (61%) who received sulthiame as add-on therapy had a greater than 50% seizure decrease after a mean follow-up period of 20 months. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in one patient (2%). Four patients (9%) had a 25-50% seizure decrease, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in 12 (25%), and was increased in one (2%). Hyperpnoea and dyspnoea were observed in four patients, and nausea, drowsiness, and headache were seen in one patient each; however, these manifestations were transient and discontinuation of sulthiame was not necessary. Two other patients had decreased appetite, skin rash, and irritability. The adverse effects were mild and transient in these nine cases. Sulthiame as an adjunctive therapy achieved a more than 50% seizure reduction in 27 of 44 patients with LGS with only mild or moderate adverse effects.

"	"Evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and behavioral effects of adjunctive rufinamide in pediatric patients (≥1 to <4 years old) with inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Study 303 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01405053) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial. Patients were randomized (2:1) to oral suspension rufinamide (≤45 mg/kg/day) or any other investigator-chosen antiepileptic drug (AED) for a 2-year treatment period. Primary safety/tolerability assessments included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs. Behavioral effects were assessed via the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) using the Total Problems score and change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems score. CBCL subscores were also evaluated. The Safety Analysis Set included 37 patients (rufinamide: n = 25; any other AED: n = 12). TEAE incidence was similar between the rufinamide (88.0%) and any-other-AED groups (83.3%); serious TEAE incidence was also similar between treatment groups (40.0% and 41.7%, respectively). Between treatment groups, the difference in the least squares mean CBCL Total Problems score across time was not significant (p = 0.7083), behavior outcomes were similar across all endpoints, and there were no consistent trends in CBCL subscores. Long-term (2 years) adjunctive rufinamide was well tolerated in pediatric patients with LGS. Behavioral outcomes were comparable between the rufinamide and any-other-AED groups, however the small sample size and difficulties assessing behavior in this population should be noted. The challenges of this study raise the issue of revising how studies in very young children with rare and complex epilepsies are performed.

Dose periods were 17 days apart. Blood samples were obtained for 72 hours after drug administration and used to calculate non-compartmental PK parameters. Statistical bioequivalence-type analysis demonstrated ZX008 had no significant impact on the PK of any drug in the STP regimen, while the STP regimen moderately affected FFA PK. The 3-drug combination increased the geometric mean Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf of FFA while reducing the Cmax and AUC0-t of its major metabolite, norfenfluramine (norFFA). Adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate and resolved spontaneously. ZX008 + STP regimen co-administration to healthy adult subjects modestly impacted the number but not severity of AEs. Results show that the STP regimen had a moderate impact on FFA and norFFA PK and ZX008 had no significant impact on the 3 STP regimen drugs. ZX008 would not be expected to alter the clinical response of patients to this regimen by means of an effect on PK. When administering these drugs together, a downward dose adjustment of ZX008 may be warranted. .

The conference provided a forum for professionals involved in basic science, clinical research, regulatory affairs, and clinical care to meet and discuss the latest advances related to discovery and development of drugs and devices aimed at improving the management of people with epilepsy. This progress report provides a summary of findings on investigational compounds for which data from both preclinical studies and studies in patients were presented. The compounds reviewed include anakinra, cannabidiol, cannabidivarin, fenfluramine, ganaxolone, medium-chain fatty acids, padsevonil, and the valproic derivatives valnoctamide and sec-butylpropylacetamide. On June 25, 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a standardized formulation of cannabidiol oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years and older. The report shows that there continues to be a steady flow of potential antiepileptic drugs progressing to clinical development. Many of these compounds show innovative mechanisms of action, and some have already been tested in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials, with promising efficacy and safety results.

"	"Fifty million people are affected by epilepsy. Up to 30% are not controlled with the aid of antiepileptic drugs. The vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is a therapeutic alternative that must be taken into account. To determine the effect of the VNS in a cohort of paediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. A retrospective study of children with a VNS implanted between 2008 and 2017 in a tertiary hospital. Epidemiological, aetiological, clinical and electrophysiological data, along with VNS parameters were analysed. The study included 35 patients, with a mean age when the VNS was implanted of 12.84 years (range: 3.1-18.7 years) and a mean time between onset of epilepsy and implantation of 7.2 years (range: 1.3-17.7 years). The causation was structural in 62.9% of cases. The most frequent epileptic conditions were: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and focal epilepsy, with a predominance of tonic seizures (57.1%). The video electroencephalogram showed multifocal anomalies (54%) and a pattern of epileptic encephalopathies (34.3%). Intellectual disability was associated in 94% of the cases. The mean of previous antiepileptic drugs was 9.6 ± 3 (range: 4-16). 43% responded to treatment (>= 50% reduction in number of seizures), with a mean reduction of 67.3%, which improved with higher ages of onset of epilepsy. Three patients were seizure-free (8.5%). The number of seizures decreased by 33% at six months and by 47.4% at 24 months. There was also a notable degree of cognitive (57%) and behavioural improvement (53%). In 28% of cases there were some side effects, but in general they were mild. The VNS is a valid option in refractory epilepsy, with improvements not only in terms of seizures but also regarding cognitive-behavioural aspects, this being very important for the paediatric population.

"	"Neurological therapeutics have been hampered by its inability to advance beyond symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders into the realm of actual palliation, arrest or reversal of the attendant pathological processes. While cannabis-based medicines have demonstrated safety, efficacy and consistency sufficient for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges remain. This review will examine the intriguing promise that recent discoveries regarding cannabis-based medicines offer to neurological therapeutics by incorporating the neutral phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and cannabis terpenoids in the putative treatment of five syndromes, currently labeled recalcitrant to therapeutic success, and wherein improved pharmacological intervention is required: intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current basic science and clinical investigations support the safety and efficacy of such interventions in treatment of these currently intractable conditions, that in some cases share pathological processes, and the plausibility of interventions that harness endocannabinoid mechanisms, whether mediated via direct activity on CB1 and CB2 (tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, caryophyllene), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ; THCA), 5-HT1A (CBD, CBDA) or even nutritional approaches utilizing prebiotics and probiotics. The inherent polypharmaceutical properties of cannabis botanicals offer distinct advantages over the current single-target pharmaceutical model and portend to revolutionize neurological treatment into a new reality of effective interventional and even preventative treatment.

Areas covered: 1,4-disubstituted triazole ring formed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction is an important structural motif widely used to construct diverse chemotypes in chemical, biological, and material fields. 1,2,3-triazole ring containing rufinamide, an antiepileptic drug developed by Novartis, is useful in combination with other antiepileptic medicaments for the treatment of childhood-onset epilepsy known as LGS. There are numerous synthetic methods used to construct the rufinamide through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The application claims processes for the preparation of rufinamide and their intermediates. The synthetic strategy covered for the synthesis of rufinamide using activated acetylenic esters. The activation is done using N-hydroxy succinimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, 1-hydroxy benzotriazole, and 4-nitro phenol. Expert opinion: The manufacturing route appears to follow the regioselective Cu catalyzed cycloaddtion of 2,6-difluro benzyl azide with or without isolated activated acetylenic esters in three steps that provide a good lead for new synthetic strategy for the rufinamide synthesis.

"	"The complex clinical presentation and progression of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can complicate the accurate diagnosis of this severe, lifelong, childhood-onset epilepsy, often resulting in suboptimal treatment. The Refractory Epilepsy Screening Tool for LGS (REST-LGS) was developed to improve the identification of patients with LGS. Using the Modified Delphi Consensus, a group of experts developed and tested the REST-LGS Case Report Form (CRF) comprising 8 criteria (4 major, 4 minor) considered potentially indicative of LGS. Diagnosis-blinded specialist and nonspecialist raters at 2 epilepsy centers applied the CRF to deidentified patient records, including 1:1 records of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy or confirmed LGS. Interrater reliability was measured by Cohen's κ. Diagnosis was then unblinded to reveal common criteria for LGS or drug-resistant epilepsy. Cronbach's α was used to measure internal consistency between raters for all criteria combined. Of 200 patients, 81% to 85% met 1 to 3 major criteria. At both sites, moderate (κ, 0.41-0.60) to good (κ, 0.61-0.80) agreement on most criteria was reached between expert and nonexpert raters. Unblinding revealed that most patients with LGS met 3 major and 2 to 3 minor criteria, while patients with drug-resistant epilepsy met ≤1 major and only 1 to 2 minor criteria. Cronbach's α of raters at both sites was 0.64. The combined number of major/minor criteria on the CRF may be particularly indicative of LGS. Therefore, the REST-LGS may be a valuable clinical tool in identifying patients requiring further diagnostic evaluation for LGS.

Patient characteristics were reviewed, and associations between clinical factors and outcomes after the treatment were analyzed. The proportion of individuals with mitochondrial disease with LGS with a history of West syndrome was 32.5%. Among the patients with mitochondrial disease with LGS, neonatal seizure (p=0.029), seizure as the first symptom (p=0.018), and generalized paroxysmal fast activity frequency on electroencephalogram (p=0.018) in the group with a history of West syndrome were statistically significantly high.

Prolonged video-EEG monitoring recorded seizures and generalized interictal epileptiform discharges in all. All patients had drug-resistant epilepsy (range of antiseizure drugs tried, 7-16). Two patients had a history of intrathecal methotrexate to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two patients had malformations of cortical development. CSF analysis (n = 5) showed a mild elevation in the protein level without other abnormalities.

Relevant information was identified through EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2018). Product labeling and https://www.clinicaltrials.gov were also reviewed. English language articles evaluating efficacy and safety in humans with treatment-resistant epilepsies were reviewed; additional pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies in humans, animals, and in vitro were also included. Pure, plant-based CBD is a pharmaceutical grade extract that exhibits clinically significant antiseizure properties, with a hypothesized multimodal mechanism of action. In the GWPCARE trial series, CBD displayed superior efficacy in reducing key seizure frequencies (convulsive seizures in DS; drop seizures in LGS) by 17% to 23% compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs in patients 2 years of age and older. Common adverse effects were somnolence, diarrhea, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Noteworthy drug-drug interactions included clobazam, valproates, and significant inducers/inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 enzymes. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: A discussion regarding CBD dosing, administration, adverse effects, monitoring parameters, and interactions is provided to guide clinicians. CBD offers patients with DS and LGS a new treatment option for refractory seizures. This is the first cannabis-derived medication with approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Herein we present an interim analysis of the safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes from this trial. Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD oral solution (Epidiolex; 100 mg/mL), titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg/d over a 2-week titration period, in addition to their existing medications. Doses could be reduced if not tolerated or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d if thought to be of benefit. This interim analysis was based on a November 2016 data cut. Of 368 patients who completed treatment in GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4, 366 (99.5%) enrolled in the OLE study (GWPCARE5). Median treatment duration was 38 weeks at a mean modal dose of 23 mg/kg/d. Most patients (92.1%) experienced adverse events (AEs), primarily of mild (32.5%) or moderate (43.4%) severity. The most common AEs were diarrhea (26.8%), somnolence (23.5%), and convulsion (21.3%). Thirty-five patients (9.6%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Liver transaminase elevations were reported in 37 patients (10.1%), of whom 29 were receiving concomitant valproic acid; 34 cases resolved spontaneously or with dose modification of CBD or concomitant medication. Median reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency (quantified monthly over 12-week periods) ranged from 48% to 60% through week 48. Median reduction in monthly total seizure frequency ranged from 48% to 57% across all 12-week periods through week 48. Eighty-eight percent of patients/caregivers reported an improvement in the patient's overall condition per the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale. In this study, long-term add-on CBD treatment had an acceptable safety profile in patients with LGS and led to sustained reductions in seizures.

"	"This is a prospective study of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome receiving clobazam as adjunctive therapy. This pilot study aims to examine medication effectiveness as it relates to seizure reduction, as well as improvement in parent-reported behavior and quality of life (QOL). Ten patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome aged 3-11 years were enrolled in this 6-week, 4 phase study. Seizure frequency, QOL, and Aberrant Behavior Checklist questionnaires were evaluated at 0, 2, 6, and 10 weeks during the study. Patients showed improvement on indices of QOL, including physical activities (62.5%), well-being (37.5%), cognition (87.5%), social activities (37.5%), behavior (87.5%), general health (50%), and overall QOL (87.5%). The Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) questionnaire revealed significant improvement in cognition (P = .008), social activities (P = .049), behavior (P = .038), and overall QOL (P = .018). The Aberrant Behavior Checklist exhibited a trend toward improvement in hyperactivity. There was improvement in all patients with documented baseline seizures (8/10), with 5 showing significant improvement (95%-100% reduction) and 3 showing minor improvement (7%-23% reduction). Statistically significant improvement in areas of cognition, social activities, behavior, and overall QOL were seen. An overall trend toward a positive well-being was seen in our patients with clobazam, as adjunct therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children.

"	"Effect of Cannabidiol on Drop Seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Devinsky O, Patel AD, Cross JH, et al; GWPCARE3 Study Group. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1888-1897. Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2-55 years) who had had 2 or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg/kg (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in 2 equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group ( P = .005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group, and P = .002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560.) Long-Term Safety and Treatment Effects of Cannabidiol in Children and Adults With Treatment-Resistant Epilepsies: Expanded Access Program Results Szaflarski JP, Bebin EM, Comi AM, et al; CBD EAP Study Group. Epilepsia. 2018;59(8):1540-1548. Since 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded access program (EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP patients treated through December 2016. Twenty-five US-based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2 to 10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2 to 4 weeks through 16 weeks and every 2 to 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy end points included the percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency and percentage of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in seizures versus baseline. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for missing data. Adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit. Of 607 patients in the safety data set, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most common reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was 13 years (range, 0.4-62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0-10). Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add-on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by 48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%). Results from this ongoing EAP support previous observational and clinical trial data, showing that add-on CBD may be an efficacious long-term treatment option for TRE. Randomized, Dose-Ranging Safety Trial of Cannabidiol in Dravet Syndrome Devinsky O, Patel AD, Thiele EA, et al; GWPCARE1 Part A Study Group. Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1204-e1211. To evaluate the safety and preliminary pharmacokinetics of a pharmaceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol (CBD) in children with Dravet syndrome. Patients aged 4 to 10 years were randomized 4:1 to CBD (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d) or placebo taken twice daily. The double-blind trial comprised 4-week baseline, 3-week treatment (including titration), 10-day taper, and 4-week follow-up periods. Completers could continue in an open-label extension. Multiple pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken on the first day of dosing and at end of treatment for measurement of CBD, its metabolites 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; clobazam and metabolite N-desmethylclobazam [N-CLB], valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol). Safety assessments were clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse events (AEs), seizure frequency, and suicidality. Thirty-four patients were randomized (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups and 7 to placebo); 32 (94%) completed treatment. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites was dose proportional (AUC0-t). Cannabidiol did not affect concomitant AED levels, apart from an increase in N-CLB (except in patients taking stiripentol). The most common AEs on CBD were pyrexia, somnolence, decreased appetite, sedation, vomiting, ataxia, and abnormal behavior. Six patients taking CBD and valproate developed elevated transaminases; none met criteria for drug-induced liver injury and all recovered. No other clinically relevant safety signals were observed. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites increased proportionally with dose. An interaction with N-CLB was observed, likely related to CBD inhibition of cytochrome P450 subtype 2C19. Cannabidiol resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated. This study provides class I evidence that for children with Dravet syndrome, CBD resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.

Electrocorticography is a useful tool to guide the localization of the epileptogenic focus for surgical resection in epilepsy surgery. Drug interactions, proconvulsant or anticonvulsant activity of the anesthetics, and anesthetic influence on intraoperative electrocorticography are the primary concerns to be addressed in these patients. We observed that dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia facilitates intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring. Dexmedetomidine, by decreasing the requirements of other anesthetic agents, offers better recovery profile and pain relief with minimal respiratory depression in patients undergoing disconnective epilepsy surgeries.

"	"Since 2014, patients with severe treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) have been receiving add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in an ongoing, expanded access program (EAP), which closely reflects clinical practice. We conducted an interim analysis of long-term efficacy and tolerability in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) who received CBD treatment through December 2016. Children and adults with LGS/DS taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included from 25 EAP sites across the United States. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD (Epidiolex®; 100 mg/mL) in oral solution at 2-10 mg/kg/day, titrated until tolerability limit or a maximum dose of 25-50 mg/kg/day. Patient visits were every 2-4 weeks. The percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive (ie, major motor) and total seizures was evaluated at 12-week intervals through 96 weeks. The percentages of patients who had ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reduction in monthly seizures relative to the baseline period were also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and summarized for the safety analysis set (SAS) through 144 weeks. Of the 607 patients in the SAS, 58 had DS and 94 had LGS (N = 152); 455 patients had other TREs. Twenty-eight percent of LGS/DS patients withdrew, primarily owing to lack of efficacy (20%). LGS/DS patients were taking a median of 3 (0-10) concomitant AEDs. Median treatment duration was 78.3 (range, 4.1-146.4) weeks. Between weeks 12 and 96, median CBD dose ranged from 21 to 25 mg/kg/day. At 12 weeks, add-on CBD reduced median monthly major motor seizures by 50% and total seizures by 44%, with consistent reductions in both seizure types through 96 weeks. At 12 weeks, the proportions of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in major motor seizures were 53%, 23%, and 6%; the proportions with corresponding reductions in total seizures were 46%, 26%, and 5%. Responder rates for both seizure types were consistent through 96 weeks. CBD had an acceptable safety profile; the most common AEs were somnolence (30%) and diarrhea (24%). Results from this interim analysis support add-on CBD as an effective long-term treatment option in LGS or DS.

31082204	"Evaluation of Selective 5-HT2C  Agonists in Acute Seizure Models
"	"The 5-HT releaser/reuptake inhibitor fenfluramine has been recently reported to provide benefit as an adjunctive treatment for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two types of severe childhood epilepsy. Despite its enhancement of 5-HT function, many effects of fenfluramine have been demonstrated to be dependent on 5-HT2C receptor activation, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptor activation may have an anticonvulsant property. The present study was designed to evaluate fenfluramine and 5-HT agonists of varying 5-HT2C agonist selectivity, the relatively nonselective mCPP and Ro 60-0175, and the selective 5-HT2C agonists lorcaserin and CP-809101 across a variety of acute seizure tests conducted in adult rats and mice, which have been instrumental in identifying the majority of clinically efficacious antiepileptic drugs. Tests included the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), MES threshold, and 6 Hz electrical convulsive seizure models and the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole test. The effect of mCPP, lorcaserin, and CP-809101 against electrically evoked seizures in amygdala kindled rats was also investigated. Overall, at doses known to interact with 5-HT2CR, there was no clear class-related effect of these agonists in any test. The only notable antiseizure effect of fenfluramine was inhibition of MES-induced tonic seizures in the rat. The current preclinical studies using the classical acute seizure tests and an amygdala kindling model do not identify a reliable antiseizure effect of fenfluramine, an agent now used in the treatment of human epilepsies, including Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Given the nature of these epilepsies, early life and/or genetic models may have better construct validity and be more appropriate for further study.

Patients with infantile spasms were identified via the neurophysiology database. Charts were reviewed with attention to infantile spasms diagnosis, presence of trisomy 21, age of reported clinical onset, treatment lag, treatments used, response to treatment, imaging findings, electroencephalography (EEG) data, and developmental outcomes. Of the 310 patients with infantile spasms, 24 also had trisomy 21. Three patients did not meet inclusion criteria. Ten of the 21 patients received nonstandard therapies first line; 2 of the 10 (20%) achieved spasm control, and 4 of the 8 who failed therapy (50%) progressed to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eleven of the 21 patients received standard therapies as first-line treatments (10 with prednisolone according to the protocol in the United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study [UKISS] and 1 with adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACTH]). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) who received prednisolone achieved spasm resolution, 6 (60%) of these without relapse. The final patient (10%) failed prednisolone as well as ACTH. One patient received ACTH first line with success. This is the only series to follow children with trisomy 21 and infantile spasms in which a significant proportion received UKISS-protocol prednisolone. It adds to current knowledge about safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of prednisolone in this group.

"	"Currently, there is a great interest in the potential medical use of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid. Productive pharmacological research on CBD occurred in the 1970s and intensified recently with many discoveries about the endocannabinoid system. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies led to FDA-approval of Epidiolex®, a purified CBD medicine formulated for oral administration for the treatment of infantile refractory epileptic syndromes, by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018. The World Health Organization considers rescheduling cannabis and cannabinoids. CBD use around the world is expanding for diseases that lack scientific evidence of the drug's efficacy. Preclinical and clinical studies also report adverse effects (AEs) and toxicity following CBD intake. Relevant studies reporting CBD's AEs or toxicity were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE through January 2019. Studies defining CBD's beneficial effects were included to provide balance in estimating risk/benefit. CBD is not risk-free. In animals, CBD AEs included developmental toxicity, embryo-fetal mortality, central nervous system inhibition and neurotoxicity, hepatocellular injuries, spermatogenesis reduction, organ weight alterations, male reproductive system alterations, and hypotension, although at doses higher than recommended for human pharmacotherapies. Human CBD studies for epilepsy and psychiatric disorders reported CBD-induced drug-drug interactions, hepatic abnormalities, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and somnolence. CBD has proven therapeutic efficacy for serious conditions such as Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and is likely to be recommended off label by physicians for other conditions. However, AEs and potential drug-drug interactions must be taken into consideration by clinicians prior to recommending off-label CBD.

"	"Mutations in SLC6A1 have been associated mainly with myoclonic atonic epilepsy (MAE) and intellectual disability. We identified a novel missense mutation in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) characterized by severe seizures and developmental delay. Exome Sequencing was performed in an epilepsy patient cohort. The impact of the mutation was evaluated by 3H γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake, structural modeling, live cell microscopy, cell surface biotinylation and a high-throughput assay flow cytometry in both neurons and non neuronal cells. We discovered a heterozygous missense mutation (c700G to A [pG234S) in the SLC6A1 encoding GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). Structural modeling suggests the mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation. With transient expression of enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) tagged rat GAT-1 cDNAs, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) transporter had reduced total protein expression in both rat cortical neurons and HEK 293 T cells. With a high-throughput flow cytometry assay and live cell surface biotinylation, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) had reduced cell surface expression. 3H radioactive labeling GABA uptake assay in HeLa cells indicated a reduced function of the mutant GAT-1(G234S). This mutation caused instability of the mutant transporter protein, which resulted in reduced cell surface and total protein levels. The mutation also caused reduced GABA uptake in addition to reduced protein expression, leading to reduced GABA clearance, and altered GABAergic signaling in the brain. The impaired trafficking and reduced GABA uptake function may explain the epilepsy phenotype in the patient.

"	"Compound heterozygotes occur when different variants at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of variants at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 Genomes Project participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or infantile spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 Genomes Project data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 Genomes Project participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous variants in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development - PRTG (p = 0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p = 0.022, 1% MAF, combined ancestries) and MACF1 (p = 0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due to the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous variants should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.

"	"To identify brain regions underlying interictal generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA), and their causal interactions, in children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Concurrent scalp EEG-fMRI was performed in 2 separately analyzed patient groups with LGS: 10 children (mean age 8.9 years) scanned under isoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia and 15 older patients (mean age 31.7 years) scanned without anesthesia. Whole-brain event-related analysis determined GPFA-related activation in each group. Results were used as priors in a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis comparing evidence for different neuronal hypotheses describing initiation and propagation of GPFA between cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. A total of 1,045 GPFA events were analyzed (cumulative duration 1,433 seconds). In both pediatric and older groups, activation occurred in distributed association cortical areas, as well as the thalamus and brainstem (p < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error). Activation was similar across individual patients with structural, genetic, and unknown etiologies of epilepsy, particularly in frontoparietal cortex. In both groups, DCM revealed that GPFA was most likely driven by prefrontal cortex, with propagation occurring first to the brainstem and then from brainstem to thalamus. We show reproducible evidence of a cortically driven process within the epileptic network of LGS. This network is present early (in children) and late (in older patients) in the course of the syndrome and across diverse etiologies of epilepsy, suggesting that LGS reflects shared ""secondary network"" involvement. A cortical-to-subcortical hierarchy is postulated whereby GPFA rapidly propagates from prefrontal cortex to the brainstem via extrapyramidal corticoreticular pathways, whereas the thalamus is engaged secondarily.

"	"Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are characterized by normal background EEG activity and generalized interictal spike-and-wave discharges in the absence of any evidence of brain lesion. Absence epilepsies are the prototypes of IGEs. In childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies, by definition, all patients manifest absence seizures associated with an EEG pattern of generalized spike-wave (GSW) discharges. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, myoclonic jerks, usually affecting shoulders and arms bilaterally and appearing upon awakening, are the most characteristic clinical feature. Myoclonic jerks are accompanied on the EEG by generalized spike/polyspike-and-wave (GSW, GPWS) complexes at 3.5-6Hz. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only is a broad and nonspecific category including all patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and an interictal EEG pattern of GSW discharges. Despite the strong heritability and the recent advances in genetic technology, the genetic basis of IGEs remains largely elusive and only in a small minority of patients with classic IGE phenotypes is a monogenic cause identified. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), early infantile encephalopathy with suppression bursts, West syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, once classified among the generalized epilepsies, are now considered to be epileptic encephalopathies. Among them, only Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is characterized by prominent generalized clinical and EEG features.

"	"Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-euphorigenic compound derived from Cannabis, shows promise for improving recovery following cerebral ischemia and has recently been shown effective for the treatment of childhood seizures caused by Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Given evidence for activity to mitigate effects of CNS insult and dysfunction, we considered the possibility that CBD may also protect and improve functional recovery of a complex learned behavior. To test this hypothesis, we have applied a songbird, the adult male zebra finch, as a novel pre-clinical animal model. Their learned vocalizations were temporarily disrupted with bilateral microlesions of HVC (used as a proper name) a pre-vocal motor cortical-like brain region that drives song. These microlesions destroy about 10% of HVC, and temporarily impair song production, syntax and phonology for about seven days. Recovery requires sensorimotor learning as it depends upon auditory feedback. Four CBD doses (0, 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg) within three surgery conditions (microlesion, no-microlesion, sham-microlesion) were evaluated (n = 5-6). Birds were recorded over 20 days: three baseline; six pre-microlesion drug treatment days and; 11 post-microlesion treatment and recovery days. Results indicate 10 and 100 mg/kg CBD effectively reduced the time required to recover vocal phonology and syntax. In the case of phonology, the magnitude of microlesion-related disruptions were also reduced. These results suggest CBD holds promise to improve functional recovery of complex learned behaviors following brain injury, and represent establishment of an important new animal model to screen drugs for efficacy to improve vocal recovery.

Here we used a very high-throughput flow cytometry assay to evaluate the impact of multiple human mutations in GABRB3 on receptor trafficking. In this study we found that surface expression of mutant β3 subunits is variable. However, it was consistent that surface expression of partnering γ2 subunits was lower when co-expressed with mutant than with wild-type subunits. Because γ2 subunits are critical for synaptic GABAA receptor clustering, this provides an important clue for understanding the pathophysiology of GABRB3 mutations. To validate our findings further, we obtained an in-depth comparison of two novel mutations [GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K)] associated with epilepsy with different severities of epilepsy phenotype. GABRB3 (N328D) is associated with the relatively severe Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GABRB3 (E357K) is associated with the relatively mild juvenile absence epilepsy syndrome. With functional characterizations in both heterologous cells and rodent cortical neurons by patch-clamp recordings, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting, we found that both the GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K) mutations reduced total subunit expression in neurons but not in HEK293T cells. Both mutant subunits, however, were reduced on the cell surface and in synapses, but the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome mutant β3 (N328D) subunit was more reduced than the juvenile absence epilepsy mutant β3 (E357K) subunit. Interestingly, both mutant β3 subunits impaired postsynaptic clustering of wild-type GABAA receptor γ2 subunits and prevented γ2 subunits from incorporating into GABAA receptors at synapses, although by different cellular mechanisms. Importantly, wild-type γ2 subunits were reduced and less clustered at inhibitory synapses in Gabrb3+/- knockout mice. This suggests that impaired receptor localization to synapses is a common pathophysiological mechanism for GABRB3 mutations, although the extent of impairment may be different among mutant subunits. The study thus identifies the novel mechanism of impaired targeting of receptors containing mutant β3 subunits and provides critical insights into understanding how GABRB3 mutations produce severe epilepsy syndromes and epilepsy phenotypic heterogeneity.

31468518	"Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function de novo CACNA1A mutations cause severe developmental epileptic encephalopathies in the spectrum of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are genetically heterogeneous severe childhood-onset epilepsies with developmental delay or cognitive deficits. In this study, we explored the pathogenic mechanisms of DEE-associated de novo mutations in the CACNA1A gene. We studied the functional impact of four de novo DEE-associated CACNA1A mutations, including the previously described p.A713T variant and three novel variants (p.V1396M, p.G230V, and p.I1357S). Mutant cDNAs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted to test the impacts on CaV 2.1 channel function. Channel localization and structure were assessed with immunofluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) modeling. We find that the G230V and I1357S mutations result in loss-of-function effects with reduced whole-cell current densities and decreased channel expression at the cell membrane. By contrast, the A713T and V1396M variants resulted in gain-of-function effects with increased whole-cell currents and facilitated current activation (hyperpolarized shift). The A713T variant also resulted in slower current decay. 3D modeling predicts conformational changes favoring channel opening for A713T and V1396M. Our findings suggest that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function CACNA1A mutations are associated with similarly severe DEEs and that functional validation is required to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and to guide therapies.

"	"The goal of this study was to characterize the drug-drug interactions between clobazam and 2 antiseizure drugs, cannabidiol and stiripentol, for treatment of refractory seizures through the use of pharmacokinetic modeling. A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to characterize the combined effect of clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (i.e., N-clobazam), on seizure protection in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using data from the phase 3 CONTAIN trial. Drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cannabidiol were examined by comparing model-generated data to data from a study of 13 patients taking concomitant clobazam and cannabidiol. Modeling data were also descriptively compared with studies of patients administered both clobazam and stiripentol. Sedation-related adverse events from CONTAIN were analyzed to determine the exposure-somnolence relationship of clobazam. Exposure-efficacy analysis from the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model using CONTAIN data indicated that clobazam (half-maximal effective concentration [EC50], 303 ng/mL) was 3 times more potent than N-clobazam (EC50, 899 ng/mL). After administration of clobazam, when both clobazam and N-clobazam concentrations were each 1 to 2 times the EC50 value (clobazam dose, 20 mg), 70.0%-74.9% seizure protection was predicted; when concentrations were >2 times the EC50 value (clobazam dose, 40 mg), 74.0%-96.9% seizure protection was predicted. Generalized additive model analyses demonstrated decreased seizure probability with higher plasma concentration of clobazam. Coadministration of stiripentol and clobazam resulted in increased respective median plasma concentrations of clobazam and N-clobazam (1.1-1.2 times and 5.2-8.2 times) compared with administration of placebo and clobazam. Probability of somnolence significantly increased with age and higher N-clobazam plasma concentration. Awareness of drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cannabidiol is needed when adding cannabidiol or stiripentol to a regimen of clobazam or vice versa. Based upon our population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, we predict that an increase in N-clobazam levels, which patient data show may enhance efficacy and/or make adverse events such as somnolence more likely.

"	"To describe the use of a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model incorporating weight and ontogeny to identify effective clobazam (CLB) dosing for use in a clinical trial in pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome. Pharmacokinetic data were combined from 3 CLB trials (OV-1012, OV-1017, and study 301) and a simulated study (study 401) for a total of 1306 CLB and 1305 N-desmethyl clobazam (N-CLB) samples from 193 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients and healthy subjects aged 6 months to 45 years. A structured approach based on US Food and Drug Administration guidance and pharmacometric knowledge discovery was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effects approach. Graphing and fitting using logistical weight regression were used to identify covariates for inclusion in the final model, which was evaluated using goodness-of-fit criteria and validated using prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC). Using the final PopPK model, a simulation study determined CLB and N-CLB distributions after 4 weeks of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg CLB. The parameters of the final PopPK model were similar to previous reports. Fixed-effect parameters were precisely estimated, with no significant increase in NONMEM objective function value. Intersubject variability estimates were similar to previous reports, with <35% shrinkage associated with parameter variability, except for intercompartmental clearance and apparent volumes of distribution of peripheral compartments. Goodness-of-fit plots and pcVPC show that the model adequately described CLB and N-CLB data. The CLB/N-CLB ratio in virtual study subjects aged <3 years was 0.23 for 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg and was 0.14 for subjects aged ≥3 years, which is 2 to 3 times those reported in a previous stiripentol/CLB/valproate study in which seizure improvement was reported. The PopPK model dosing parameters of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg are likely to result in efficacious concentrations of CLB and N-CLB in pediatric patients as young as 16 months. Dosages exceeding 1.5 mg/kg should be monitored for tolerability, particularly in patients aged <2 years, as there may be a higher incidence of sedation.

"	"To assess long-term efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in children with epilepsy and a broad spectrum of underlying epileptic etiologies. Patients with epilepsy treated with rufinamide between 1/1/2009 and 1/1/2018 at Seattle Children's Hospital were included. Data were collected via retrospective chart review. Rufinamide efficacy was defined as seizure reduction from baseline including seizure free, >50% reduction, any reduction, no reduction, or worsening seizures. Pearson's chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. 183 patients (70 females and 113 males) with a broad spectrum of epileptic aetiologies (genetic/metabolic, hypoxic-ischemic, structural and others) were included. 45.9% of the patients had Lennox Gastaut syndrome. Rate of any seizure reduction was at 47.5%, seizure reduction >50% at 35%, and seizure free at 3.3%. Mean rufinamide dosage was 33.9 mg/kg/d (SD = 14.12). Mean duration of treatment was 44.48 months (SD 32.33). Suspected adverse effects occurred at 10.9%, most often as fatigue. Rufinamide achieved better seizure reduction in girls compared to boys [OR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.28, 0.97), p = 0.038]. Seizures were activated in a patient with a SCN1A mutation, fully controlled in a patient with a SCN8A mutation. Patients with certain genetic abnormalities such as DEPDC5, KCNQ2, SPATA5, and 47XYY achieved significant seizure reduction. Rufinamide is an effective and well-tolerated drug for long-term treatment in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. Certain genotypes such as SCN8A showed good response to rufinamide. Girls seemed to respond better than boys.

31625159	"Coadministered cannabidiol and clobazam: Preclinical evidence for both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions.
"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat intractable childhood epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, the intrinsic anticonvulsant activity of CBD has been questioned due to a pharmacokinetic interaction between CBD and a first-line medication, clobazam. This recognized interaction has led to speculation that the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD may simply reflect CBD augmenting clobazam exposure. The present study aimed to address the nature of the interaction between CBD and clobazam. We examined whether CBD inhibits human CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), respectively, and performed studies assessing the effects of CBD on brain and plasma pharmacokinetics of clobazam in mice. We then used the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome to examine how CBD and clobazam interact. We compared anticonvulsant effects of CBD-clobazam combination therapy to monotherapy against thermally-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and mortality in Scn1a+/- mice. In addition, we used Xenopus oocytes expressing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors to investigate the activity of GABAA receptors when treated with CBD and clobazam together. CBD potently inhibited CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of clobazam and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism of N-CLB. Combination CBD-clobazam treatment resulted in greater anticonvulsant efficacy in Scn1a+/- mice, but only when an anticonvulsant dose of CBD was used. It is important to note that a sub-anticonvulsant dose of CBD did not promote greater anticonvulsant effects despite increasing plasma clobazam concentrations. In addition, we delineated a novel pharmacodynamic mechanism where CBD and clobazam together enhanced inhibitory GABAA receptor activation. Our study highlights the involvement of both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between CBD and clobazam that may contribute to its efficacy in Dravet syndrome.

"	"ARFGEF1 encodes a guanine exchange factor involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, and is a candidate gene for childhood genetic epilepsies. To model ARFGEF1 haploinsufficiency observed in a recent Lennox Gastaut Syndrome patient, we studied a frameshift mutation (Arfgef1fs) in mice. Arfgef1fs/+ pups exhibit signs of developmental delay, and Arfgef1fs/+ adults have a significantly decreased threshold to induced seizures but do not experience spontaneous seizures. Histologically, the Arfgef1fs/+ brain exhibits a disruption in the apical lining of the dentate gyrus and altered spine morphology of deep layer neurons. In primary hippocampal neuron culture, dendritic surface and synaptic but not total GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are reduced in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons with an accompanying decrease in the number of GABAAR-containing recycling endosomes in cell body. Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in the number of GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body. Together, the altered endosome composition and decreased neuronal surface GABAAR results suggests a mechanism whereby impaired neuronal inhibition leads to seizure susceptibility.

"	"It is estimated that about 70 million people all over the world suffer from epilepsy, half of which are children, in whom the prevalence is around 0.5 to 0.8%. Although there are several therapies, the treatment of epilepsy is based mainly on drugs, which, depending on the year of coming onto the market are classified as first, second, or third generation. In this article, a description is presented on the main characteristics of the latest generation of anti-epileptic drugs (lacosamide, eslicarbazepine acetate, brivaracetam, perampanel, retigabine, everolimus and cannabidiol). These, with the exception of retigabine (is not yet on the market), are considered safe and effective in the paediatric population. Everolimus and cannabidiol have very specific indications (tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome, and Lennox Gastaut syndrome), while the rest are indicated in the management of seizures of focal origin in children from 4 years-old. These new molecules have been developed in order to provide a pharmaceutical profile and tolerance superior to the previously available drugs, and it is forecast that as their use increases, their true potential and profile will widen. Furthermore, for the first time in Paediatric Epileptology, the extrapolation of the efficacy data in adults have been used (together with specific safety and pharmacokinetic studies in the paediatric population), in order to speed up their approval for use in the child population.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) denotes a refractory epileptic encephalopathy of childhood onset with the triad of generalized slow spike-wave (GSSW) on interictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), multiple seizure types, and intellectual impairment. The neurobiology of LGS is said to sustain abnormal patterns of brain activity and connectivity that ultimately impair normal cerebral developmental mechanisms. However, we describe eight patients from our combined practice who presented with electroclinical findings consistent with LGS but without significant cognitive impairment. All patients fulfilled the other criteria of LGS with multiple seizure types (three or more of generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, myoclonic, and atypical absence) and GSSW activity on EEG. Four subjects completed high school, two completed some college, two acquired college degrees, and all performed basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) independently. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in all patients. We speculate that a variation of the classic phenotype of LGS can present with preserved cognitive and functional status, often with onset in the second decade of life, and associated with normal brain imaging.

"	"Aim:  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of childhood-onset epilepsy with multiple types of seizures, specific discharges on electroencephalography, and intellectual disability. However, LGS-related genes are largely unknown. To identify causative genes related to LGS, we collected and analyzed data from a three-generation Korean family in which one member had LGS and two had intellectual disability.  Methods:  Genomic DNAs were extracted from blood samples of all participants and used in whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic variants were detected by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was evaluated by prediction programs and the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. The LGS patient had generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges, multiple types of seizures, and developmental delay.  Results:  Analyses of the WES data from the family revealed a novel variant (c.1048G>A, p.Ala350Thr) in the IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2). This variant is within a highly evolutionarily conserved IQ-like motif, indicating a decrease in the calmodulin-binding capacity or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid transmission. The hemizygous variant in the male with LGS was a maternally inherited X-linked variant from the heterozygous maternal grandmother and mother, both of whom had intellectual disability.  Conclusion:  These findings indicate that the variant of IQSEC2 triggered both LGS and intellectual disability dependent on sex in this family. We report a novel X-linked inherited IQSEC2 variant for LGS and intellectual disability, which enhances the spectrum of variants in the IQ-like motif of IQSEC2.

"	"Since the federal ban on hemp products was lifted in December 2018, cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid derived from hemp, has become increasingly popular and accessible. CBD is sold in the form of oils, tablets, and foods in locations including gas stations, cafés, and drug stores. Despite a lack of reliable evidence, many parents praise its purported therapeutic effects on a variety of childhood ailments. Epidiolex was the first CBD-based medication to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, known as Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome, in patients of at least 2 years of age. Its efficacy was assessed through three randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled trials in a sample of 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Despite this development, there are few or no large-scale, rigorous studies concerning the effects of CBD on any other pediatric conditions that parents have tried to alleviate with CBD. The purpose of this review is to explore recent literature regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD in treating various health conditions in children; the risks of consuming CBD products, and the role of pediatricians in helping parents navigate often-confusing information about CBD. Although CBD use has dramatically increased in recent years, both its potential to treat conditions and its risks have not yet been subjected to rigorous study. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks posed by poor-quality standards and labeling practices for cannabinoid products. Due to the confusing nature of the numerous sources of information about CBD, pediatricians are in a position to provide and clarify information about CBD to parents and understand the risks it poses to children.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe subtype of childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy with drug-resistant and poor surgical prognosis. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes with structural brain lesions including focal abnormalities or asymmetric slow-spike-wave (SSW) patterns remain largely unknown. Due to the contradictory lateralization difference between MRI lesions and EEG pattern in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes, it is difficult to determine the precise lateralization of epileptic lesions, which is crucial to better surgical prognosis. This study is aim to ascertain the clinical characteristics of the EEG patterns, and its relationship with MRI lesions and to evaluate its prognostic value of surgical treatment in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Twenty-four symptomatic LGS cases with asymmetric EEG SSW patterns and contralaterally independent or contralaterally dominant MRI lesions were collected, and their clinical features were analyzed retrospectively. In this cohort, most of lesions were perinatal or acquired during the first 6 months of life. The most common etiology was intracerebral hemorrhage. The LGS patients with both asymmetric SSW and focal sporadic epileptic waves (SEW) patterns showed the best surgical outcome with Engel class I level. Asymmetric SSW patterns with maximal discharges contralateral to MRI lesions were frequently observed in most of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Predominantly diffuse destructive lesions led to an attenuated voltage of ipsilateral scalp EEG producing an asymmetric SSW pattern in those patients with symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Our study reveals a special SEW EEG pattern in symptomatic LG patients with asymmetric SSW and MRI lesions contralateral to the dominant EEG patterns. Contradictory lateralization difference between MRI and EEG probably arises from the relative voltage attenuation presenting in EEG ipsilateral to huge destructive lesions from early life. Our study suggests that the independent focal SEW activity remaining ipsilateral to the MRI lesion can potentially predict better surgical prognosis in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes.

"	"Heterozygous mutations in the STXBP1 gene encoding the presynaptic protein MUNC18-1 cause STXBP1 encephalopathy, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Impaired mutant protein stability leading to reduced synaptic transmission is considered the main underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Here, we report the first two cases carrying a homozygous STXBP1 mutation, where their heterozygous siblings and mother are asymptomatic. Both cases were diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In Munc18-1 null mouse neurons, protein stability of the disease variant (L446F) is less dramatically affected than previously observed for heterozygous disease mutants. Neurons expressing Munc18L446F showed minor changes in morphology and synapse density. However, patch clamp recordings demonstrated that L446F causes a 2-fold increase in evoked synaptic transmission. Conversely, paired pulse plasticity was reduced and recovery after stimulus trains also. Spontaneous release frequency and amplitude, the readily releasable vesicle pool and the kinetics of short-term plasticity were all normal. Hence, the homozygous L446F mutation causes a gain-of-function phenotype regarding release probability and synaptic transmission while having less impact on protein levels than previously reported (heterozygous) mutations. These data show that STXBP1 mutations produce divergent cellular effects, resulting in different clinical features, while sharing the overarching encephalopathic phenotype (developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy).

About 2/3 of patients were responders, including 35.2 % that had a ≥75 % decrease in their seizures. Among these 16.9 % had a ≥90 % decrease. No improvement was seen in 14 patients; 5 had a less than 50 % response, and 6 had seizure aggravation. Therefore, 25 (35.2 %) were considered non-responders.

Cannabinoid treatments for pain and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (Nabiximols) have been approved in several countries. Cannabidiol (CBD), in contrast to tetra-hydro-cannabidiol (THC), is not a controlled substance in the European Union, and over the years there has been increasing use of CBD-enriched extracts and pure CBD for seizure disorders, particularly in children. No analytical controls are mandatory for CBD-based products and a pronounced variability in CBD concentrations in commercialized CBD oil preparations has been identified. Randomized controlled trials of plant-derived CBD for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) have provided evidence of anti-seizure effects, and in June 2018, CBD was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an add-on antiepileptic drug for patients two years of age and older with LGS or DS. Medical cannabis, with various ratios of CBD and THC and in different galenic preparations, is licensed in many European countries for several indications, and in July 2019, the European Medicines Agency also granted marketing authorisation for CBD in association with clobazam, for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS.

According to the pattern of background activity, we divided our cohort into two groups: Group 1: normal background activity or with localized intermittent slow waves; Group 2: intermittent slow waves appearing generalized or in two or more lobes. Subjects included 22 children (Group 1: n=10; Group 2: n=12) diagnosed with ESwoH who received treatment from 2007 to 2017. The median age at onset of epileptic spasms was 5.5 months and the follow-up period lasted for 40.5 months. ACTH therapy was performed for seven patients from Group 1 and eight patients from Group 2. Only one patient from Group 2 responded to ACTH. Patients receiving effective treatments at early stages had excellent seizure outcome. Refractory cases included six patients in Group 1 and eight patients in Group 2; subsequent follow-up EEGs indicated hypsarrhythmia in one patient in Group 1 (17%) and six patients (75%) in Group 2, including one patient whose EEG pattern indicated progression to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, ACTH is ineffective for patients with epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia. The EEG may indicate possible future development of hypsarrhythmia if epileptic spasms are resistant to treatment, especially in patients with diffuse slow waves on pre-treatment EEG. The efficacy of treatment introduced at early stages from onset may predict long-term seizure outcome.

After 1-year follow up, we observed seizure freedom in two patients, 75% seizure reduction in two patients, 50% reduction in three patients, and 25% reduction in one patient. After 2-year follow up, the outcomes were seizure freedom in two patients, 90% seizure reduction in one patient, 75% reduction in two patients, and 50% reduction in two patients. EEG findings improved in nine patients. Nine patients were treated with DTs for 1 year; all patients demonstrated improved cognitive status. Eight patients were treated with DTs for 2 years, of whom seven had improved cognitive status. Poor tolerability of DTs was due to poor oral intake and gastrointestinal problems. We demonstrate that, in LGS with mitochondrial dysfunction, improvement of seizures and cognitive function are not inferior to those in other patients treated with DTs. This study showed that DTs are efficacious and feasible for LGS patients with mitochondrial dysfunction and can significantly improve their prognosis.

32096470	"Epilepsy and cannabidiol: a guide to treatment
"	"The growing interest in cannabidiol (CBD), specifically a pure form of CBD, as a treatment for epilepsy, among other conditions, is reflected in recent changes in legislation in some countries. Although there has been much speculation about the therapeutic value of cannabis-based products as an anti-seizure treatment for some time, it is only within the last two years that Class I evidence has been available for a pure form of CBD, based on placebo-controlled RCTs for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. However, just as we are beginning to understand the significance of CBD as a treatment for epilepsy, in recent years, a broad spectrum of products advertised to contain CBD has emerged on the market. The effects of these products are fundamentally dependent on the purity, preparation, and concentration of CBD and other components, and consensus and standardisation are severely lacking regarding their preparation, composition, usage and effectiveness. This review aims to provide information to neurologists and epileptologists on the therapeutic value of CBD products, principally a purified form, in routine practice for patients with intractable epilepsy.

32207730	"Why the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare one?
"	"The review addresses the problem of the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Despite the presence of a vivid clinical and encephalographic picture, classical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which meets all of its diagnostic criteria, is quite rare. Many authors believe that the diagnosis of the syndrome is possible if the patient has tonic seizures and typical ictal and interictal patterns on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The diagnosis of the syndrome is considered probable if there are typical EEG patterns of wakefulness and sleep, but no tonic seizures are recorded. Diagnosis of the syndrome is complicated by its polyetiology (clinical and EEG manifestations can vary significantly), the evolution of seizure types and EEG characteristics as the patient matures, the presence of other epileptic syndromes similar to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Here, we present a multicenter series of patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) and related electroclinical patterns (REP) other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who were treated with rufinamide as add-on therapy. Medical records of 34 patients with DEE and REP other than LGS treated with add-on rufinamide seen at four pediatric neurology centers in Argentina between May 2014 and March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated 34 patients (18 males, 16 females), aged between 2 and 15 years with a mean and median age of 6 and 8 years, respectively. The children had different types of childhood-onset refractory DEE and REP other than LGS and were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 20 months (range, 12-60 months). Twenty-two of 34 patients (64.5%) who received rufinamide as add-on therapy had a greater than 50% decrease in seizures, and two patients (5.8%) became seizure-free. Four patients (11.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in four others (11.7%) and increased in two patients (5.8%). The final mean dosage of rufinamide was 31.5 ± 15.5 mg/kg per day (range, 19-75.4 mg/kg) if combined with valproic acid and of 35.4 ± 11.5 mg/kg per day (range, 8-60.5 mg/kg) without valproic acid. Adverse effects were recorded in nine patients (26.4%). A seizure increase was reported in two of 24 patients (7.3%). Rufinamide may be used as a treatment option in DEE and REP other than LGS.

32350749	"A Phase II Randomized Trial to Explore the Potential for Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions with Stiripentol or Valproate when Combined with Cannabidiol in Patients with Epilepsy
"	"In recent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, highly purified cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It is anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered concomitantly with cannabidiol. This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy, and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol. This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex® in the USA; Epidyolex® in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound. The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02607891.

32401350	"Stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative treatment for drug-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Laser interstitial thermal therapy has been increasingly used in the treatment of epilepsy. Here, we assess the safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy (SLACC) for drop attacks in LGS. We reviewed sequential cases of patients with medically intractable LGS who underwent SLACC using a two-cannula technique between November 2014 and July 2019. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the anteroposterior length of callosal ablation (contrast-enhancing lesion) and estimated disconnection (gap in tract projections on diffusion tensor imaging). Patients were followed longitudinally to assess clinical outcomes. Ten patients were included in this study. The median age was 33 (range = 11-52) years, median duration of epilepsy was 26 (range = 10-49) years, and median duration of postoperative follow-up was 19 (range = 6-40) months. In the anteroposterior direction, 53 ± 7% (mean ± SD) of the corpus callosum was ablated and 62 ± 19% of the corpus callosum was estimated to be disconnected. Six (60%) of 10 patients achieved >80% seizure reduction, two (20%) of whom became seizure-free. Eight (80%) patients had >80% reduction in drop attacks, five (50%) of whom became free of drop attacks. Three patients subsequently underwent laser posterior callosotomy with further improvement in drop attacks and/or overall seizure frequency. One patient had an asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage along the cannula tract. One patient developed significant aggression after becoming seizure-free. Seizure outcomes following SLACC were comparable to previously reported outcomes of open callosotomy, with reasonable safety profile. SLACC appears to be an effective alternative to open anterior corpus callosotomy with minimal postoperative discomfort and a short recovery period.

"	"Tongue bites frequently occur during seizures in epilepsy patients. We report two cases of cognitively impaired Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients with reactive lesions on the tongues. Case 1 was a 30-year-old man whose chief complaint was mouth pain. Local finding was a small bean-sized pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 45-year-old man whose chief complaint was bleeding from the mouth. His clinical finding was blood loss anemia. Local finding was a 20-mm-diameter pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as pyogenic granuloma. These mass lesions were believed to be reactive, caused by repetitive minor damage involving reparative fibrous tissue response. Therefore, the two cases may have involved reparative responses to mucosal injury incurred by accidental bites during epileptic seizures. Intellectual disability made medical treatment difficult and had allowed the massive lesions to form. It is necessary for cognitively impaired epilepsy patients to undergo regular dental examinations in order to get used to dental checks and to increase the number of intraoral observations in the context of close cooperation between dentists and epilepsy therapists.

"	"To evaluate the potential impact of concomitant clobazam (CLB) use on the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using meta-analytical techniques. We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion of patients who achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Four trials were included and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). CBD was associated with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.

32467926	"GABAA  receptor β3 subunit mutation D120N causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in knock-in mice
"	"The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a devastating early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, associated with severe behavioural abnormalities. Its pathophysiology, however, is largely unknown. A de novo mutation (c.G358A, p.D120N) in the human GABA type-A receptor β3 subunit gene (GABRB3) has been identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. To determine whether the mutation causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in vivo in mice and to elucidate its mechanistic effects, we generated the heterozygous Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse and found that it had frequent spontaneous atypical absence seizures, as well as less frequent tonic, myoclonic, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these seizure types had a unique and characteristic ictal EEG. In addition, knock-in mice displayed abnormal behaviours seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome including impaired learning and memory, hyperactivity, impaired social interactions and increased anxiety. This Gabrb3 mutation did not alter GABA type-A receptor trafficking or expression in knock-in mice. However, cortical neurons in thalamocortical slices from knock-in mice had reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitude and prolonged spontaneous thalamocortical oscillations. Thus, the Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse recapitulated human Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizure types and behavioural abnormalities and was caused by impaired inhibitory GABAergic signalling in the thalamocortical loop. In addition, treatment with antiepileptic drugs and cannabinoids ameliorated atypical absence seizures in knock-in mice. This congenic knock-in mouse demonstrates that a single-point mutation in a single gene can cause development of multiple types of seizures and multiple behavioural abnormalities. The knock-in mouse will be useful for further investigation of the mechanisms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome development and for the development of new antiepileptic drugs and treatments.

"	"The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy using the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record (EHR) data. We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean ± standard deviation: 6.5 ± 3.2 years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.

"	"Epilepsy is the noncommunicable and chronic central nervous system disorder characterized by frequent, unprovoked seizures, or electrical disturbances in the brain. Topiramate is used as an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of partial onset seizures, generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Topiramate, a BCS class II drug, has a relatively low bioavailability. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein and Blood Brain Barrier restricts its entry into the brain. This investigation was aimed to prepare O/W nanoemulsion delivery system of topiramate to improve its brain bioavailability. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was prepared by phase titration method. It was consisting of 2% w/w Capmul MCM C8, 32% w/w Tween 20:Carbitol (2:1) and 66% w/w water. It was characterized for globule size, viscosity, polydispersibility index, zeta potential, pH, conductivity values, transmittance and TEM. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and brain drug uptake study was carried out using wistar albino rats post intranasal and oral administration. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was having a globule size of 4.73 ± 0.52 nm. It was stable for six months. Brain uptake of topiramate post intranasal administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was significantly (P < 1.86 × 10-8) higher when it was compared with oral administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion. This study indicates that intranasal administration of topiramate containing nanoemulsion could be an encouraging approach for the treatment of epilepsy to minimize the dose of topiramate in direction to avoid dose related adverse events.

"	"The efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) with and without concomitant clobazam (CLB) was evaluated in stratified analyses of four large randomized controlled trials, two in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and two in Dravet syndrome. Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex® in the US; Epidyolex® in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.

Among our patients who were prescribed the new cannabidiol formulation, we observed several cases of thrombocytopenia and therefore embarked on this study. We conducted a single-center systematic chart review of all pediatric patients (<21 years old) who were prescribed cannabidiol from January to August 2019. We evaluated salient features of the patients' epilepsy syndrome, age, concurrent medications, and surveillance laboratory results before and after cannabidiol initiation. Among 87 patients, nine (10%) developed thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir range = 17 000-108 000) following initiation of cannabidiol. Each of these nine children was on combination therapy of cannabidiol with valproic acid. Whereas no children on cannabidiol without valproic acid (0/57) developed thrombocytopenia, nine of 23 treated with combination valproic acid and cannabidiol developed platelets < 110 000/µL (P < .0001). We report a novel and clinically important side effect of thrombocytopenia in one-third of patients treated concurrently with cannabidiol and valproic acid.

"	"Head motion is a significant barrier to functional MRI (fMRI) in patients who are unable to tolerate awake scanning, including young children or those with cognitive and behavioural impairments. General anaesthesia minimises motion and ensures patient comfort, however the optimal anaesthesia regimen for fMRI in the paediatric setting is unknown. In this study, we tested the feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in 11 patients (mean age = 9.8 years) with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with intellectual disability. fMRI was acquired during clinically-indicated MRI sessions using a synergistic anaesthesia regimen we typically administer for epilepsy neurosurgery: combined low-dose isoflurane (≤ 0.8% end-tidal concentration) with remifentanil (≤ 0.1 mcg/kg/min). Using group-level independent component analysis, we assessed the presence of resting-state networks by spatially comparing results in the anaesthetised patients to resting-state network templates from the 'Generation R' study of 536 similarly-aged non-anaesthetised healthy children (Muetzel et al. in Hum Brain Mapp 37(12):4286-4300, 2016). Numerous resting-state networks commonly studied in non-anaesthetised healthy children were readily identifiable in the anaesthetised patients, including the default-mode, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal networks. Independent component time-courses associated with these networks showed spectral characteristics suggestive of a neuronal origin of fMRI signal fluctuations, including high dynamic range and temporal frequency power predominantly below 0.1 Hz. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in children, suggesting that combined isoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia may be an effective strategy to extend the emerging clinical applications of resting-state fMRI (for example, neurosurgical planning) to the variety of patient groups who may otherwise be impractical to scan.

"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a novel therapy for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a rare, treatment-refractory epileptic encephalopathy. Two pivotal trials found CBD 20 mg/kg/day conferred a reduction from baseline in median drop seizure frequency of 44% and 42%, respectively, compared with 22% and 17%, respectively, in the usual care arms. No economic evaluations have been published to date. This analysis assessed the cost effectiveness of CBD adjunct therapy compared with usual care alone in LGS from the US payer perspective. We developed a lifetime horizon Markov decision analytic model. Efficacy, healthcare costs (2020 US$), and health state utilities were ascertained from published clinical trials, retrospective analyses, and time trade-off interviews conducted in the UK, respectively. Fifteen-year-old patients entering the model transitioned to states representing a percentage reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline, where they remained until reverting back to baseline drop seizure frequency, or death. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter uncertainty, and scenario analyses investigated the impact of various assumptions. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Compared with usual care alone, CBD yielded 0.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $314,900 additional healthcare expenditure, resulting in $451,800 per QALY. Uncertainty in health state utilities were the largest contributor to uncertainty in the results. Results from the 5000-simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance of CBD being cost effective at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, with a 95% credible range for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $325,300-$690,000 per QALY. CBD does not appear to be a cost-effective therapeutic option in LGS patients at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.

The electrophysiological properties of each mutant channel were investigated by voltage-clamp and current-clamp analyses of HEK293T cells overexpressing these channels. Two patients diagnosed with Rett syndrome and West syndrome were found to have known pathological CACNA1G mutations reported in cerebellar ataxia cohorts: c.2881G > A, p.Ala961Thr and c.4591A > G, p.Met1531Val, respectively. One patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was revealed to harbor a previously unreported heterozygous variant: c.3817A > T, p.Ile1273Phe. Clinical symptoms of the two patients with known mutations included severe developmental delay without acquisition of the ability to walk independently. The patient with a potentially novel mutation showed developmental delay, intractable seizures, and mild cerebral atrophy on MRI, but the severity of symptoms was milder than in the former two cases. Electrophysiological study using HEK293T cells demonstrated significant changes of T-type Ca2+ currents by p.Ala961Thr and p.Met1531Val SNVs, which were likely to enhance oscillation of membrane potential at low frequencies. In contrast, p.Ile1273Phe showed no significant effects in our electrophysiological evaluations, with its pathogenesis remaining undetermined. De novo variants of CACNA1G explain some neurodevelopmental disorders. Our study further provides information to understand the genotype-phenotype correlations of patients with CACNA1G mutations.

Impairments entailing absence or near absence of independent function (profound impairment) were observed in 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 domains for 58 (25%), 78 (34%), 40 (17%), 33 (14%), and 22 (10%) children, respectively. After adjustment for age, impairment levels varied substantially across DEE group for mobility (p < 0.0001), feeding (p < 0.0001), communication (p < 0.0001), hand grasp (p < 0.0001), and number of profoundly impaired domains (p < 0.0001). Three or four profoundly affected domains were reported in 44% of KCNQ2-DEE participants, followed by LGS (29%), KCNB1-DEE (27%), ESES (7%), and Dravet syndrome (6%). Many children with DEEs experience severe functional impairments, and few children have typical function. As precision therapies will emphasize nonseizures consequences of DEEs, understanding the nature of abilities and impairments will be critical to selecting appropriate outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

"	"Epidiolex® (Cannabidiol- CBD) is approved for epilepsy associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients over 2 years of age. Common side effects include somnolence and diarrhea. Recent studies have demonstrated interactions between cannabidiol and several other antiseizure medications. However, little is known regarding interactions between cannabidiol and other classes of medications. We discuss an autistic patient with LGS and significant psychiatric comorbidities who was being treated with multiple antiseizure and psychiatric medications, including lithium, when CBD was added to his medical regimen. Several weeks after initiating CBD therapy, he developed hypersomnolence, ataxia and decreased oral intake and was found to have lithium toxicity. Lithium was discontinued and his symptoms resolved. He remains on CBD and 2 other antiseizure medications, seizure-free with improved behavior. We review mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics of CBD and discuss possible explanations for lithium toxicity in this patient.

32854045	"Electroclinical pattern in the transition from West to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"The aim of this study was to analyze electroclinical features of a group of patients with West syndrome (WS) who subsequently developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) during the transition between both syndromes. A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted of a series of patients diagnosed with WS who developed LGS seen at Hospital de Pediatría Prof. Dr. JP Garrahan between January 2012 and January 2019. The medical charts of 170 patients with WS were analyzed. In 63 (37 %) of the children WS evolved to LGS. During the transition from WS to LGS four well-defined electroclinical patterns were recognized. The first corresponded to a group of patients with multiple seizure types, including epileptic spasms associated with multifocal paroxysms; the electroclinical pattern in second group showed mainly focal seizures associated with focal discharges in the EEG; the third group showed predominance of epileptic spasms and myoclonic seizures associated with diffuse spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave paroxysms; and the remaining group was characterized by a mixed electroclinical pattern including features of the other three groups. All patients had a neuropsychological deficit. Worsening of cognition and behavior was observed during the transition period in 11, 8, and 5 patients of groups 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Our study of the transition period from WS to LGS allowed us to recognize four well-defined electroclinical patterns. The early recognition of the different patterns could, in the future, support a more precocious prognostic evaluation.

We present two pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy secondary to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treated with the RNS System. Both patients have experienced 75-99% clinical seizure reductions in >1 year of follow-up. We illustrate that children with diffuse onset, multifocal epilepsy, including frontal and thalamic circuits thought to exist in the generation of LGS seizures, can be treated with responsive neurostimulation safely and effectively, targeting thalamic networks, and avoiding palliative disconnections and resections.

32910945	"Cannabidiol inhibits multiple cardiac ion channels and shortens ventricular action potential duration in vitro
"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis which has recently received regulatory consideration for the treatment of intractable forms of epilepsy such as the Dravet and the Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. The mechanisms of the antiepileptic effects of CBD are unclear, but several pre-clinical studies suggest the involvement of ion channels. Therefore, we have evaluated the effects of CBD on seven major cardiac currents shaping the human ventricular action potential and on Purkinje fibers isolated from rabbit hearts to assess the in vitro cardiac safety profile of CBD. We found that CBD inhibits with comparable micromolar potencies the peak and late components of the NaV1.5 sodium current, the CaV1.2 mediated L-type calcium current, as well as all the repolarizing potassium currents examined except Kir2.1. The most sensitive channels were KV7.1 and the least sensitive were KV11.1 (hERG), which underly the slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) components, respectively, of the cardiac delayed-rectifier current. In the Purkinje fibers, CBD decreased the action potential (AP) duration more potently at half-maximal than at near complete repolarization, and slightly decreased the AP amplitude and its maximal upstroke velocity. CBD had no significant effects on the membrane resting potential except at the highest concentration tested under fast pacing rate. These data show that CBD impacts cardiac electrophysiology and suggest that caution should be exercised when prescribing CBD to carriers of cardiac channelopathies or in conjunction with other drugs known to affect heart rhythm or contractility.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe pediatric epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple drug-resistant seizure types. Children with LGS usually experience cognitive regression, and LGS is almost always associated with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Rufinamide (RFM) was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2007 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients ≥4 years of age. The primary objective of our study was to assess cognitive, adaptive, and behavior functioning of patients with LGS after 12 months of RFM therapy. This was an observational, multicenter, prospective study involving 16 patients diagnosed with LGS aged between 7 and 58 years (mean = 22 ± 16.3). Fourteen of 16 patients were already on therapy with 3 antiseizure drugs and 2/16 with 4 antiseizure drugs; RFM has been added with 100 mg/week increments up to a dose of 300-2400 mg/day. The participants and their parents underwent a neuropsychological evaluation for the assessment of intellectual, adaptive, and emotional/behavioral functioning (Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (LEITER-R), Vineland, and Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL), respectively) before the RFM introduction (baseline) and 12 months after the RFM therapy (T2). Physical and neurological examination, electroencephalography (EEG) recording, seizure type and frequency, and adverse reactions were also considered. After 12 months, the total intelligence quotient (IQ) assessed by LEITER-R did not show statistical significant changes, such as there were no statistically significant changes in adaptive functions, assessed by Vineland. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant changes in internalizing and externalizing problems assessed by CBCL. Adjunctive treatment with RFM did not negatively affect cognitive, adaptive function, and emotional profile in patients with LGS after 1 year of follow-up.

"	"To describe a founder mutation effect and the clinical phenotype of homozygous FRRS1L c.737\_739delGAG (p.Gly246del) variant in 15 children of Puerto Rican (Boricua) ancestry presenting with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE-37) with prominent movement disorder. EIEE-37 is caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the FRRS1L gene, which is critical for AMPA-receptor function, resulting in intractable epilepsy and dyskinesia. A retrospective, multicenter chart review of patients sharing the same homozygous FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant identified by clinical genetic testing. Clinical information was collected regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes, neuroimaging, electrographic features and clinical response to antiseizure medications. Fifteen patients from 12 different families of Puerto Rican ancestry were homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant, with ages ranging from 1 to 25 years. The onset of seizures was from 6 to 24 months. All had hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, and most had hyperkinetic involuntary movements. Developmental regression during the first year of life was common (86%). Electroencephalogram showed hypsarrhythmia in 66% (10/15), with many older children evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Six patients demonstrated progressive volume loss and/or cerebellar atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We describe the largest cohort to date of patients with epileptic encephalopathy. We estimate that 0.76% of unaffected individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry carry this pathogenic variant due to a founder effect. Children homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) Boricua variant exhibit a very homogenous phenotype of early developmental regression and epilepsy, starting with infantile spasms and evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with hyperkinetic movement disorder.

We herewith report on a girl affected by DS, who has been followed from infancy to the current age of 18 years. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic testing for multigene analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders identified two likely de novo pathogenic mutations, a missense variant in GABRB3 gene (c.842 C>T; p.Thr281IIe) and a nonsense variant found in BBS4 gene (c.883 C>T; p.Arg295Ter). A likely relationship between the novel GABRB3 gene variant and the clinical manifestations presented by the girl is proposed. Previously, one case of DS and two of DS-like linked with GABRB3 mutations have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DS associated with this novel variant. A literature review of clinical cases with various types of epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) related to GABRB3 mutations is reported.

"	"To assess the efficacy and safety profile of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) on clobazam and in the overall population of four randomized, controlled phase 3 trials. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD medicine (Epidiolex® in the USA; Epidyolex® in Europe; 100 mg/ml oral solution) at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, or placebo for 14 weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients on clobazam and meta-analysis by syndrome were conducted. The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in primary seizure type during the treatment period. 396 patients with LGS (49% on clobazam) and 318 patients with DS (64% on clobazam) were included. CBD treatment resulted in a reduction in primary seizure frequency vs placebo in the overall population (treatment ratio [95% confidence interval]: LGS, 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; DS, 0.71 [0.60-0.83]) and in patients receiving clobazam (LGS, 0.56 [0.47-0.67]; DS, 0.63 [0.52-0.77]). The antiseizure efficacy of CBD was also demonstrated across other endpoints vs placebo (≥50% responder rate, total seizure frequency, number of seizure-free days, and Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scores) in the overall populations and in patients receiving clobazam. There were higher incidences of somnolence and sedation in patients on CBD and clobazam. Most incidences of elevated transaminases occurred in patients on concomitant valproate and, to a lesser extent, clobazam. Add-on CBD was effective in reducing seizures in the overall populations and in conjunction with clobazam. Somnolence and sedation occurred more frequently in patients on CBD and clobazam.

"	"The observation of mild malformation of cortical development (mMCD) has yet to have a major clinical impact due to the lack of clinical and research data. We characterized the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and postoperative seizure control patterns in pediatric patients with mMCD. We examined 40 patients with isolated mMCD who underwent resective surgery during a 10-year period. The median age at seizure onset was 1.2 years, and the median age at surgery was 7.9 years. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) presented with childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy (21 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 6 West syndrome), and 13 patients (32.5%) presented with intractable focal epilepsy (10 extratemporal lesions, 3 temporal lesions). Twenty-one patients (52.5%) showed ""suspected focal cortical malformation"" on MRI, whereas 16 patients (40.0%) and 3 patients (7.5%) showed normal MRI findings or mild brain atrophy, respectively. The most common surgical procedures were two lobar resections (18 patients, 45.0%), followed by unilobar resections (12 patients, 30.0%) and resections exceeding two lobar boundaries (10 patients, 25.0%). As a final surgical outcome, 24 patients (60.0%) were ILAE Class 1-3. Discontinuation of all AEDs was possible for 36.8% of ILAE Class 1 patients. Regarding the seizure control pattern, fluctuating seizure control was observed most frequently (21 patients, 52.5%). Our results suggest that mMCD is an important pathological finding in children related to a significant degree of epileptogenicity, and resective surgery can have positive outcomes. However, these patients showed unstable postoperative seizure control patterns with a high rate of late recurrence, suggesting difficulties in the surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy.

This review will critically review the pharmacokinetic properties of CBD, the interactions with antiseizure and non-antiseizure medications, and the main tolerability and safety issues to provide guidance for its use in everyday practice. CBD is metabolized in the liver and can influence the activity of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The best characterized drug-drug interaction is between CBD and clobazam. The most common adverse events include somnolence, gastrointestinal discomfort, and increase in serum transaminases. High-grade purified CBD oral solution represents an effective therapeutic option in patients with DS and LGS. The findings cannot be extrapolated to other cannabis-based products, synthetic cannabinoids for medicinal use and non-medicinal cannabis and CBD derivatives.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is among the most severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathies. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS Therapy) in patients with LGS. PubMed database was queried (January 1997 to September 2018) to identify publications reporting on the efficacy of VNS Therapy in patients with LGS, with or without safety findings. Primary endpoint of the meta-analysis was the proportion of responders (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency). Random-effects analysis was used to calculate weighted mean estimates and confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was evaluated by statistical tests including I2 . Of 2752 citations reviewed, 17 articles (480 patients) were eligible including 10 retrospective studies and seven prospective studies. A random-effects model produced a pooled proportion of 54% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 45%, 64%) of patients with LGS who responded to adjunctive VNS Therapy (p for heterogeneity <0.001, I2 =72.9%). Per an exploratory analysis, the calculated incidence of serious adverse events associated with VNS Therapy was 9% (95% CI: 5%, 14%); the rate was higher than in long-term efficacy studies of heterogeneous cohorts with drug-resistant epilepsy and likely attributed to variable definitions of serious adverse events across studies. The meta-analysis of 480 patients with LGS suggests that 54% of patients responded to adjunctive VNS Therapy and that the treatment option was safe and well-tolerated. The response in patients with LGS was comparable to heterogeneous drug-resistant epilepsy populations. A clinical and surgical overview has been included to facilitate the use of VNS in LGS.

"	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder frequently associated with epilepsy and epilepsy is a leading cause of death in ASD patients. Despite growing interest in genetic, neurophysiological and clinical overlaps, data on ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in ASD are lacking since behavioral disorders often make it difficult to obtain EEG recordings. We examined ictal EEG features in a consecutive series of patients with ASD and epilepsy. We retrospectively identified 400 consecutive patients with ASD and epilepsy at our Level 4 Epilepsy center between 2015 and 2019; 45 had at least one EEG-recorded seizure captured. Demographics, age of nonfebrile seizure onset, age of ASD diagnosis, language, magnetic resonance imagining findings, genetic testing and EEG studies were reviewed. Seizures were classified by semiologic and electrographic features. Ictal findings were analyzed. A total of 497 seizures were captured in 45 patients: 20 patients with focal onset epilepsy had 126 seizures (median: 1, range: 1-30), 17 patients with generalized onset epilepsy had 88 seizures (median: 2, range: 1-15), 7 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome had 270 seizures (median: 12, range: 1-74) and one patient had both right hemisphere focal and generalized onsets (12 focal, 1 generalized). Our study is the first to analyze a large set of ictal data in patients with autism spectrum disorder, a population traditionally difficult to obtain ictal recordings. Our results confirm the diverse spectrum of seizure types and provide clinical-EEG correlates of seizures in ASD patients. Both focal-onset and generalized-onset seizures were recorded, confirming that ASD patients have higher rates of both focal and generalized epilepsy syndromes. Among patients with focal epilepsy, temporal and frontal onsets were frequent, suggesting the possibility of epilepsy surgery or brain stimulation. EEG to classify seizures and epilepsies is critical to determine therapeutic options and effort should be made to obtain EEGs in this heterogenous population.

"	"Rufinamide is a triazole derivative that is structurally dissimilar to other marketed antiepileptic drugs, has been assumed a marketing authorization, by the European Union and FDA, for use as a complementary therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This work is concerned with development of two methods for determination of rufinamide (RUF) in presence of 1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4 carboxylic acid as its alkaline degradation product in dosage form. The first method was capable of determing RUF in the presence of its alkaline degradation product and in dosage form. Kromasil C8 column and mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v) were used and UV detection at 210 nm. In the second method, first derivative ratio spectrophotometry, RUF was determined by measuring peak amplitude at 269.5 nm over 5-30 μg/mL. The linearity range of RUF was 10-90 μg/mL for HPLC method covering its therapeutic range with r2 = 0.9999. Forced degradation under alkaline conditions was carried out, the degradation product was isolated and its structure was confirmed. Both methods were validated in accordance to ICH guidelines. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between obtained results and reported ones. The present study is useful for therapeutic drug monitoring and routine analysis of RUF in quality control laboratories. Kinetics of the alkaline degradation of RUF was studied by following the concentration of the remaining drug until complete degradation was achieved.

Due to its unique chemical design and selective binding to the alpha-2 GABA-receptor, CLB has a decreased tendency for sedation compared to other benzodiazepines. A recent literature review shows that sedation, hypersalivation (drooling), and behavior changes are the most common side effects of CLB. It has also been shown that a patient's level of consciousness is indirectly related to the risk of aspiration. Hypersalivation is too is a significant predisposing factor for aspiration. In this report, we present three adult patients with epilepsy who had aspiration pneumonia during treatment with CLB. We would like to raise awareness of increased drooling and somnolence in patients with predisposing factors for aspiration such as treatment with CLB and emphasize vigilance in this regard.

"	"This retrospective study examined patients with probable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) identified from German healthcare data. This 10-year study (2007-2016) assessed healthcare insurance claims information from the Vilua Healthcare research database. A selection algorithm considering diagnoses and drug prescriptions identified patients with probable LGS. To increase the sensitivity of the identification algorithm, two populations were defined: all patients with probable LGS (broadly defined) and only those with a documented epilepsy diagnosis before 6 years of age (narrowly defined). This specific criterion was used as LGS typically has a peak seizure onset between age 3 and 5 years. Primary analyses were prevalence and demographics; secondary analyses included healthcare costs, hospitalization rate and length of stay (LOS), medication use, and mortality. In the final year of the study, 545 patients with broadly defined probable LGS (mean [range] age: 31.4 [2-89] years; male: 53%) were identified. Using the narrowly defined probable LGS definition, the number of patients was reduced to 102 (mean [range] age: 7.4 [2-14] years; male: 52%). Prevalence of broadly defined and narrowly defined probable LGS was 39.2 and 6.5 per 100,000 people. During the 10-year study, 208 patients with narrowly defined probable LGS were identified and followed up for 1379 patient-years. The mean annual cost of healthcare was €22,787 per patient-year (PPY); greatest costs were attributable to inpatient care (33%), home nursing care (13%), and medication (10%). Mean annual healthcare costs were significantly greater for those with prescribed rescue medication (45% of patient-years) versus those without (€33,872 vs. €13,785 PPY, p < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) annual hospitalization rate was 1.6 (2.0) PPY with mean (SD) annual LOS of 22.7 (46.0) days. Annual hospitalization rate was significantly greater in those who were prescribed rescue medication versus those who were not (2.2 [2.3] vs. 1.1 [1.6] PPY, p < 0.001). The mean (SD) number of different medications prescribed was 11.3 (7.3) PPY and 33.8 (17.0) over the entire observable time per patient (OET); antiepileptic drugs only accounted for 2.1 (1.1) of the medications prescribed PPY and 3.8 (2.0) OET. Over the 10-year study period, mortality in patients with narrowly defined probable LGS was significantly higher than the matched control population (six events [2.88%] vs. oneevent [0.01%], p < 0.001). Annual healthcare costs incurred by patients with probable LGS in Germany were substantial, and mostly attributable to inpatient care, home nursing care, and medication. Patients prescribed with rescue medication incurred significantly greater costs than those who were not. Patients with narrowly defined probable LGS had a higher mortality rate versus control populations.

"	"Refractory epilepsy is a chronic brain network disorder characterized by unresponsiveness to multiple (>2) anti-epileptic drugs. Cannabidiol, a non-psychotropic neuroactive substance, is an emerging anti-epileptic treatment that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, especially Lennox Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Here, we evaluated associations between global brain network dynamics and related changes and responsiveness to cannabidiol therapy using a combination of electroencephalography phase coherence and graph theoretical analyses. Refractory epilepsy patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome underwent serial electroencephalography testing prior to and during cannabidiol treatment. Patients showing greater than 70% seizure frequency reduction were classified as treatment responders for the purposes of this study. We calculated inter-electrode electroencephalography phase coherence in delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands. Graph theoretical analysis of brain network dynamics was extracted from phase coherence to evaluate measures of network integration (i.e. characteristic path length, global efficiency and degree) and segregation (i.e. modularity and transitivity). We found that responders, relative to non-responders, showed increased network integration-as indexed by relatively higher global efficiency and lower degree-and increased network segregation-as indexed by relatively higher modularity-exclusively in the beta-frequency band. We also found that larger cannabidiol dosages were associated with increased network integration-as indexed by higher global efficiency with increasing dose-and increased network segregation-as indexed by lower transitivity with increasing dose-in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. In summary, we demonstrate novel effects of cannabidiol on brain network dynamics with important implications for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and, possibly, across broader research applications in the future.

"	"SETBP1 mutations are associated with the Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), characterized by profound neurodevelopmental delay, typical facial features, and multiple congenital malformations (OMIM 269150). Refractory epilepsy is a common feature of SGS. Loss of function mutations have been typically associated with a distinct and milder phenotype characterized by intellectual disability and expressive speech impairment. Here we report three variants of SETBP1, two novel de novo truncating mutations, identified by NGS analysis of an Intellectual Disability gene panel in 600 subjects with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders, and one missense identified by a developmental epilepsy gene panel tested in 56 pediatric epileptic cases. The three individuals carrying the identified SETBP1 variants presented mild to severe developmental delay and lacked the cardinal features of classical SGS. One of these subjects, carrying the c.1765C>T (p.Arg589_) mutation, had mild Intellectual Disability with speech delay; the second one carrying the c.2199\_2203del (p.Glu734Alafs19_) mutation had generalized epilepsy, responsive to treatment, and moderate Intellectual Disability; the third patient showed a severe cognitive defects and had a history of drug resistant epilepsy with West syndrome evolved into a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This latter subject carries the missense c.2572G>A (p.Glu858Lys) variant, which is absent from the control population, reported as de novo in a subject with ASD, and located close to the SETBP1 hot spot for SGS-associated mutations. Our findings contribute to further characterizing the associated phenotypes and suggest inclusion of SETBP1 in the list of prioritized genes for the genetic diagnosis of overlapping phenotypes ranging from non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders to ""developmental and epileptic encephalopathy"" (DEE).

"	"Several small series have described stereotactic MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy for partial callosotomy of astatic and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, especially in association with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Larger case series and comparison of distinct stereotactic methods for stereotactic laser corpus callosotomy (SLCC), however, are currently lacking. The objective of this study was to report seizure outcomes in a series of adult patients with epilepsy following anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures and to compare the results achieved with a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance frames. The authors retrospectively reviewed sequential adult epilepsy surgery patients who underwent SLCC procedures at a single institution. They describe workflows, stereotactic errors, percentage disconnection, hospitalization durations, adverse events, and seizure outcomes after performing anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures using a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance platforms. Thirteen patients underwent 15 SLCC procedures. The median age at surgery was 29 years (range 20-49 years), the median duration of epilepsy was 21 years (range 9-48 years), and median postablation follow-up was 20 months (range 4-44 months). Ten patients underwent anterior SLCC with a median 73% (range 33%-80%) midsagittal length of callosum acutely ablated. Following anterior SLCC, 6 of 10 patients achieved meaningful (> 50%) reduction of target seizures. Four patients underwent posterior (completion) SLCC following prior anterior callosotomy, and 1 patient underwent complete SLCC as a single procedure; 3 of these 5 patients experienced meaningful reduction of target seizures. Overall, 8 of 10 patients in whom astatic seizures were targeted and treated by anterior and/or posterior SLCC experienced meaningful improvement. SLCC procedures with direct MRI guidance (n = 7) versus a frameless surgical robot (n = 8) yielded median radial accuracies of 1.1 mm (range 0.2-2.0 mm) versus 2.4 mm (range 0.6-6.1 mm; p = 0.0011). The most serious adverse event was a clinically significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage in a patient who underwent the robotic technique. This is the largest reported series of SLCC for epilepsy to date. SLCC provides seizure outcomes comparable to open surgery outcomes reported in the literature. Direct MRI guidance is more accurate, which has the potential to reduce the risks of SLCC. Methodological advancements and larger studies are needed.

33584793	"Characteristics of Genetic Variations Associated With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in Korean Families.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of childhood-onset epilepsy characterized by multiple types of seizures, specific discharges on electroencephalography, and intellectual disability. Most patients with LGS do not respond well to drug treatment and show poor long-term prognosis. Approximately 30% of patients without brain abnormalities have unidentifiable causes. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and treatment of LGS remain challenging. To identify causative mutations of LGS, we analyzed the whole-exome sequencing data of 17 unrelated Korean families, including patients with LGS and LGS-like epilepsy without brain abnormalities, using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. We identified 14 mutations in 14 genes as causes of LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. 64 percent of the identified genes were reported as LGS or epilepsy-related genes. Many of these variations were novel and considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Network analysis was performed to classify the identified genes into two network clusters: neuronal signal transmission or neuronal development. Additionally, knockdown of two candidate genes with insufficient evidence of neuronal functions, SLC25A39 and TBC1D8, decreased neurite outgrowth and the expression level of MAP2, a neuronal marker. These results expand the spectrum of genetic variations and may aid the diagnosis and management of individuals with LGS.

33626200	"The role of surgery in the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of childhood onset epilepsy in which patients require multiple medications and may be candidates for palliative surgical intervention. In this meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the impact of palliative vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), corpus callosotomy (CC), and resective surgery (RS) by analyzing their impact on seizure control, antiepileptic drug (AED) usage, quality of life (QOL), behavior, cognition, prognostic factors, and complications. A systematic search of PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed to find articles that met the following criteria: (1) prospective/retrospective study with original data, (2) at least one LGS surgery patient aged less than 18 years, and (3) information on seizure frequency reduction (measured as percentage, Engel class, or qualitative comment). Seizures were analyzed quantitatively in a meta-analysis of proportions and a random-effects model, whereas other outcomes were analyzed qualitatively. Forty studies with 892 LGS patients met the selection criteria, with 19 reporting on CC, 17 on VNS, four on RS, two on RS + CC, one on CC + VNS, and one on deep brain stimulation. CC seizure reduction rate was 74.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 64.5%-83.7%), and VNS was 54.6% (95% CI = 42.9%-66.3%), which was significantly different (p < .001). RS seizure reduction was 88.9% (95% CI = 66.1%-99.7%). Many VNS patients reported alertness improvements, and most had no major complications. VNS was most effective for atonic/tonic seizures; higher stimulation settings correlated with better outcomes. CC patients reported moderate cognitive and QOL improvements; disconnection syndrome, transient weakness, and respiratory complications were noted. Greater callosotomy extent correlated with better outcomes. AED usage most often did not change after surgery. RS showed considerable QOL improvements for patients with localized seizure foci. In the reported literature, CC appeared to be more effective than VNS for seizure reduction. VNS may provide a similar or higher level of QOL improvement with lower aggregate risk of complications. Patient selection, anatomy, and seizure type will inform decision-making.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) of childhood. The Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) is established as a safe and effective treatment for DRE. This study assesses efficacy and tolerability of the auto-stimulation VNS models in pediatric patients with LGS. This is a retrospective chart review of a cohort of pediatric patients (Age 1-18 years old) with LGS implanted with an auto-stimulation VNS model at a single level four pediatric epilepsy center. Patient responder's rate was measured as seizure reduction over baseline and improvements in five quality-of-life measures as reported by the patients and families. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline. This cohort includes 71 consecutive children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent implantation with one of two models of the auto-stimulation VNS. The average age of the children at implantation was 20.82 months. Of those patients, 55 % of patients achieved greater than 50 % seizure reduction at six months, 67.7 % at 12 months, and 65 % at 24 months. At 12 months 11 % of the patients were completely seizure free and at 24 months 17 % were seizure free. By 24 months post implantation most of the patient families reported at least a 50 % improvement rate in one or more of the quality-of-life measures. The most commonly reported adverse events were dysphonia, paresthesia, and shortness of breath, all of which were tolerated and subsided by 24 months. This study provides evidence that VNS models with the auto-stimulation paradigm based on detection of tachycardia are well tolerated and effective in a pediatric population with LGS. Furthermore, this study shows that for this population, the auto-stimulation models of the VNS may provide additional benefits over the earlier VNS versions.

"	"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are among the most challenging of all epilepsies to manage, given the exceedingly frequent and often severe seizure types, pharmacoresistance to conventional antiseizure medications, and numerous comorbidities. During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.

"	"It is often difficult to diagnose epilepsy syndromes in resource-limited settings. This study was aimed to investigate the prospect of ascertaining the diagnosis, clinical profile, and treatment outcomes of epilepsy syndromes (ESs) among children in a resource-limited setting. This was a descriptive study done from 01/07/2009 to 15/06/2017 among children (1-17 years of age) with unprovoked seizures presenting to the pediatric neurology clinic of a university hospital in eastern Nepal. Diagnosis, classification, and treatment of seizures were based upon International League Against Epilepsy guidelines. Of 768 children with unprovoked seizures, 120 (15.6%) were diagnosed as ES. The age of onset of seizure was unique for each ES. Developmental delay and cerebral palsy were present in 47.5% and 28.3% children, respectively. Common ESs were West syndrome (WS)-26.7%, generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCSA)-21.7%, self-limited childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLCECTS)-12.5%, childhood absence epilepsy (CAE)-10.0%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)-10.0%, other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE)-5.8%, self-limited familial infantile epilepsy (SLFIE)-4.2%, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)-3.3%. Among children with known outcomes (87/120), overall response to pharmacotherapy and to monotherapy was observed in 72.4% (63/87) and 57.5% (50/87) children, respectively. All children with GTCSA, SLFIE, genetic epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+), CAE, SLCECTS, and JME responded to pharmacotherapy and they had normal computerized tomography scans of the brain. Seizures were largely pharmaco-resistant in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME)-100.0%, LGS-73.0%, WS-52.0%, and other DEEs-40%. A reasonable proportion (15.6%) of unprovoked seizures could be classified into specific ES despite limited diagnostic resources. WS was the most common ES. GTCSA, SLCECTS, CAE, and LGS were other common ESs. GTCSA, SLFIE, CAE, SLCECTS, GEFS+, and JME were largely pharmaco-responsive. PME, WS, and LGS were relatively pharmaco-resistant. Electro-clinical diagnosis of certain ES avoids the necessity of neuroimaging.

The aim of this study was to investigate the electroclinical features of patients with LGS during adulthood. We retrospectively identified the medical records of 20 patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of LGS from 3896 patients with epilepsy. Thirteen (65 %) patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 23.4 ± 7.1 (min-max; 18-43) years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 ± 4.5 (min-max; 1-14) years. The etiology was identified in 11 (55 %) patients. None of the patients achieved seizure freedom. The most prevalent seizure types were atypical absences in 14 (70 %) patients, tonic seizures in 13 (65 %) patients, and atonic seizures in 11 (55 %) patients. One (5 %) patient was diagnosed as having psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Mental retardation was reported in all patients and only half of them could walk independently. All patients had drug-resistant seizures and 16 (80 %) patients were on polytherapy. A vagus nerve stimulator was implanted into ten (50 %) patients and five reported 50-80 % seizure reduction. Ketogenic diet was administered to two (10 %) patients and epilepsy surgery was performed in two (10 %) patients with no significant benefit. Paying attention to all factors of seizure outcomes, cognitive impairment, and ambulatory status, all patients were dependent on caregivers for daily living abilities.

33745195	"How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome?
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping. The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors. With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD-associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY-9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS. Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in-depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021.

"	"Background and Aim: Data on the clinical pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol (CBD) are scanty. We explored the effect of demographic and clinical variables on plasma concentrations of purified CBD in patients with Dravet (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods: The study design was an open, prospective, multicenter expanded access program (EAP). Venous blood samples were drawn from patients between 8 and 9 am, before the CBD morning dose, 12 h apart from the last evening dose, and then 2.5 h after their usual morning dose. Results: We collected 127 plasma samples (67-morning pre-dosing and 60 post-dosing) from 43 patients (24 females, 19 males), 27 with LGS and 16 with DS. Mean ± standard deviation age was 26 ± 15 years. Duration of CBD treatment averaged 4.2 ± 2.9 months at 13.2 ± 4.6 mg/kg/day. CBD median trough plasma concentration was 91 ng/ml; it doubled to 190 ng/ml 2.5 h post-dosing (p < 0.001). Cannabidiol trough plasma concentrations were linearly related to daily doses (r = 0.564, p < 0.001). Median trough CBD plasma concentration-to-weight-adjusted dose ratio (C/D) was 32% higher (p < 0.02) in plasma samples from subjects aged 18 and over than in those under 18. Sex and concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) were not associated with significant variations in CBD C/D, but caution is required due to the potential influence of confounders. Conclusion: These are the first data on CBD pharmacokinetics in children and adults with LGS or DS in a real-world setting. The most relevant finding was the higher CBD C/D in adults. In practice, reduced weight-normalized doses might be required with aging to achieve the same CBD plasma levels.

To describe the characteristics of patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation. We reviewed clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics of 32 patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation, corresponding to 9 patients from the French PAH Network and 23 from literature analysis. These cases were compared with 370 patients from the French PAH Network (93 with a bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 [BMPR2] mutation and 277 considered as idiopathic cases without identified mutation). Distribution of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene in patients with PAH was compared with the HHT Mutation Database. At diagnosis, ACVRL1 mutation carriers were significantly younger (21.8 +/- 16.7 yr) than BMPR2 mutation carriers and noncarriers (35.7 +/- 14.9 and 47.6 +/- 16.3 yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). In seven of the nine patients from the French PAH Network, PAH diagnosis preceded manifestations of HHT. ACVRL1 mutation carriers had better hemodynamic status at diagnosis, but none responded to acute vasodilator challenge and they had shorter survival when compared with other patients with PAH despite similar use of specific therapies. ACVRL1 mutations in exon 10 were more frequently observed in patients with PAH, as compared with what was observed in the HHT Mutation Database (33.3 vs. 5%; P < 0.0001). ACVRL1 mutation carriers were characterized by a younger age at PAH diagnosis. Despite less severe initial hemodynamics and similar management, these patients had worse prognosis compared with other patients with PAH, suggesting more rapid disease progression.

"	"Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, we collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.

We studied the prevalence and size of pulmonary RLS in HHT type 1, HHT type 2, and HHT-negative controls, and its positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for PAVMs that can be treated by embolotherapy. In 343 consecutive persons referred for possible HHT as first-degree family members of index patients a TTCE and chest CT scan were performed. All persons were offered genetic analysis. An HHT-causing mutation was confirmed in 92 (mean age 41 ± 15 y; 59% female) HHT1 relatives and in 97 (mean age 47 ± 14 y; 52% female) HHT2 relatives. TTCE showed a pulmonary RLS in 78 (85%) HHT1- and 34 (35%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P < .0001). In HHT1 relatives, 29 of 53 (55%) PAVMs and in HHT2 relatives three of 17 (18%) PAVMS were treated, resulting in a PPV of TTCE for treatable PAVMs of 36.3% and 8.3%, respectively. The accompanying NPV was 100%. A minimal, moderate, or large shunt was present in 12 (13%), 24 (26%), and 42 (46%) HHT1-related, and in 20 (21%), 6 (6%), and 8 (8%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P for trend < .0001). A large shunt predicted treatable PAVMs in 55.8% of HHT1 relatives and 37.5% of HHT2 relatives. TTCE was positive in four (6%) of 63 persons without HHT. A pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in HHT1- compared with HHT2-related mutation carriers. Shunt grading is helpful to predict treatable PAVMs, particularly in the HHT2 group. TTCE is also positive in a small fraction of persons without HHT.

"	"Hepatic involvement occurs in up to 74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and is characterized by a spectrum of arteriovenous malformations. Three different types of intrahepatic shunting may be present: hepatic artery to hepatic veins, hepatic artery to portal vein, and portal vein to hepatic vein. Hepatic involvement in HHT may lead to biliary ischemia, portal hypertension, or high-output cardiac failure (HOCF). Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as the only definitive curative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hepatic involvement due to HHT after OLT with respect to mortality, cardiac and hepatic status, epistaxis, and quality of life. Patients with HHT and severe hepatic vascular malformations who underwent OLT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit (LLTU) from 1993 to 2007 were followed at the LLTU and the French Reference Center for HHT. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. There were 13 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria of the study (12 women and 1 man). The mean age at the time of OLT was 51.8 years (range = 33-65 years). Indications for OLT were cardiac failure (n = 9), biliary necrosis (n = 2), both cardiac failure and biliary necrosis (n = 1), and hemobilia (n = 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 109 months (range = 1-200 months). Twelve patients (92.3%) are still alive. For the 9 patients with HOCF, the mean cardiac index decreased from 5.4 L/minute/m(2) before OLT to 3.0 L/minute/m(2) after OLT. No severe hepatic complications were observed after OLT. Nine of the surviving patients (75%) experienced dramatic improvements in epistaxis and quality of life, including an ability to undertake more physical activity. In conclusion, OLT is an important therapeutic option for patients with HHT who have severe hepatic involvement. In the reported cohort, the mortality after OLT for this indication was low.

In many of the injected patients, the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment complications. Of the 58 treated patients 52 were contacted. Patient surveys were performed 1.5 to 46 months following their initial Bevacizumab treatment. Within the treatment population, five patients had sustained a septal perforation. Notably, these patients were treated early in the study period at which time the cartilaginous septum was often both injected and lasered. Subsequently, the treatment protocol was changed and the cartilaginous septum was neither lasered nor injected. After these changes were made no additional septal perforations were identified. No other adverse events were associated with intranasal Bevacizumab treatment. Bevacizumab applied as either a submucosal injection or as a topical nasal spray, with or without application of the KTP laser, is a safe treatment regimen. Still, when Bevacizumab injections are performed, the cartilaginous nasal septum should be avoided as patients may develop septal perforations.

21706320	"Efficiency of laser treatment in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Earlier studies have shown the effect of laser treatment on epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). At the present time, only very few prospective trials have been performed, and many studies are based on patients' subjective assessment of the severity of epistaxis. This prospective study measures the objective effect of laser treatment in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis. We introduce an objective measure to assess the severity of epistaxis: the bleeding time (BT). Before and after treatment, the quality of life, as measured by the patient, was assessed and compared to normative data. In 30 patients, we measured the BT before laser treatment 1.5 and 6.5 months after treatment. The Short form 36 (SF-36), a validated health questionnaire, was completed before and 6.5 months after treatment. Compared to preoperative value, BT was significantly reduced 1.5 and 6.5 months after laser treatment (p < 0.05) in both cases. No significant difference in quality of life, before and after treatment, was found. The quality of life of the HHT patients was reduced in five out of eight dimensions when compared with the Danish background population. Laser treatment reduces epistaxis in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis for at least 6 months; this group of patients have reduced quality of life compared to the background population.

Despite the young age, a lot of comorbidities were present: severe dyslipidemia, ischemic right cerebellar lesion, degenerative periventricular lesions, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, uterine fibroma, fibrocystic mastitis, polyglobulia of uncertain etiology and Rendu-Osler disease. The investigation which showed the nature of the pulmonary nodule was the CT scan with intravenous contrast, which demonstrated that the nodules were in fact arterial-venous malformations as part of the Rendu-Osler disease. This case offers the opportunity to discuss about etiopathogeny, morphopathology, criteria of diagnosis and treatment principles in Rendu-Osler disease.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia and severe, recurrent epistaxis is a common clinical phenotype associated with HHT. An intranasal treatment regime of diluted Avastin™ (Bevacizumab; recombinant humanized anti-vascular epithelial growth factor immunoglobin G1) using apulsatile nasal irrigator has proven efficacious in clinical practice. However, concerns regarding the stability of Avastin™ following dilution and prolonged storage in standard containers used for drug delivery, such as polyethylene bottles, have so far prevented a more widespread clinical use. Compatibility with the preservative benzalkonium chloride was also unknown. This study aimed at determining, whether dilution, prolonged refrigerated storage and the presence of the preservative benzalkonium chloride - as required for novel Avastin™ formulations - affected the biochemical and electrochemical properties of the drug. We performed a detailed biochemical and electrochemical analysis of Avastin™, including native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isoelectric focusing. We did not detect any evidence of degeneration or aggregation following dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage or from the presence of benzalkonium chloride. All biochemical and electrochemical properties of Avastin™ after dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage were undistinguishable from control. Our data provide important insight into the stability of Avastin™ and allow the consideration of novel Avastin™ formulations, including its use in a metered-dose nasal spray for the treatment of HHT and other applications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by systemic vascular diseases mainly shown as arterio-visnous fistula (AVF). Here, we presented a 29-year-old woman with HHT complicated with migraine with aura (MWA) and vertigo. At the age of twelve years, she developed migraine with visual aura. At that time, migraine attacks were seen three times a year. At the age of 29 years, she also developed speech disturbance as migraine aura. At the ages of 20 and 29 years, she repeatedly suffered from positional vertigo attacks for a month. Physical examination revealed dilation of the capillary vessels at tongue, soft palate, and nasal mucosa and AVFs were located in the upper cervical cord, parietal lobe, and bilateral lungs. These clinical findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of HHT. Embolization of pulmonary AVF decreased the frequency of migraine attacks during 2-year follow-up after the embolization. The frequency of migraine in patients with HHT is higher than that of general population as well as the prevalence of vertigo. Therefore, MWA and vertigo presented in the patient with HHT suggests that there is a common pathological mechanism of dysfunction of endothelial cells and R-L shunt, among HHT, MWA, and vertigo.

"	"SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

For transfusion-dependent patients with severe epistaxis we have been performing the Young's procedure or surgical closure of the nostrils. The objective of this study was to report treatment of severe epistaxis related to HHT with the Young's procedure and assess patient outcome. Patients with severe iron or blood transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a Young's procedure in three otolaryngology HHT centers were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for postoperative epistaxis and subjective outcome. Forty-three patients underwent a Young's procedure for severe epistaxis and were observed for a mean of 34 months. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients and 30 of 36 patients (83%) experienced complete cessation of bleeding after the Young's procedure. Patients had a mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.68 g/dL after the procedure. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory score after surgery was 43.56. No patients requested a reversal of the procedure. The Young's procedure is a safe and efficacious procedure with complete cessation of epistaxis in most patients with severe epistaxis and HHT.

"	"The olfactory and gustatory functions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients have not been documented by validated tests. Disorders of the nasal/oral cavity may interfere with the olfactory and gustatory functions. Fifty-four HHT patients were investigated by smell/taste tests. HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests. HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder causing mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered an uncommon complication of HHT whose impact on the survival of these patients is currently unknown. From January 1995 to December 2008, 29 hospitalized patients with definite HHT were included and followed until January 2011. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. PH was classified according to echocardiographic probability. A CT angiogram was performed in 24 of the 29 patients with HHT and AVMs were detected in 16 of them (67%): hepatic in 58%, pulmonary in 33% and spinal in 3%; 37% had both pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 21 patients. PH was considered possible in 4 (14%) and probable in 9 (31%). The mean age at diagnosis was lower in patients with PH than in patients without PH (54±16.5 years vs 73±8.8 years, p=0.002). PH was more prevalent in patients with AVMs (56 vs. 23%, p=0.036). The mean follow-up of the entire cohort was 6±4.4 years (range: 2 months-17 years), during this time 18 patients died (62%; mean age 73±8.1 years). Patients with PH died at a younger age (68±8.4 vs. 79±2.7 years, p=0.015) than those without PH. PH is a severe condition that significantly reduces survival on HHT patients. PH should be suspected in all HHT patients with dyspnea and hepatic AVMs.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.

"	"Targeted ultrasound contrast imaging has the potential to become a reliable molecular imaging tool. A better understanding of the quantitative aspects of molecular ultrasound technology could facilitate the translation of this technique to the clinic for the purposes of assessing vascular pathology and detecting individual response to treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether targeted ultrasound contrast-enhanced imaging can provide a quantitative measure of endogenous biomarkers. Endoglin, an endothelial biomarker involved in the processes of development, vascular homeostasis, and altered in diseases, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 and tumor angiogenesis, was the selected target. We used a parallel plate perfusion chamber in which endoglin-targeted (MBE), rat isotype IgG2 control and untargeted microbubbles were perfused across endoglin wild-type (Eng+/+), heterozygous (Eng+/-) and null (Eng-/-) embryonic mouse endothelial cells and their adhesion quantified. Microbubble binding was also assessed in late-gestation, isolated living transgenic Eng+/- and Eng+/+ embryos. Nonlinear contrast-specific ultrasound imaging performed at 21 MHz was used to collect contrast mean power ratios for all bubble types. Statistically significant differences in microbubble binding were found across genotypes for both in vitro (p<0.05) and embryonic studies (p<0.001); MBE binding was approximately twofold higher in Eng+/+ cells and embryos compared with their Eng+/- counterparts. These results suggest that molecular ultrasound is capable of reliably differentiating between molecular genotypes and relating receptor densities to quantifiable molecular ultrasound levels.

The genes known to be associated with HHT include ENG (HHT1), ACVRL1 (HHT2) and SMAD4 (JPHT). It has been reported that circulating CD34(+) cell subsets repair damaged vessels. To investigate whether mobilization of these cells is present in the peripheral blood (PB) of HTT patients, we analyzed CD34(+) cells, CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+) progenitor or mature endothelial cells, and CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed in 150 HTT patients and 43 healthy subjects (CTRLs). In HTT patients, PB CD34(+) cells were significantly increased; the frequency of endothelial cells was higher (P = 0.002), while the frequency of CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) HPCs was lower (P = 0.00007) than in CTRLs. Results were comparable in patients with ENG or ACVRL1 gene mutation; in patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of the cell subsets inversely correlated with the age of the patients at time of sampling (CD34(+)), disease duration (CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+)), and age at disease onset (CD34(+)CD133(+) VEGFR-2(-)). In conclusion, HHT patients show an increase of circulating endothelial cells and a decrease of HPCs. In patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of CD34(+) endothelial cells correlates with specific clinical characteristics suggesting that their active turnover characterizes the initial phase of the disease.

Demographic, clinical, genotypic, and imaging information of 75 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with brain arteriovenous malformations enrolled in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium from 2010 to 2012 were reviewed. Nonshunting, small, superficially located conglomerates of enhancing vessels without enlarged feeding arteries or draining veins called ""capillary vascular malformations"" were the most commonly observed lesion (46 of 75 patients; 61%), followed by shunting ""nidus-type"" brain AVMs that were typically located superficially with a low Spetzler-Martin Grade and a small size (32 of 75 patients; 43%). Direct high-flow fistulous arteriovenous shunts were present in 9 patients (12%). Other types of vascular malformations (dural AVF and developmental venous anomalies) were present in 1 patient each.

Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.

Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway.

"	"The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients. Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.

This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013. Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient. The technique is described. We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure. The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3. Comparison of 5 patients who underwent the traditional 3-flap nasal closure procedure and 8 patients receiving the 2-flap nasal closure showed no significant difference in postoperative ESS or GBI metrics. Mean operating room times of the traditional and simplified methods were 3.12 hours and 1.44 hours (p = 0.0001). Mean time to first revision for 8 nasal closure patients was 21.5 months. In short-term follow-up, the 2-flap procedure showed comparable effectiveness with significantly reduced complexity and operative time compared to the traditional nasal closure method.

During his stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, treatment was initiated with inhaled nitric oxide and intravenous epoprostenol; he subsequently was transitioned to treprostinil, sildenafil, and prophylactic enoxaparin. Now, two years later, the child is asymptomatic on sildenafil, bosentan, subcutaneous treprostinil, and warfarin. Genetic screening revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the BMP9 gene (c.76C > T; p.Gln26Ter). The child had no telangiectasias or arteriovenous malformations; family history also was negative. Subsequent parental testing showed both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation, indicating that the child inherited the BMP9 mutant allele from each parent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP9 mutation in a patient with PAH. The homozygous nonsense mutation may account for the early onset and severity of PAH in this patient and also fit the 'two-hit' model we proposed previously. The absence of clinical symptoms for PAH in the parents may be due to incomplete penetrance or various expressivities of the BMP9 mutations. Our study expands the spectrum of phenotypes related to BMP9 mutations.

"	"Olfactory schwannomas of the anterior cranial base (ACB) are rare tumors and their association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) has not previously been described. The majority of ACB schwannomas arise from the sinonasal tracts and may demonstrate intracranial extension. We report a case of an olfactory schwannoma dense adherence to the basal frontal lobe . Complete tumor resection was performed through a unilateral extended endonasal endoscopic approach with preservation of the contralateral olfactory bulb. Anterior cranial base repair was achieved with a contralateral mucoperichondrial vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap. A twenty-five-year-old female with a history of migraines presented with unilateral epistaxis and progressive worsening of her headache symptoms. The patient had a history of HHT. Nasal endoscopy showed mild telangiectasias, but no clear evidence of a mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large left-sided expansile lesion in the left ethmoid region with expansion and remodeling of the anterior cranial base mass and medial left orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed the mass to be avidly enhancing. Angiography was performed and demonstrated a mild vascular blush. We report a rare case of HTT and olfactory schwannoma completely resected with a unilateral extended endoscopic endonasal approach. Reconstruction was performed with a contralateral nasoseptal flap. This is the first reported single stage fully endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach for resection of an olfactory schwannoma with preservation of the contralateral olfactory cleft. The patient's sense of smell and taste was maintained postoperatively.

"	"A 72-year-old female patient presented with increasing dyspnea of unclear origin classified as New York Heart Association stage III (NYHA III). Using transesophageal echocardiography a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and right heart failure could be diagnosed. Right heart catheterization revealed a large left to right shunt due to an arteriovenous malformation in the liver. Because of additional telangiectasia of the lips the presumptive diagnosis was Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. Typical nosebleeds and other symptoms of the disease were lacking and only two out of four Curaçao criteria were positive; therefore, genetic testing was performed, which verified the clinical diagnosis. Off-label use of the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab was initiated as the therapeutic strategy and led to an improvement in the symptomatic dyspnea.

"	"An intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula(dAVF)was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old man during a medical checkup. Except for a mild episode of pneumonia at the age of 22 years, his medical history was unremarkable. He had no family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia(HHT). The dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.

"	"To evaluate if injection of intravenous particles may provoke migraines in subjects with right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Migraine headaches commonly affect people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), especially those with pulmonary AVMs that provide right-to-left shunts. In our clinical practice, patients occasionally reported acute precipitation of migraine headaches following injection of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates for nuclear medicine scans. Self-reported migraine features and exacerbations were examined in HHT subjects with and without pulmonary AVMs, for a series of noninvasive and invasive investigations, using an unbiased online survey. One hundred and sixty-six subjects were classified as having both HHT and migraines. HHT subjects with migraines were more likely to have pulmonary AVMs (P < .0001). HHT subjects with pulmonary AVMs were more likely to report photophobia (P = .010), ""flashes of light"" (P = .011), or transient visual loss (P = .040). Pulse oximetry, x-rays, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans without intravenous contrast medium rarely, if ever, provoked migraines, but unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to exacerbate migraines by 14/124 (11.2%) subjects. One hundred and fourteen subjects had both enhanced and unenhanced CT examinations: studies with contrast media were more commonly reported to start (9/114 [7.8%]), and/or worsen migraines (18/114 [15.7%]), compared to those undertaken without contrast medium (P < .01), or after simple blood tests (P < .05). Additionally, migraine exacerbation was reported by 9/90 (10%) after contrast echocardiography, 2/44 (4.5%) after nuclear medicine scans, and 10/154 (6.5%) after blood tests. HHT subjects frequently report migraine exacerbation following blood tests, contrast echocardiograms, MRI imaging, and CT studies performed with intravenous contrast medium. Since air emboli are recognized to complicate intravenous injections, particularly those given by a pressurized pump during contrast enhanced CT, future studies should re-evaluate whether particulate emboli provoke migraines.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited autosomal dominant disease presenting with recurrent bleeding episodes and iron deficiency anemia due to vascular malformations. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in mainly two genes, that is ENG, encoding endoglin (HHT1), or ACVRL1, encoding activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1/HHT2). HHT is characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and vascular visceral dysplasia responsible for visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). to report the experience of two university hospitals (Trousseau, Paris, and CHIC, Creteil) with screening children for HHT and pulmonary AVM (PAVM) using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). parents with confirmed HHT were offered to have their children screened for the mutation identified in their family, and informed consent was obtained. Children carrying the same mutation as their parents underwent HRCT of the chest without contrast. between 2008 and 2015, 99 children were screened for HHT mutations. Mutations were identified in 59 patients, that is 24 HHT1 and 35 HHT2. Radiologic and clinical screening was possible in 52 patients (21 HHT-1 and 31 HHT-2). Among those, PAVM was identified in 13 patients (25%; n = 8 HHT1; n = 5 HHT2), and four of them required embolization therapy. This study highlights the usefulness of genetic screening in children with known HHT family. It also suggests that a non-invasive protocol such as HRTC is an efficient approach to detect non-symptomatic lesions that are present early on in children carrying the ENG (HHT1), but also the ACVRL1 mutations (HHT2).

"	"Use of reliable grading scores to measure epistaxis severity in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is essential in clinical routine and for scientific purposes. For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.

28407366	"Screening children for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Evaluation of 18 years of experience
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with multi-systemic vascular dysplasia. Early diagnosis through screening is important to prevent serious complications. How best to screen children of affected parents for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is often subject to debate. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram (TTCE) is considered optimal in screening for PAVMs in adults. Guidelines for the screening of children are not specific, reflecting the lack of scientific evidence on the best method to use. Aims of this study are (i) to evaluate our current screening method, consisting of history, physical examination, pulse oximetry, and chest radiography and (ii) to assess whether postponing more invasive screening for PAVMs until adulthood is safe. This is a prospective observational cohort study using a patient database. Over a period of 18 years (mean follow-up 9.21 years, SD 4.72 years), 436 children from HHT families were screened consecutively. A total of 175/436 (40%) children had a diagnosis of HHT. PAVMs were detected in 39/175 (22%) children, 33/39 requiring treatment by embolotherapy. None of the screened children suffered any PAVM-associated complications with this screening method. This study shows that a conservative screening method during childhood is sufficient to detect large PAVMs and protect children with HHT for PAVM-related complications. Postponing TTCE and subsequent chest CT scanning until adulthood to detect any smaller PAVMs does not appear to be associated with major risk.

"	"The liver has a complex vascular supply, which involves the inflow of oxygenated blood through the hepatic artery (systemic circulation) and deoxygenated blood through the portal vein (portal circulation), as well as the outflow of deoxygenated blood through the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava. A spectrum of vascular variants can involve the liver. Some of these variants may result in areas of enhancement that can mimic more serious pathologic conditions. In this article, the authors discuss a spectrum of variants and pathologic conditions that may involve the liver vasculature. These include variants, anomalies, and diseases involving the portal vein, such as rudimentary portal vein, thrombosis, cavernous transformation, thrombotic angiitis, thrombophlebitis, transient hepatic attenuation difference or transient hepatic intensity difference, portal venous aneurysm, and portal vein gas. The hepatic artery can be involved by various diseases, including thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Unusual ""third inflow"" sources of venous inflow are also discussed, including aberrant right gastric vein, aberrant left gastric vein, epigastric-paraumbilical veins, and cholecystic vein. A spectrum of variants and diseases involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, including thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, stenosis, torsion, congestive hepatopathy, and peliosis hepatis, are discussed. Vascular shunts are illustrated, including portosystemic shunts (intra- and extrahepatic), arterioportal shunt, shunts of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and acquired arteriovenous fistula. Familiarity with the pathogenesis and imaging features of these vascular entities can aid radiologic diagnoses and guide appropriate patient management. (©)RSNA, 2017.

Little is known about pCLE imaging deep inside the small bowel, therefore the aim of this study was to determine its usefulness. Between April 2014 and January 2016, we performed 38 pCLE examinations during double-balloon enteroscopy with intravenous fluorescein in 37 patients with: tumors (n = 10), vascular disorders (n = 6), inflammatory diseases and drug injuries (n = 13), other disorders (n = 4), and normal findings (n = 4). We measured the calibers of capillary and lymphatic vessels at 15 different sites and compared the calibers between pCLE images and histopathology. We also compared pCLE findings with pathologic diagnosis. The inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology. In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %). pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.

In this retrospective study, we identified all patients at our institution diagnosed with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia from 2001 to 2017. Patients who did not undergo brain MR imaging were excluded. Patient demographics, laboratory results, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease characteristics were noted. Basal ganglia hyperintensity was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively relative to the signal intensity in the ipsilateral thalami. Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available software. A total of 312 patients (41% men, 59% women; mean age, 51 ± 18 years) with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were identified. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity was present in 23.4% of patients and demonstrated a statistically significant association with older age (P < .001), increased hepatic AVMs (P < .001), high cardiac output state (P < .001), hepatic failure (P = .01), elevated peak serum alkaline phosphatase level (P = .03), and increased total bilirubin count (P = .03). There was no significant association with sex, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia genetic mutation status, parkinsonism, or serum transaminase levels. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity occurs in >23% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is associated with hepatic vascular malformations, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated cardiac output. The presence of this finding on screening MR imaging in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should prompt further evaluation for visceral lesions causing arteriovenous shunting.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

"	"To present a multiyear clinical experience with intravenous bevacizumab for the management of severe gastrointestinal bleeding and/or epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). All patients treated with intravenous bevacizumab for severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related bleeding from June 1, 2013, through January 31, 2017, were included in this report. Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients. Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores (P<.001) and RBC transfusion requirements (P=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function. Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship as well as clinical, genetic, and biomarker predictors of response.

Nine newly diagnosed HHT-PAH patients were prospectively recruited between October 2007 and January 2016 and were followed up every half-year. Eighteen idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients, matched with HHT-PAH patients on mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), were recruited. The clinical characteristics of HHT-PAH patients were described and the prognosis of these two cohorts were compared. Of HHT-PAH patients, 55.56% were WHO FC III. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed one- and three-year survival rates of HHT-PAH patients were 77.8% and 53.3% respectively, which were worse than matched IPAH patients (log rank: P = 0.047). HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid. HHT-PAH patients may have a worse prognosis than matched IPAH patients. Baseline total bilirubin may be a promising predictor for the long-term prognosis in HHT-PAH patients.

Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton, sight organ, skin, lungs, heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage, especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels.Aim: To evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias.Study design: Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias, including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome (I group), 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (II group), and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) (III group) of the age from 18 to 36. The study included retrospective analysis (for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery, especially the risk of hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vessel growth that results in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia. We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea. Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.

We report a prospective, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalating study [50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg], designed as a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate efficacy of pazopanib on HHT-related bleeding, and to measure safety. Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE. In conclusion, we observed an improvement in Hgb and/or epistaxis in all treated patients. This occurred at a dose much lower than typically used for oncologic indications, with no serious AE. Further studies of pazopanib efficacy are warranted.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with HHT can develop vascular dysplasias called telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.

"	"Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. We provide a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT, with a focus on the risk of recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010, with a survival of more than 1 year. Protocol clinical, radiological, and histological examinations were performed at regular intervals. Fourteen patients were included (13 women and one man). Median age at LT was 52.5 years (range: 33.1-66.7). In eight patients (seven female), disease recurrence was diagnosed by abnormal radiological features, suggestive of microcirculatory disturbances. Typical vascular lesions, including telangiectasia, were demonstrated by liver biopsy in five of these patients. The median interval between LT and diagnosis of recurrence was 127 months (range: 74-184). The risk of recurrence increased over time; estimated cumulative risk was 47.9% at 15 years. Liver tissue analysis found the coexistence of an angiogenic process combined with endothelial microchimerism, as shown by the presence of vascular lining cells of recipient origin. Conclusion: The present data show that disease recurrence occurs, usually after a long delay, in a significant number of patients treated by LT for liver complications of HHT. This strongly supports the necessity of a lifelong follow-up and suggests that therapeutic strategy needs discussion and evaluation, especially of the role of potential adjuvant treatments to LT, such as antiangiogenic medications, when recurrent disease appears.

30888464	"Abdominal manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a series of 333 patients over 15 years
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.

British Thoracic Society Clinical Statement considered insufficient evidence of safety or clinical benefit to recommend thrombolysis for stroke with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. For pulmonary arteriovenous malformations with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, bleeding risk after thrombolysis is high, while for isolate pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, bleeding risk is much lower. We here present 2 cases of ischemic stroke with isolate pulmonary arteriovenous malformations treated with thrombolysis. Right-to-left shunt was found by contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler in these 2 patients and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were confirmed by contrast-transthoracic echocardiography and thoracic computed tomography angiography. Neurological signs improved after intravenous thrombolysis without bleeding complication.

31360828	"Topically Applied Etamsylate: A New Orphan Drug for HHT-Derived Epistaxis (Antiangiogenesis through FGF Pathway Inhibition)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea. We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: (""hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia"" AND ""Korea"") OR (""Osler-Weber-Rendu"" AND ""Korea""). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea. We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations. The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often involves the liver, and belongs to abnormal blood vessel disease. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is not clear, but congenital vascular dysplasia is considered to be one of the causes. Liver cirrhosis due to hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia concomitant with BCS has not been reported. Here, we report a case of cirrhosis with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHHT) and BCS. A 58-year-old woman with hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia showed decompensated liver cirrhosis, and abdominal imaging revealed Budd-Chiari syndrome. Disease has progressed considerably during 2.5 years after hospital discharge despite subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). One hypothesis that might explain the coexistence of hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome in this patient is ischemia and thrombosis of hepatic veins. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between HHHT and BCS. Our observations already challenged the TIPS therapeutic strategy in BCS secondary to HHHT patients.

The indications for treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in young patients remain controversial because the risk of complications concerning pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is lower in young patients than in adult patients. We recommend that aggressive treatment should be performed for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis with a family history of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture even if the patient is asymptomatic and young, because such patients may have a high risk of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula rupture.

Retrospective cohort study of 54 children diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at a tertiary care center. All neuroimaging was reviewed to assess for number and types of cerebrovascular malformations and for intracerebral hemorrhage and arterial ischemic stroke. Clinical charts were reviewed for clinical manifestations, genetic mutation, and clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhages and arterial ischemic strokes. Among 54 children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a median age of 3.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 7.9 years) at diagnosis, neuroimaging was performed in 52 (96.3%) at a median age of 5.2 years (interquartile range 1.8 to 9 years). Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The three children with intracerebral hemorrhage presented at young ages (4.3 to 7.7 years). More than a quarter of children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who were imaged had cerebrovascular malformations, and overt stroke occurred in more than 10%. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients at young ages, and new cerebral arteriovenous malformations may develop over time. Early screening with neuroimaging including neurovascular imaging as well as repeat neuroimaging may be warranted in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Computed tomography (CT) showed apical bullae on both sides of the upper lobe. We clarified the location of PAVMs by 3D-CT to avoid the massive bleeding caused by careless grasping of PAVMs and unintentional incomplete resection of the PAVMs during the pneumothorax surgery. Considering the risk of exacerbation, the patient underwent bullectomy of the left upper lobe. The postoperative histopathological examination indicated that the pneumothorax occurred spontaneously in the HHT patient.

33242965	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation managed by VATS lobectomy
"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is formed by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins that bypass the pulmonary capillaries and transport deoxygenated blood through pulmonary veins to the left heart. This causes insufficient oxygenation of blood in the lungs. This condition remains symptomless for a long period of time. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, nosebleeds, increased fatigue and a gradual development of cyanosis. Paradoxical embolism in the brain is a serious complication; it can present with a stroke or a brain abscess. Treatment of the disease consists of embolization of the pathological vascular connections, surgical resection of the affected pulmonary parenchyma and management of concomitant manifestations of the disease. PAVM in most common cases arises as a result of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder referred to as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Case report: In our communication, we document the diagnostic and therapeutic management in a young patient diagnosed with PAVM after falling off his bicycle. Based on comprehensive assessments, AV malformations with a 40% shunt of the pulmonary circulation were detected. An angiographic procedure was not an appropriate option considering the type and extent of the condition. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic resection of the affected pulmonary lobe was indicated. Conclusion: PAVM is a rare finding. PAVM should be ruled out in all patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) signs in the oral cavity. Contrast sonography of the heart and contract CT of the chest are the methods of choice for the diagnosis. Conservative or pharmacological treat-ment fails to improve the patients status.  The condition is usually managed by embolization. Cases where PAVM is rather extensive or diffuse, where endovascular management would be inappropriate, can be well managed using endoscopic resection adequate to the extent of the condition.

33498134	"Novel Protein Interactions with Endoglin and Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1: Potential Role in Vascular Networks.
"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

A retrospective comparison of efficacy was therefore conducted for both forms of application. Between 1989 and 2001, a series of 11 children with West syndrome and 3 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (group 1); between 2003 and 2006, 7 children with West syndrome, 5 with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep, and 2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with pulsatile corticoid therapy (group 2). In group 1 (n = 14), 9/11 West syndrome patients became seizure free, but none with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (0/3). In group 2 (n = 14), 4/7 West syndrome patients became seizure-free, 1/2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome exhibited seizure-frequency reduction, and 2/5 patients with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep exhibited significant improvement according to electroencephalograms. In West syndrome, pulsatile corticoid therapy was an effective alternative treatment to adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in general steroids did not lead to a significant seizure reduction. In electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, treatment with pulsatile corticoid therapy seems to be effective and should be investigated in a larger group of patients.

"	"Late-onset spasms (LOS) are epileptic spasms starting after the first year of life. Our aim was to assess the electroclinical features and the follow-up of the patients with this particular type of epileptic seizure. We retrospectively included all patients with LOS confirmed by electroencephalography between 1989 and 2008. Clinical and electroencephalographic findings at diagnosis and during follow-up were collected. The Vineland scale was used to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome. We report 19 patients with LOS of 240 patients with recorded epileptic spasms. Eighteen patients had an epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. The ictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed a focal or generalized discharge of triphasic slow-waves, slow-spikes, or slow spikes-waves with fast activities. The interictal EEG usually showed focal or generalized slow-waves or slow spikes-waves without hypsarhythmia. LOS were controlled in only six patients. Three developed typical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 10 had a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Neuropsychological outcome was evaluated in 15 patients with the Vineland scale. Cognitive functions were normal in only one patient, whereas severe cognitive delay was observed in 12 of 15. Epileptic spasms may appear after the age of one. They are more frequently observed in patients with epileptic encephalopathy. In few patients this type of seizure was observed before the patients fulfill Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria. In one patient, we diagnosed a focal epilepsy with seizures occurring in cluster. When LOS are related to an epileptic encephalopathy, this epileptic syndrome seems to be linked to refractory epilepsy and severe cognitive outcome unrelated to the etiology.

Many epidemiological studies have been published, but with rather discordant results, because of methodological differences. In our context, epilepsy constitutes a public health problem. National epidemiological data are scarce. To describe the characteristics of children with epilepsy, to analyze the risk factors and to assess the impact of the disease on schooling. This was a retrospective study concerning 592 children attending the Mohammed VI university hospital center pediatric unit A outpatient clinic for epilepsy from August 2003 to December 2007. Epileptic syndromes were classified according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy of 1989. Prevalence of epilepsy was 8.5%. Average age was 6 years 7 months. Age of seizure onset ranged from 2 months to 14 years. Male gender predominated. Antecedents were dominated by peri- and neonatal complications. Parental consanguinity and a family history of epilepsy were found in 19.2 and 11.6% of cases, respectively. Schooling was perturbed in more than one-third of the school-age children. Generalized seizures were most common (70.5%). Association with cerebral palsy was present in 18.6% of cases, with mental retardation in 4.7%. The epilepsy was idiopathic for 41% of the children, symptomatic for 39% and cryptogenic for 20%. Generalized epileptic syndromes were the most frequent, epilepsy absence (12%), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (6%), West syndrome (5.5%) and myoclonic epilepsy (4%). The most common partial epileptic idiopathic syndrome was benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. Single-drug therapy was the rule for first intention treatment (96.8%). Sodium valproate was the antiepileptic drug most widely used (82%). Treatment led to resolution of the seizures in 76% of the children.

20666130	"Treatment of childhood epilepsies: Japanese Expert Consensus study and a comparison of the results with those of the USA and EU
"	"We conducted a Japanese Expert Consensus (EC) study for the treatment of childhood epilepsies following the method reported from the USA and EU (Wheless JW, et al., 2005, 2007), and compared the results to reveal differences in the choice of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The subjects were 41 pediatric board-certified epileptologists who responded to the 23 questionnaires. A 9-point scale was used to grade each AED, in which 9 was the best whereas 1 was the worst for appropriateness of choice for each epileptic syndrome. Lamotrigine (LTG) is frequently used for idiopathic generalized epilepsy except for valproate sodium (VPA) in both the USA and EU, while VPA and clonazepam were the main AEDs in Japan. For cryptogenic complex partial epilepsy and benign focal epilepsy, carbamazepine was a first-line AED among the USA, EU, and Japan, although other first-line AEDs were oxcarbamazepine (OCBZ), LTG, and levetiracetam (LEV) in both the USA and EU, while it was zonisamide in Japan. Regarding the treatment for symptomatic generalized epilepsy, West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, VPA and ACTH were first-line AEDs commonly used in the USA, EU, and Japan, while the other first-line AEDs were topiramate (TPM) and LTG in the USA and EU, and CZP and clobazam in Japan. This Japanese EC study demonstrated the difference in the selection of AEDs for epileptic syndromes between the USA and EU, which use more newly-introduced AEDs including TPM, LTG, OCBZ and LEV as first-and second-line AEDs, and Japan.

"	"The treatment of epilepsy is complicated by the multiple seizure types and epilepsy syndromes needing therapy. In addition, seizures in up to 30% of epilepsy patients are resistant to available medications. The three newest antiepileptic medications (lacosamide, rufinamide, and vigabatrin) all putatively have novel mechanisms of action, which might increase the chance of treatment success in patients failing previous antiepilepsy drug trials and the chance of successful synergy with currently available medications. In our experience, all three drugs generally are well tolerated, although the risk for serious long-term complications with vigabatrin presents special challenges and precautions. Lacosamide is approved for the adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures in adults and also is available in an intravenous formulation. Rufinamide is a new treatment option for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and although it is not FDA approved for partial seizures, it has shown efficacy for that indication as well. Vigabatrin has been approved in adults for drug-resistant complex partial seizures and in infants as a treatment option for infantile spasms.

"	"We performed STXBP1 mutation analyses in 86 patients with various types of epilepsies, including 10 patients with OS, 43 with West syndrome, 2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 with symptomatic generalized epilepsy, 14 with symptomatic partial epilepsy, and 5 with other undetermined types of epilepsy. In all patients, the etiology was unknown, but ARX and CDKL5 mutations were negative in all cases. All coding exons of STXBP1 were analyzed by direct-sequencing. Two de novo nucleotide alterations of STXBP1 were identified in two patients with Ohtahara and West syndrome, respectively. No de novo or deleterious mutations in STXBP1 were found in the remaining 84 patients with various types of symptomatic epilepsies. This is the first case report showing that STXBP1 mutations caused West syndrome from the onset of epilepsy. STXBP1 analysis should be considered as an etiology of symptomatic West syndrome without explainable cause.

"	"In the treatment of epilepsy, selecting an appropriate antiepileptic drug for each individual patient requires matching the patient's clinical needs with the agent's specific pharmacological attributes. In many situations, the final choice of an antiepileptic drug may need a change due to the agent's side-effect profile. The authors report a ten-year-old child with Lennox Gastaut syndrome who developed recurrence of seizures, hyperammonemic encephalopathy and cerebellar atrophy on valproate therapy. Valproate was discontinued and lamotrigine was added followed by good control of seizures. Cerebellar atrophy as a serious adverse side effect of valproate therapy, has been infrequently reported.

"	"To compare the prognoses between short-term (8 months) and conventional long-term (> 2 years) trials involving patients with refractory infantile spasms who successfully completed the ketogenic diet (KD). Of 40 patients who achieved seizure-free outcomes and showed improvement in hypsarrhythmic patterns within 6 months of the KD, with a 3:1 fat to nonfat ratio as an add-on treatment, 16 patients were randomized into the short-term trial group and the diet was tapered throughout two additional months. Twenty-four patients were randomized into a long-term trial group, and 19 patients could successfully discontinue the diet after 2 years. Primary outcome measures included seizure relapse and frequency of 35 patients for > 12 months after successful completion of the KD. Of 16 patients in the short-term trial group, two patients relapsed with clusters of spasms, and one patient had recurrence of occasional focal seizures. Of 19 patients in the long-term trial group, two patients progressed to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and one patient experienced recurrence of occasional focal seizures with secondary generalization. An early response to the KD, evidenced by short latency before seizure freedom and disappearance of hypsarrythmia and cryptogenic etiology, may indicate a successful early discontinuation of the KD. Significant growth failure was complicated only in conventional long-term trial group. Use of the KD for only 8 months in children who become spasm-free appears to be justified, with similar outcomes, recurrence rate, and less growth disturbance than a longer-term, traditional use.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy that starts in childhood and has an unknown pathophysiological mechanism. Studies on the progress of LGS reveal a poor prognosis. A retrospective study of 1629 patients with epilepsy was conducted. Patients included in the study were those with an age of onset during childhood, tonic seizures and atypical absences (who might also suffer from other types of seizures); electroencephalogram (EEG) showing generalised slow spike-wave and generalised fast activity; mental retardation and a follow-up time of at least 10 years. The sample consisted of 12 patients, 9 of whom were males. Follow-up time: 20 years. Onset of seizures: 3 years. Cryptogenic LGS: 67%; symptomatic: 33%. Frequency of the seizures at onset: daily (83.3%) or weekly (16.7%). Types of seizures: tonic and atypical absences (100%); drop-attacks (83%); generalised tonic-clonic (75%); myoclonias (41.7%); partial (8.3%) and pseudo-epileptic (8.3%). EEG with slow background activity, generalised slow spike-wave and generalised fast activity: 100%. Fifty percent of the patients had at least one epileptic status. They used an average of 7.5 different antiepileptic drugs. At the end of the follow-up 33% were suffering from seizures on a daily basis; 17% were weekly and 42% monthly. A total of 8.3% were free from seizures. All of them were following combination therapy: 17% in bitherapy and 83% with an average of 3.8 drugs (range: 3-5). A total of 92% suffered from severe or very severe mental retardation. Fifty percent required neuroleptic drugs due to behavioural disorders. Despite the fact that the diagnosis of LGS is serious, we observed a decrease in the number of seizures after several years of development, although the antiepileptic combination therapy remains constant. The mental retardation and behavioural disorders lead to a poor functional prognosis.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a well-defined epileptic encephalopathy highly drug resistant. The first-line treatment option is valproate (VPA), usually in combination with lamotrigine. VPA has been linked to serious hepatotoxicity. We report a 22-year-old liver transplanted patient with LGS successfully treated with VPA in combination with phenobarbital (100 mg/d; blood level: 36 mg/l), lamotrigine (125 mg/d; blood level: 4.81 mg/l) and topiramtate (175 mg/d), as well as immunosuppressive, antiviral, anti-anemic, hypo-phosphoric and alkaline medication. On VPA 1000 mg/d, the seizure frequency decreased significantly. Taking into consideration the patient's good tolerance and the normal liver function, VPA was increased to 1500 mg/d. At this dose the daily drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures totally ceased. The patient presented only some tonic seizures around awakening. During many years, VPA was avoided in this patient because of its potential hepatotoxicity. However the good functioning of the transplanted liver permitted its introduction. VPA can be used safely in liver transplanted patients under the strict control of the hepatic function.

"	"Cases of severe childhood epilepsies in temporal association with vaccination have great impact on the acceptance of vaccination programs by parents and health care providers. However, little is known about the type and frequency of seizures and epilepsy syndromes following vaccination. This study aims to describe the clinical features of children presenting with seizures after vaccination using a register-based cohort. We surveyed the national German database of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for reported seizures and epilepsies in children aged 0-6 years. All cases reported in 2006-2008 were analyzed retrospectively; available clinical information was reevaluated and classified by seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. In total, 328 cases reported between 2006 and 2008 were included. Data supportive of seizures or epilepsy were present in 247 (75.3%) of 328 patients with a mean interval between the vaccination and the epileptic event of 24 h and 7.5 days for inactivated and attenuated vaccines, respectively. Fifty-one (15.5%) of 328 patients presented with syncope, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, or other nonepileptic events. Information was insufficient for classification into epileptic versus nonepileptic events in 30 (11.3%) of 328 patients. For cases with confirmed seizures, febrile seizures were present in 121 (49%) of 247 cases, and 38 (15.4%) of 247 patients had single afebrile seizures. Status epilepticus was described in 21 (8.5%) of 247 patients. Thirty-one (12.6%) of 247 patients presented with various pediatric epilepsy syndromes. Severe childhood epilepsies (Dravet syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or Doose syndrome) were diagnosed in 29 (11.7%) of 247 patients, with the vaccination-associated event being the first documented seizure in 15 (51.7%) of 29 patients. Vaccination-associated seizures present in the setting of various epilepsy syndromes, including severe childhood epilepsies in >10% of cases. Early diagnosis of the corresponding epilepsy syndromes and confirmation of an underlying etiology is important for treatment decisions, genetic counseling, and public health evaluation of vaccine safety.

21790560	"Definition and natural history of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy with a peak age of onset of 3-5 years of age. Reported prevalence rates for LGS vary widely from 1-10% of all childhood epilepsies. Incidence rates are much lower. LGS is characterized by intractable, multiple, generalized seizure types and an interictal electroencephalogram showing bursts of slow spike-and-wave, paroxysmal bursts of generalized polyspikes, and a slow background. All patients have tonic seizures during sleep that may be subtle, and nearly all have treatment-resistant, lifelong epilepsy. Cognitive stagnation and behavioral problems are seen in almost all patients and lead to a life of dependency. The differential diagnosis includes other symptomatic generalized epilepsies and pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Misdiagnosis is common. Children and adults with LGS have an enormous impact on their families, and efforts to improve the quality of life for these patients are complex.

"	"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for the treatment of refractory partial epileptic seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients older than 12 years was approved in Europe in 1994 and in the United States in 1997. We have studied the efficacy of VNS in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy hospitalized in the Neurology Department of the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. From 1997 to 2001 we have implanted VNS in 11 patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, who were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) negative and from May 2007 to May 2009 in 11 patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, 9 of them were MRI positive, and were inoperable due to localisation of the pathomorphologic changes (ganglioglioma, hamartoma, various types of cortical dysplasia, porencephalic cysts), 2 were MR negative. In the group of MRI negative patients 1 patient had complex partial seizures (CPS), 6 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation, 2 patients had primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) including myoclonic, absence, atonic and tonic-clonic seizures, one patient had PGE and CPS, and 3 patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). In the group of MRI positive patients one patient had elementary partial seizures (EPS) and CPS, two patients had EPS and CPS with secondary generalisation, one patient had CPS, 3 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation, and 2 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation as well as atonic seizures. After continuous follow-up of 11 MRI negative patients during 5 years and 2 MRI negative patients during one year there was decrease in mean-seizure frequency of 51.67%. After continuous follow-up of 9 MRI positive patients during 2 years there was decrease in mean-seizure frequency of 61.9%. The most frequent side effects were hoarseness, throat pain and cough in the ""on phase"" of the VNS, but they were mild and transitory. We can conclude that VNS was effective mode of therapy in our group of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.

"	"We aimed to clarify the relationships between post-sectional recruitment of epileptiform discharges (PRED) seen in electrocorticograms (ECoG) during callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and postoperative seizure outcome. We retrospectively analyzed ECoG obtained during subtotal callosotomy (6 cm) in 48 patients with LGS (32 males, 16 females; age range, 1-20 years; mean age, 7.6 years) from July 1993 to November 1996 and compared recorded findings with postoperative seizure outcome. At analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 10 years. Of 48 patients, 15 (31.3%) had PRED in their post-section ECoG. Of these patients, 11 (73%) achieved significant (at least 50%) overall seizure reduction postoperatively. The phenomenon of PRED in callosotomy did not predict a better postoperative seizure outcome (p>0.05). We concluded that post-sectional ECoG recruitment of electrical discharges during callosotomy did not predict postoperative prognosis. However, this finding should be supported and elucidated by further studies. The heterogenous ECoG findings during callosotomy in our series might suggest a complicated role of the corpus callosum in the epileptogenesis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Atypical absence seizures are drug resistant in the majority of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and herald a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we studied the effects of environmental enrichment, enriched housing conditions designed to stimulate sensory and motor systems in the brain, on behavioral outcome in mice treated with the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor AY-9944 (AY), a clinically relevant model of atypical absence epilepsy. Beginning at postnatal day (P) 2, C3H mice were treated with AY (7.5 mg/kg) every 6 days until P20 and then weaned into enriched or standard cages. After 30 days (∼P50), AY mice from the enriched housing condition exhibited less behavioral hyperactivity and anxiety, improved olfactory recognition, and spatial learning, but no significant reduction in the number of ictal discharges in comparison with their non-enriched cohorts. The beneficial effects of environmental enrichment in AY model were in some behavioral tests gender-specific in favor of males suggesting that other, possibly hormonally mediated mechanisms, may interact with the therapeutic effects of enrichment. Taken together, these data provide a starting point to derive clinical occupational therapies for improving behavioral outcome in cases of intractable childhood seizures.

A 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG, with a 600Hz sampling rate, was used to examine PFA in 3 children with ESs. We analyzed MEG recordings of PFA by short-time Fourier transform and the aberrant area or high-power spectrum was superimposed onto reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance images as moving images. One ictal discharge was collected. One child and one adult with PFA due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were also examined for comparison. All four PFAs in Patient 1 and five PFAs in Patient 3 were generated from one hemisphere. In Patient 2, four of seven PFAs were generated from one hemisphere and the remaining three were generated from both hemispheres. In Patient 3, one ictal MEG showed ictal discharges that were generated from the same area as the PFA, although the electroencephalogram showed no discharge. In Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, all 10 PFAs were generated from bilateral hemispheres simultaneously. Short-time Fourier transform analyses of MEG PFA can show the origin and form of propagation of PFA. These results suggest that ESs are representative of focal seizures and the mechanism of PFA is different between ESs and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing we identified an ST3GAL3 mutation in three infants with West syndrome. ST3GAL3 encodes a sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of sialyl-Lewis epitopes on cell surface-expressed glycoproteins. The mutation affected an essential sialyl-motif and abolished enzymatic activity. Abnormalities in proteins involved in forebrain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic growth and function were recently proposed to account for infantile spasms. Dysfunctional ST3GAL3 may thus result in perturbation of the posttranslational sialylation of proteins in these pathways.

Here, we describe autosomal recessive mutations in KPNA7 found by whole exome sequencing in a sibling pair with severe developmental disability, infantile spasms, subsequent intractable epilepsy consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The mutations mapped to exon 7 in KPNA7 result in two amino-acid substitutions, Pro339Ala and Glu344Gln. On the basis of the crystal structure of the paralog KPNA2 bound to a bipartite nuclear localization signal from the retinoblastoma protein, the amino-acid substitutions in the affected subjects were predicted to occur within the seventh armadillo repeat that forms one of the two nuclear localization signal-binding sites in KPNA family members. Glu344 is conserved in all seven KPNA proteins, and we found that the Glu354Gln mutation in KPNA2 is sufficient to reduce binding to the retinoblastoma nuclear localization signal to approximately one-half that of wild-type protein. Our data show that compound heterozygous mutations in KPNA7 are associated with a human neurodevelopmental disease, and provide the first example of a human disease associated with mutation of a nuclear transport receptor.

"	"Verapamil, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, has been occasionally reported to have some effect on reducing seizure frequency in drug-resistant epilepsy or status epilepticus. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of verapamil as add-on treatment in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Seven children with drug-resistant structural-metabolic, unknown or genetic (e.g., Dravet syndrome [DS]) epilepsy received verapamil as an add-on drug to baseline antiepileptic therapy. Verapamil was slowly introduced at the dosage of 1mg/kg/day and titrated up to 1.5mg/kg/day. After completing the titration period, patients entered a 14-month maintenance period and were followed up at 3, 8, and 14 months. Heart monitoring was performed at baseline and at each follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the response of seizures to verapamil. Three subjects with genetically determined DS showed a partial (reduction of 50-99%) response for all types of seizures. A patient with DS without known mutation showed a partial control of all types of seizures in the first 13 months; then seizures worsened and verapamil was suspended. Two patients with structural epilepsy and one with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome showed no improvement. Any side effects were recorded. Add-on treatment with verapamil seems to have some effect in controlling seizures in patients with genetically determined DS. Our observations justify further research on the relationship between calcium channels, calcium channel blockers, and channelopathies.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome. The cause is unknown in 25% of cases. Little has been described about the specific clinical or electroencephalography (EEG) features of LGS of unknown or genetic cause (LGS(u)). The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) aims to characterize LGS(u) by phenotypic analysis of patients with LGS(u) and their parents. One hundred thirty-five patients with LGS with no known etiology and their parents were enrolled from 19 EPGP centers in the United States and Australia. Clinical data from medical records, standardized questionnaires, imaging, and EEG were collected with use of online informatics systems developed for EPGP. LGS(u) in the EPGP cohort had a broad range of onset of epilepsy from 1 to 13 years, was male predominant (p < 0.0002), and was associated with normal development prior to seizure onset in 59.2% of patients. Despite the diagnosis, almost half of the adult patients with LGS(u) completed secondary school. Parents were cognitively normal. All subjects had EEG recordings with generalized epileptiform abnormalities with a spike wave frequency range of 1-5 Hz (median 2 Hz), whereas 8.1% of subjects had EEG studies with a normal posterior dominant rhythm. Almost 12% of patients evolved from West syndrome. LGS(u) has distinctive characteristics including a broad age range of onset, male predominance, and often normal development prior to the onset of seizures. Cognitive achievements such as completion of secondary school were possible in half of adult patients. Our phenotypic description of LGS(u) coupled with future genetic studies will advance our understanding of this epilepsy syndrome.

"	"Clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZD), was FDA-approved in October 2011 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years and older. BZDs exert various CNS effects through allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. The structurally distinct, 1,4-BZD clonazepam (CLN) is also approved to treat LGS. The precise mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of both are unknown. Data show that the GABAA α₁-subunit-selective compound zolpidem [ZOL] exhibits hypnotic/sedative effects. Conversely, data from knock-in mice carrying BZD binding site mutations suggest that the α₂ subunit mediates anticonvulsant effects, without sedative actions. Hence, the specific pattern of interactions across the GABAA receptor complexes of BZDs might be reflected in their clinical efficacies and adverse effect profiles. In this study, GABAA-receptor binding affinities of CLB, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB, the major metabolite of CLB), CLN, and ZOL were characterized with native receptors from rat-brain homogenates and on cloned receptors from HEK293 cells transfected with combinations of α (α₁, α₂, α₃, or α₅), β₂, and γ₂ subtypes. Our results demonstrate that CLB and N-CLB have significantly greater binding affinities for α₂- vs. α₁-receptor complexes, a difference not observed for CLN, for which no distinction between α₂ and α₁ receptors was observed. Our experiments with ZOL confirmed the high preference for α₁ receptors. These results provide potential clues to a new understanding of the pharmacologic modes of action of CLB and N-CLB.

"	"In October 2011, clobazam was FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a debilitating childhood epilepsy characterized by drop attacks, for patients 2 years and older. To assess the budget impact of adding clobazam to an antiepileptic drug (AED) portfolio containing topiramate, lamotrigine, and rufinamide in a hypothetical, 100,000-member commercially insured health plan. Patient characteristics and AED efficacy (decrease in drop-seizure frequency) were modeled with clinical data. Medical costs were derived from administrative claims data from a large U.S. managed health plan, with the assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures required medical care. Two-year budget impact was measured. Results were expressed as the overall difference in costs (medical and pharmacy) to a health plan and cost per member per month (PMPM) after addition of clobazam. Analyses of alternative scenarios were performed. With the assumption that 0.04% of the plan population had LGS, adding clobazam to the formulary resulted in cost savings of $98,059 in year 1 and $131,690 in year 2 (savings of $0.08 and $0.11 PMPM, respectively). Analyses of alternative scenarios with lower seizure rates upon discontinuation or greater long-term efficacy for lamotrigine and topiramate did not substantially alter conclusions. The assumption that fewer drop seizures required medical care resulted in a savings of approximately $5,000 per year with clobazam, which suggested that medically attended drop seizures drive costs. Medically attended drop seizures are a major cost driver for LGS patients. Adding clobazam to a health plan formulary can have a positive overall budget impact through decreased medical costs associated with drop seizures.

"	"Generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) consists of burst of generalized rhythmic discharges; 100-200 μV; 1-9s; 8-26 Hz; with frontal predominance; appearing during NREM sleep. GPFA was originally described as an electrographic feature of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). We analyzed GPFA on scalp video EEG (VEEG) in children to evaluate that GPFA presents in patients with intractable localization-related epilepsy. We collected cases with GPFA with intractable localization-related epilepsy who underwent scalp VEEG, MRI, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) prior to intracranial video EEG (IVEEG) and surgical resection. We collected 50 epochs of GPFA per patient during the first night during scalp VEEG. We analyzed amplitude, duration and frequency of GPFA over the bilateral frontal region between surgical resection side with grid placement and non-resection side. We identified 14 (14%) patients with GPFA on scalp VEEG. The mean amplitude ranged from 145 to 589 μV (mean 293 μV). The mean duration ranged from 1.18 to 2.31s (mean 1.6s). The mean frequencies ranged from 9.3 to 14.7 Hz (mean 11.1 Hz). The amplitude (307 ± 156 μV) and duration (1.62 ± 0.8s) of GPFAs in all the patients over the resection side were significantly higher than those (279 ± 141 μV, 1.58 ± 0.8s) of the non-resection side (p<0.001). All nine patients who showed significant duration differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had longer duration of GPFA over the resection side. Eight of 12 patients who showed significant amplitude differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher amplitude of GPFA over the resection side. Four of six patients who showed significant frequency differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher frequency of GPFA over the resection side. Nine (64%) patients became seizure free after surgical resection including multilobar resections in eight patients. GPFA can exist in localization-related epilepsy with secondary bilateral synchrony. Although EEG shows GPFA on scalp VEEG, the precise localization of the epileptogenic zone using IVEEG could achieve the successful surgical resection.

"	"Studies on the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in infants and young children are scarce. Here we report on an open, retrospective, and pragmatic study about safety and efficacy of rufinamide in children aged less than four years, in terms of seizures types and epilepsy syndromes. Forty children (mean age 39.5 months; range 22-48) were enrolled in the study. The mean follow-up period was 12.2 months (range 5-21). Rufinamide was initiated at a mean age of 26.7 months (range 12-42). Final rufinamide mean dosage was 31.5 mg/kg/day if associated with valproic acid and 44.2 mg/kg/day if not. The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the epileptic spasms (46%) and drop attacks (42%) groups. Seizure reduction was also observed in tonic seizures (35%) and in the focal seizure (30%) groups. In terms of epilepsy syndrome, rufinamide was effective in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Results were very poor for those affected by Dravet's syndrome. Globally, responder rate was 27.5%, including two (5%) patients seizure-free. Adverse reactions occurred in 37.5% of children and were mainly represented by vomiting, drowsiness, irritability, and anorexia. Discontinuation rate due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 15%. The present study concludes that rufinamide may be a safe and effective drug for a broad range of seizures and epilepsy syndromes in infants and young children and represents a valid therapeutic option in this population.

"	"To assess withdrawal-related adverse event (AE) rates following abrupt clobazam discontinuation in Phase I trials and gradual clobazam tapering (2-3 weeks) following discontinuation from III trials met the criteria for potential/III trials, we evaluated AE data from four multiple-dosage Phase I trials (duration: 8-34 days). Therapeutic (20 and 40 mg/day) and supratherapeutic clobazam dosages (120 and 160 mg/day) were administered. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome enrolled in Phase II (OV-1002) and Phase III (OV-1012) studies (duration ≤15 weeks) and in the open-label extension (OLE) trial OV-1004 (≤5 years). Potential withdrawal-related AEs were identified by preferred terms, provided that the AEs occurred ≥1 day following and ≤30 days after the last clobazam doses, or were deemed withdrawal symptoms by investigators. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) scale was used to evaluate withdrawal intensity in three of the four Phase I trials. A total of 207 participants in Phase I trials received steady-state clobazam dosages of 20-160 mg/day, 182 received clobazam dosages of ≥40 mg/day, and 94 received clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Abrupt clobazam discontinuation led to 193 withdrawal-related AEs for 68 Phase I participants. Nearly 50% of AEs occurred after discontinuation of clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate and included headache (14% of Phase I participants), insomnia (12.6%), tremor (10.1%), and anxiety (8.7%). The CIWA-B scores varied (range: 0-59). Most scores were <30, indicating possible mild benzodiazepine withdrawal. III trials met the criteria for potential/III patients received clobazam dosages of ≤40 mg/day, and those in the OLE trial received clobazam dosages of ≤80 mg/day. Eighty-seven patients discontinued clobazam and were gradually tapered. No withdrawal-related AEs or incidences of status epilepticus were reported. Withdrawal-related AEs observed in Phase I studies following abrupt clobazam discontinuation at therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosages were generally mild. No withdrawal-related AEs occurred when dosages were tapered over 3 weeks, after short- or long-term clobazam use (≤5 years).

"	"Epilepsy is a complex disease necessitating continuous development of new therapeutic strategies to encounter drug-resistant cases. Among new adjuvant antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide is structurally distinct from other antiepileptic drugs. It is used to treat partial-onset seizures and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in adult and children. To date, there has been no attempt to evaluate systematically the risks of adverse events with rufinamide. We performed a quantitative risk analysis of central nervous system (CNS) adverse events of rufinamide from all randomized, double-blind, add-on, placebo-controlled trials. The meta-analysis was undertaken with fixed effects models. Of the 886 publications reviewed, 99 papers were retrieved and five articles met the inclusion criteria. One thousand two hundred and fifty-two patients were included. Our study showed that exposure to rufinamide was associated with a significant increase in risk of somnolence [relative ratio (RR) 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33, 2.62; P = 0.0003], dizziness (RR 2.66; 95% CI 2.00, 3.55; P = 0.00001), fatigue (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.57, 2.91; P = 0.01) and headache (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.02, 1.59, P = 0.03). In addition, exposure to rufinamide was associated with higher treatment discontinuation rates as compared with placebo (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.74, 4.03; P = 0.00001). The risk of CNS adverse events appears to be increased in patients exposed to rufinamide as well as the treatment discontinuation rates. However, although statistical associations were significant, additional long term safety studies are required to confirm the clinical significance of these findings, as most reports described only mild and moderate adverse events.

"	"To gain insight into the long-term impact of vagus nerve stimulation (with VNS Therapy) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, we conducted the largest retrospective multicenter study to date over an extended follow-up period of up to 24 months. The primary objective was to assess change in seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type (defined as the most disabling seizure) following VNS device implantation. Treating physicians collected data from patient records from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. The analysis population included 347 children (aged 6 months to 17.9 years at the time of implant). At 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation, 32.5%, 37.6%, and 43.8%, respectively, of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in baseline seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type. The responder rate was higher in a subgroup of patients who had no change in antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during the study. Favorable results were also evident for all secondary outcome measures including changes in seizure duration, ictal severity, postictal severity, quality of life, clinical global impression of improvement, and safety. Post hoc analyses demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between VNS total charge delivered per day and an increase in response rate. VNS Therapy is indicated as adjunctive therapy in children with focal, structural epilepsies, who for any reason are not good candidates for surgical treatment following the trial of two or more AEDs. Children with predominantly generalized seizures from genetic, structural epilepsies, like Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, could also benefit from VNS Therapy. The results demonstrate that adjunctive VNS Therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy reduces seizure frequency and is well tolerated over a 2-year follow-up period. No new safety issues were identified. A post hoc analysis revealed a dose-response correlation for VNS in patients with epilepsy.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) has a major impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of the affected children as well as their caregivers. The primary caregiver in the family is generally the mother, with support from the father and siblings. The burden of care and the effects of the disease on the child necessitate adjustments in virtually all aspects of the lives of their family. These adjustments inevitably affect the physical, emotional, social, and financial health of the whole family. Numerous sources of support for families can help to ease the burden of care. Improvements in the treatment of LGS, in addition to helping the child with LGS, would likely help improve the HRQL of the family members. This pilot parent survey was designed to explore the impact of epilepsy on caregiver HRQL. Parents of children with epilepsy who had contacted the Epilepsy Information Service at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, were sent questionnaires comprising open- and closed-ended questions. A total of 200 surveys were distributed, with a return rate of 48%. The results revealed that 74% of the parents believed that having a child with epilepsy brought them and their partner closer together. However, when the parents were asked to explain the manner in which epilepsy affected their families, answers included continuous stress, major financial distress, and lack of time to spend with other children. Information and resources for the families of children with LGS could help improve the HRQL of both the patients and their relatives.

"	"The 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older in the United States, and for treatment of anxiety and various forms of epilepsy elsewhere. Clobazam has been reported to exhibit different in vivo adverse effects and addiction liability profile than the classic 1,4-benzodiazepines. In this study, it was investigated whether the in vitro pharmacological properties of clobazam and its major active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam could explain some of these clinical differences. The functional properties of the two 1,5-benzodiazepines were characterized at the human γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S), α5β2γ(2S) and α6β2δ expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by use of two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology and compared to those exhibited by the 1,4-benzodiazepine clonazepam. All three compounds potentiated GABA EC20-evoked responses through the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, with each displaying similar EC50 values at the four subtypes. Furthermore, the degrees of potentiation of the GABA EC20 currents through the four receptors mediated by saturating modulator concentrations did not differ substantially for any of the three benzodiazepines. The three compounds were substantially less potent (200-3900 fold) as positive allosteric modulators at the α6β2δ GABA(A)R than at the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) receptors. Interestingly, however, clobazam and especially N-desmethylclobazam were highly efficacious potentiators of α6β2δ receptor signaling. Although this activity component is unlikely to contribute to the in vivo effects of clobazam/N-desmethylclobazam, the 1,5-benzodiazepine could constitute an interesting lead for novel modulators targeting this low-affinity binding site in GABAARs. In conclusion, the non-selective modulation exerted by clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam and clonazepam at the α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S) and α5β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs indicate that the observed clinical differences between clobazam and 1,4-benzodiazepines are likely to arise from factors other than their respective pharmacological properties at the GABA(A)Rs as investigated here.

Recently, mutations in DNM1 (dynamin 1) have been implicated in two EE syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Dnm1 encodes dynamin 1, a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Dnm1Ftfl or ""fitful"" mice carry a spontaneous mutation in the mouse ortholog of DNM1 and recapitulate many of the disease features associated with human DNM1 patients, providing a relevant disease model of human EE's. In order to examine the cellular etiology of seizures and behavioral and neurological comorbidities, we engineered a conditional Dnm1Ftfl mouse model of DNM1 EE. Observations of Dnm1Ftfl/flox mice in combination with various neuronal subpopulation specific cre strains demonstrate unique seizure phenotypes and clear separation of major neurobehavioral comorbidities from severe seizures associated with the germline model. This demonstration of pleiotropy suggests that treating seizures per se may not prevent severe comorbidity observed in EE associated with dynamin-1 mutations, and is likely to have implications for other genetic forms of EE.

At therapeutic clobazam dosages, N-CLB plasma concentrations are 3-5 times greater than the parent compound. PK data from clinical trials in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS; OV-1002 and OV-1012), healthy participants (OV-1016), and participants with and without renal impairment (OV-1032), as well as those from a publication describing the effects of hepatic impairment on clobazam PK, were merged to create the PPK model. Individual patient clobazam PK parameters from the publication were used to generate patient plasma-concentration data. Clobazam PK was linear and the formation of N-CLB was elimination-rate limited. Hepatic impairment did not affect the total apparent clearance of clobazam but may affect the PK of N-CLB. Because the formation of N-CLB is elimination-rate limited and the total apparent clearance of clobazam is unaffected by hepatic impairment, the PPK model suggests that patients with LGS and hepatic impairment may not require clobazam dosage modification.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and the similar but less tightly defined Lennox-Gastaut phenotype, describe patients with severe epilepsy, generalized epileptic discharges, and variable intellectual disability. Our previous functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal diffuse association network activity underlies the epileptic discharges of this clinical phenotype. Herein we use a data-driven multivariate approach to determine the spatial changes in local and global networks of patients with severe epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut phenotype. We studied 9 adult patients and 14 controls. In 20 min of task-free blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data, two metrics of functional connectivity were studied: Regional homogeneity or local connectivity, a measure of concordance between each voxel to a focal cluster of adjacent voxels; and eigenvector centrality, a global connectivity estimate designed to detect important neural hubs. Multivariate pattern analysis of these data in a machine-learning framework was used to identify spatial features that classified disease subjects. Multivariate pattern analysis was 95.7% accurate in classifying subjects for both local and global connectivity measures (22/23 subjects correctly classified). Maximal discriminating features were the following: increased local connectivity in frontoinsular and intraparietal areas; increased global connectivity in posterior association areas; decreased local connectivity in sensory (visual and auditory) and medial frontal cortices; and decreased global connectivity in the cingulate cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and pons. Using a data-driven analysis method in task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show increased connectivity in critical areas of association cortex and decreased connectivity in primary cortex. This supports previous findings of a critical role for these association cortical regions as a final common pathway in generating the Lennox-Gastaut phenotype. Abnormal function of these areas is likely to be important in explaining the intellectual problems characteristic of this disorder.

26744634	"Simultaneous Electroencephalography and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the Identification of Epileptic Networks in Children
"	"EEG/fMRI takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of EEG in combination with the high spatial resolution of fMRI. These features make it particularly applicable to the study of epilepsy in which the event duration (e.g., interictal epileptiform discharges) is short, typically less than 200 milliseconds. Interictal or ictal discharges can be identified on EEG and be used for source localization in fMRI analyses. The acquisition of simultaneous EEG/fMRI involves the use of specialized EEG hardware that is safe in the MR environment and comfortable to the participant. Advanced data analysis approaches such as independent component analysis conducted alone or sometimes combined with other, e.g., Granger Causality or ""sliding window"" analyses are currently thought to be most appropriate for EEG/fMRI data. These approaches make it possible to identify networks of brain regions associated with ictal and/or interictal events allowing examination of the mechanisms critical for generation and propagation through these networks. After initial evaluation in adults, EEG/fMRI has been applied to the examination of the pediatric epilepsy syndromes including Childhood Absence Epilepsy, Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), Dravet Syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Results of EEG/fMRI studies suggest that the hemodynamic response measured by fMRI may have a different shape in response to epileptic events compared to the response to external stimuli; this may be especially true in the developing brain. Thus, the main goal of this review is to provide an overview of the pediatric applications of EEG/fMRI and its associated findings up until this point.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epilepsy of childhood onset associated with intellectual disability and multiple seizure types. Characteristic interictal electrographic discharges include generalized paroxysmal fast activity and slow spike and wave, which we have previously shown recruit widespread areas of association cortex. We wished to determine whether patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have changes in cerebral volumes that match this pattern of cortical recruitment. High resolution T1 weighted structural MRI was collected from 10 patients with LGS and 10 age and sex matched controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to compare tissue volumes across the whole brain (grey matter, white matter and CSF) and pontine volume between patients and controls, as well as to identify other regions of maximal tissue loss. LGS patients showed a significant decrease in whole brain volume compared to controls. Cortical atrophy was prominent in the mesial frontal region and bilateral anterior temporal poles. White matter atrophy was widespread and included peri-central and premotor regions. Atrophy was prominent in the pons, particularly in the region of the reticular formation. Grey matter atrophy trended to progress with age. Grey and white matter atrophy are a feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Grey matter atrophy is apparent in the mesial frontal lobe suggesting this region may be an important node in the epilepsy network of LGS. Atrophy maximal in the pons and cerebellum mimics the patterns of seizure spread that has been previously observed during tonic seizures. This supports the idea that the pons is a key part of the epilepsy network in LGS.

"	"To explore the long-term effectiveness of rufinamide in managing Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), other epileptic encephalopathies, and intractable focal epilepsies in adults and children in routine clinical practice. A multicentre, retrospective chart review of patients prescribed adjunctive rufinamide at seven Spanish epilepsy centres, with assessments at six and 12 months. We evaluated data from 58 patients (40 male, age range 7-57 years), 25 of whom were diagnosed with LGS, 12 with other epileptic encephalopathies and 21 of whom were diagnosed with focal epilepsies, mainly frontal lobe. The mean daily rufinamide dose was 32.0 mg/kg (range 12.5-66.7 mg/kg) in children and 24.7 mg/kg (range 5.0-47.0 mg/kg) in adults, and the most commonly used concomitant antiepileptic drugs were levetiracetam and valproate. Rufinamide was discontinued in 25 patients (43.1%) during the 1-year follow-up, and the most common reason was lack of effectiveness (n = 12, 20.7% of total). The frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was significantly reduced from baseline at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001), both in patients with generalized epilepsies and in patients with focal epilepsies. Significant seizure frequency reduction from baseline was observed at 12 months (P = 0.01) for tonic/atonic seizures and at 6 months (P = 0.001) for focal seizures. Side effects were reported in 21 patients (36.2%): nausea, vomiting and weight loss were most frequent. Rufinamide was well tolerated and was effective in reducing frequency of generalized tonic-clonic, tonic/atonic and focal seizures in both children and adults with severe refractory epilepsies, primarily LGS.

"	"To present a modified technique and early outcomes of a continent catheterizable vesicostomy in pediatric patients with either flaccid neurogenic bladder or intractable voiding dysfunction and large capacity bladder. Six patients underwent the procedure from October 2014 to December 2015. A 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made, avoiding intraperitoneal dissection. After adequate mobilization, a 2-cm vertical flap at the dome of the bladder was identified and tubularized over a 12Fr catheter with 4-0 vicryl suture. The tubularized flap was then intussuscepted into the bladder with four 4-0 polydioxanone sutures, creating a continent mechanism. The catheterizable channel was then tunneled to the umbilicus, the channel ostomy matured, and the cystotomy closed in two layers. The median patient age was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 12) years. All patients had urinary dysfunction requiring drainage from etiologies that included Eagle-Barrett syndrome (n = 2), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 1), and Spina bifida (n = 2). Median hospital length of stay was 8 (IQR 3) days. One patient had a superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics, and 1 patient required balloon dilation of the catheterizable channel at 3 months postoperatively, secondary to difficulty self-catheterizing. Five patients were successfully self-catheterizing at last follow-up. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR 5) months and there were no intra- or perioperative complications. Continent catheterizable vesicostomy is a novel technique for urinary drainage in patients with large bladder capacity that spares use of the appendix or ileum. Early results are encouraging, providing a catheterizable channel through the umbilicus without urinary leakage between catheterization.

This epilepsy syndrome resulted form a porencephalic cyst secondary to brain abscesses that occurred during the management of malnutrition due to untreated tyrosinemia type 1. We used a ketogenic diet as treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome taking into account dietary requirements for tyrosinemia type 1. The patient was transiently responder during a 6-month period. This report illustrates that ketogenic diet remains a therapeutic option even when additional dietary requirements are needed.

In the first subgroup of 30 patients, ES started at a mean age of 10.6 months (range, 2-40 months). Ictal EEG recordings showed diffuse high-amplitude slow waves in 15 patients, diffuse slow waves followed by voltage attenuation in six patients, diffuse fast rhythms in five, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in three, and diffuse sharp waves in one. In the second subgroup of 18 patients, nine had electroclinical features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, four had epilepsy with myoclonic and atonic seizures, two had Dravet syndrome, one 6-year-old boy had a non-convulsive status epilepticus characterized by atypical absences associated with ES, one had epilepsy with migrating seizures of infancy, and one patient had clinical features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis with ES. ES started at a mean age of 6.3 years (range, 0.5-13 years). The ictal EEG recording during the ES showed diffuse fast rhythms in 10 cases, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in four, and diffuse slow waves in four. Our study shows two subgroups of children with ESWoH. The first subgroup had a well-defined electroclinical syndrome predominantly in infancy, and in the second subgroup ES was one more seizure type associated with an epileptic encephalopathy other than West syndrome predominantly occurring in childhood.

We retrospectively reviewed all the long-term video-EEG reports from Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center over a 12-year period (2004-2015) for the occurrence of the terms ""cry"" or ""sob"" or ""weep"" in the text body. All the extracted reports were reviewed, and patients with at least one episode of documented ictal crying at the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) were included in the study. During the study period, 5133 patients were investigated at our EMU. Thirty-two patients (0.6%) had at least one documented seizure accompanied by crying. Twenty-seven patients (26 women and one man) had psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), and five patients (0.1%) had epilepsy. Among patients with epileptic ictal crying, four patients had focal epilepsy (two had definite, and two had probable frontal lobe epilepsy), while one patient had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Ictal crying is a rare finding among patients evaluated at the EMUs. The most common underlying etiology for ictal crying is PNES. However, ictal crying is not a specific sign for PNES. Epileptic ictal crying is often a rare type of partial seizure in patients with focal epilepsy. Dacrystic seizures do not provide clinical value in predicting localization of the epileptogenic zone.

"	"The categorisation of the childhood epilepsies into a number of different syndromes has allowed greater insight into the prognosis, not only with regard to seizure control but also in relation to cognitive and behavioural outcome. The role of genetics in determining both the syndrome and the behavioural outcome remains promising, although the promise is still largely unfulfilled. The behavioural/psychiatric outcome of a selection of the large number of childhood epilepsy syndromes is presented. The rate of autism in West syndrome, particularly in children who have tuberous sclerosis with temporal tubers, is high. In Dravet syndrome there is a loss of skills, with an associated increase in behavioural problems. The frequency of both subtle and overt seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome almost certainly accounts for the apparent poor motivation; however, a marked improvement in seizure control with treatment can also result in behavioural problems, probably as a result of the ""release phenomenon"". A number of cognitive problems can arise in the so-called ""benign"" syndrome of epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and the rate of ADHD is high. Autistic features and ADHD have been described in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and other syndromes associated with electrical status epilepticus of slow-wave sleep (ESES). Early effective treatment may reverse some of these features. There is clear evidence for a behavioural syndrome in relation to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), in which both clinical descriptions and functional neuroimaging indicate frontal lobe deficits.

Our previous study of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children with focal epilepsy showed significant reduction in epileptiform discharges. We hypothesized that cathodal tDCS when applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) combined with pharmacologic treatment will be more effective for reducing seizure frequency in patients with LGS than pharmacologic treatment alone. Study participants were randomized to receive either (1) pharmacologic treatment with five consecutive days of 2 mA cathodal tDCS over M1 for 20 min or (2) pharmacologic treatment plus sham tDCS. Measures of seizure frequency and epileptic discharges were performed before treatment and again immediately post-treatment and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week follow-up. Twenty-two patients with LGS were enrolled. Participants assigned to the active tDCS condition reported significantly more pre- to post-treatment reductions in seizure frequency and epileptic discharges that were sustained for 3 weeks after treatment. Five consecutive days of cathodal tDCS over M1 combined with pharmacologic treatment appears to reduce seizure frequency and epileptic discharges. Further studies of the potential mechanisms of tDCS in the LGS are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02731300 (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov).

"	"Doose and Lennox-Gastaut (syndromes) are rare generalized electroclinical affections of early infancy of variable prognosis which manifest with very diverse kinds of seizures. Very frequently, these types of epilepsy become drug resistant and finding reliable treatment results is very difficult. As a result of this, fighting against these syndromes becomes a long term (or endless) event for the little patient, the neurologist and the parents. A lot of Electroencephalographic (EEG) records are so accumulated during the child's life in order to monitor evolution and correlate it with medications. So, given a bunch of EEG, three questions arise: (a) On which year was the child healthier (less affected by seizures)? (b) Which area of the brain has been the most affected? (c) What is the status of the child with respect to others (which also have a bunch of EEG, each)? Answering these interrogations by traditional scrutinizing of the whole database becomes subjective, if not impossible. We propose to answer these questions objectively by means of time series entropies. We start with our modified version of the Multiscale Entropy (MSE) in order to generalize it as a Bivariate MSE (BMSE) and from them, we compute two indices. All were tested in a series of patients and coincide with medical conclusions. As far as we are concerned, our contribution is new.

We studied the significance of causal connectivity for identifying hidden epileptogenic areas in preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and for making a decision regarding resective surgery. We enrolled 18 LGS patients who underwent corpus callosotomy. Eight patients with unilateral epileptogenicity on post-callosotomy EEG underwent resective surgery (group A). Ten patients with independent bilateral epileptogenicity did not undergo resective surgery (group B). We analyzed generalized epileptiform discharges on pre-callosotomy EEG via direct directed transfer function (dDTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC). All regions exhibiting unilaterality in group A and bilaterality identified by dDTF or PDC in group B were concordant with the lateralization of the irritative zone on post-callosotomy EEG and with the localization of the resective areas, except for one patient in group A. The regions identified by dDTF exhibited high concordance rates with the resective areas in patients with good outcomes. Causal connectivity methods showed good concordance with hidden epileptogenic areas, and its concordance was associated with the prognosis of surgical outcome. This study provides evidence that causal connectivity methods can be helpful in deciding which type of surgery will be suitable for an LGS patient.

Individual patient listings were reviewed for dosage increases ≥40% and increasing seizure rates. Data from 200 patients were included. For patients free of drop seizures, there was no notable change in dosage over 24 months. For responder groups still exhibiting drop seizures, dosages were increased. Weekly drop-seizure rates for 100% and ≥75% responders demonstrated a consistent response over time. Few patients had a dosage increase ≥40% associated with an increase in seizure rates. Two-year findings suggest that the majority of patients do not develop tolerance to the antiseizure actions of clobazam. Observed dosage increases may reflect best efforts to achieve seizure freedom.

The aim of this study was to determine if the adjunctive use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with LGS and drug-resistant epilepsy is efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency and also to investigate its safety and tolerability. Methods: This was an open-label pilot study with convenience sampling from one center. Bitemporal electrode placement was selected. ECT was administered three times per week for four weeks (considered as the induction phase), and then once a week for two months (considered as the maintenance phase). Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2, 3, 4, and 6 months to determine the seizure types and counts and also to determine the safety and tolerability of adjunctive use of ECT in these patients. All patients and / or their caregivers consented in writing to their participation. Results: Seven patients were studied. Just one patient experienced more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. One patient experienced more than 50% seizure increase with ECT. In three patients, there was an increase in aggressive behavior after receiving ECT. Two patients experienced mild and transient ataxia with ECT. One patient experienced mutism with ECT, which was transient and resolved with the termination of the procedure. Conclusion: In this small study, adjunctive use of an intensive ECT program in patients with LGS was not efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency. However, the safety profile was acceptable, and patients tolerated the adjunctive use of ECT very well. This finding can pave the road for future investigations.

Recently, de novo variants in BCL11A have been reported in individuals with intellectual disability syndrome without epilepsy. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 302 patients with epileptic encephalopathies (EEs), and identified 2 novel BCL11A variants, c.577delC (p.His193Metfs\*3) and c.2351A>C (p.Lys784Thr). Both the patients shared major physical features characteristic of BCL11A-related intellectual disability syndrome, suggesting that characteristic physical features and the persistence of HbF should lead clinicians to suspect EEs caused by BCL11A pathogenic variants. Patient 1, with a frameshift variant, presented with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which expands the phenotypic spectrum of BCL11A haploinsufficiency. Patient 2, with a p.Lys784Thr variant, presented with West syndrome followed by drug-resistant focal seizures and more severe developmental disability.

We reviewed phenotypic data of 21 patients (7 previously published) with DNM1 mutations. We compared mutation data to known functional data and undertook biomolecular modeling to assess the effect of the mutations on protein function. We identified 19 patients with de novo mutations in DNM1 and a sibling pair who had an inherited mutation from a mosaic parent. Seven patients (33.3%) carried the recurrent p.Arg237Trp mutation. A common phenotype emerged that included severe to profound intellectual disability and muscular hypotonia in all patients and an epilepsy characterized by infantile spasms in 16 of 21 patients, frequently evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Two patients had profound global developmental delay without seizures. In addition, we describe a single patient with normal development before the onset of a catastrophic epilepsy, consistent with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome at 4 years. All mutations cluster within the GTPase or middle domains, and structural modeling and existing functional data suggest a dominant-negative effect on DMN1 function. The phenotypic spectrum of DNM1-related encephalopathy is relatively homogeneous, in contrast to many other genetic epilepsies. Up to one-third of patients carry the recurrent p.Arg237Trp variant, which is now one of the most common recurrent variants in epileptic encephalopathies identified to date.

Diagnosis is based on a triad of symptoms: multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment, and slow spike-and-wave pattern on electroencephalography. In practice, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presentation is diverse, and there may be a delay between initial symptoms and emergence of the full triad of clinical features. Additionally, differential diagnosis is complicated by the resemblance of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to other forms of epilepsy and by the need for varied diagnostic techniques requiring specific clinical skills. Because diagnosis is complex and early intervention may lead to improved outcomes, clinicians should consider treatment when Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptoms are present, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis.

29098688	"Thalamocortical functional connectivity in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is abnormally enhanced in executive-control and default-mode networks
"	"To identify abnormal thalamocortical circuits in the severe epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that may explain the shared electroclinical phenotype and provide potential treatment targets. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of LGS (mean age = 28.5 years) and 26 healthy controls (mean age = 27.6 years) were compared using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The thalamus was parcellated according to functional connectivity with 10 cortical networks derived using group-level independent component analysis. For each cortical network, we assessed between-group differences in thalamic functional connectivity strength using nonparametric permutation-based tests. Anatomical locations were identified by quantifying spatial overlap with a histologically informed thalamic MRI atlas. In both groups, posterior thalamic regions showed functional connectivity with visual, auditory, and sensorimotor networks, whereas anterior, medial, and dorsal thalamic regions were connected with networks of distributed association cortex (including the default-mode, anterior-salience, and executive-control networks). Four cortical networks (left and right executive-control network; ventral and dorsal default-mode network) showed significantly enhanced thalamic functional connectivity strength in patients relative to controls. Abnormal connectivity was maximal in mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. Specific thalamocortical circuits are affected in LGS. Functional connectivity is abnormally enhanced between the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus and the default-mode and executive-control networks, thalamocortical circuits that normally support diverse cognitive processes. In contrast, thalamic regions connecting with primary and sensory cortical networks appear to be less affected. Our previous neuroimaging studies show that epileptic activity in LGS is expressed via the default-mode and executive-control networks. Results of the present study suggest that the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus may be candidate targets for modulating abnormal network behavior underlying LGS, potentially via emerging thalamic neurostimulation therapies.

"	"To characterize the electroclinical features of epilepsy associated with intellectual disability and pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) METHODS: we prospectively investigated 61 adult patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability or other neurodevelopmental disorders. We performed high resolution SNP-Array analysis in order to detect clinical relevant chromosomal microdeletions and microduplications. An ordinal logistic regression model was fitted with 34 demographic, clinical and EEG-related variables in order to identify the epilepsy phenotype of patients with pathogenic CNVs. chromosome microarray analysis identify non-polymorphic CNVs in 33 patients analyzed: 11 had an established pathogenic microdeletion/microduplication, 22 were carriers of CNVs of unknown clinical significance. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between pathogenic CNVs and 3 electroclinical variables considered, specifically atypical absence seizures (p<0.05), tonic seizures (p<0.05), epileptic spasms (p<0.01). high resolution SNP-Array analysis should be evaluated in adult patients with intellectual disability and epilepsy with peculiar electroclinical features, specifically atypical absence seizures, tonic seizures, and epileptic spasms, resembling a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome without a clear structural lesion.

"	"To define the electroclinical phenotype and long-term outcomes in a cohort of patients with inv dup (15) syndrome. The electroclinical data of 45 patients (25 males) affected by inv dup (15) and seizures were retrospectively analysed, and long-term follow-up of epilepsy was evaluated. Epilepsy onset was marked by generalized seizures in 53% of patients, epileptic spasms in 51%, focal seizures in 26%, atypical absences in 11% and epileptic falls in 9%. The epileptic syndromes defined were: generalized epilepsy (26.7%), focal epilepsy (22.3%), epileptic encephalopathy with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type (17.7%) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (33.3%). Drug-resistant epilepsy was detected in 55.5% of patients. There was a significant higher prevalence of seizure-free patients in those with seizure onset after the age of 5 years and with focal epilepsy, with respect to those with earlier epilepsy onset because most of these later developed an epileptic encephalopathy (69.2% vs 34.4%; P = .03), usually Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in type. In fact, among patients with early-onset epilepsy, those presenting with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type associated with classical hypsarrhythmia achieved seizure freedom (P < .001) compared to patients with spasms and other seizure types associated with modified hypsarrhythmia. Epilepsy in inv dup (15) leads to a more severe burden of disease. Frequently, these patients show drug resistance, in particular when epilepsy onset is before the age of five and features epileptic encephalopathy.

We aimed to evaluate information-seeking behavior of Internet users searching the Italian Wikipedia for articles related to epilepsy and its treatment. Using Pageviews Analysis, we assessed the total and mean monthly views of articles from the Italian Wikipedia devoted to epilepsy, epileptic syndromes, seizure type, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017. We compared the views of the article on epilepsy with those of articles focusing on Alzheimer's disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, syncope, and stroke and adjusted all results for crude disease prevalence. With the only exception of the article on multiple sclerosis, the adjusted views for the Italian Wikipedia article on epilepsy were higher than those for the other neurological disorders. The most viewed articles on seizure type were devoted to tonic-clonic seizure, typical absence seizure, tonic convulsive seizures, and clonic convulsive seizures. The most frequently accessed articles on epilepsy syndromes were about temporal lobe epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The most frequently viewed articles on AEDs were devoted to valproic acid, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam. Wikipedia searches seem to mirror patients' fears and worries about epilepsy more than its actual epidemiology. The ultimate reasons for searching online remain unknown. Epileptologists and epilepsy scientific societies should make greater efforts to work jointly with Wikipedia to convey more accurate and up-to-date information about epilepsy.

"	"Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) involves infantile-onset acute hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus with subsequent unilateral cerebral atrophy and hemiparesis. Chronic epilepsy later develops, typically involving refractory focal seizures; however, the underlying pathophysiology of this epilepsy is not well understood. We present a boy who had a typical acute presentation of HHE at 23 months, but an unusual evolution to chronic epilepsy in which the initially unaffected hemisphere was significantly abnormal. His initial acute presentation was right-sided hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus, with subsequent left cerebral hemiatrophy and hemiparesis affecting the right face, arm and leg. Focal seizures began at 5 years and were refractory to medical treatment. At 9 years, video EEG monitoring showed a striking pattern of interictal slow spike-wave and paroxysmal fast activity, maximal over the right, initially unaffected, hemisphere. He had primarily focal tonic seizures involving left-sided stiffening, also appearing to originate from the right hemisphere. Following left functional hemispherotomy he became seizure-free and parents reported improved cognitive function, attention and quality of life. This boy had classic features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but expressed almost exclusively over the right hemisphere, which was initially unaffected in his acute presentation of HHE. His evolution to ""hemi-Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype"" illustrates the importance of monitoring chronic epilepsy in patients with HHE; early surgical intervention might prevent pathologic recruitment of bilateral secondary networks leading to the refractory seizures and cognitive impairment associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

In the present study, we investigated effects of rufinamide on cognitive function using passive avoidance test and neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus using Ki-67 (a marker for cell proliferation), doublecortin (DCX, a marker for neuroblast) and BrdU/NeuN (markers for newly generated mature neurons) immunohistochemistry in aged gerbils. Aged gerbils (24-month old) were treated with 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg rufinamide for 4 weeks. Treatment with 3 mg/kg rufinamide, not 1 mg/kg rufinamide, significantly improved cognitive function and increased neurogenesis, showing that proliferating cells (Ki-67-immunoreactive cells), differentiating neuroblasts (DCX-immunoreactive neuroblasts) and mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN-immunoreactive cells) in the aged dentate gyrus compared with those in the control group. When we examined its mechanisms, rufinamide significantly increased immunoreactivities of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), its receptor (IGF-1R), and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB). However, rufinamide did not show any increase in immunoreactivities of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor. Therefore, our results indicate that rufinamide can improve cognitive function and increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the aged gerbil via increasing expressions of IGF-1, IGF-1R and p-CREB.

"	"To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology guideline for managing treatment-resistant (TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 2004 criteria were used to systemically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strength. Forty-two articles were included. The following are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment); rufinamide for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (add-on therapy). The following should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B): lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month-16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6-17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month-4 years). The text presents Level C recommendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, and AED tolerability, safety, and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates seizure types and syndromes needing more evidence. A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.

"	"Developmental encephalopathic epilepsies (DEEs) are characterized by refractory seizures, disability, and early death. Opportunities to improve care and outcomes focus on West syndrome/infantile spasms (WS/IS). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is almost as common but receives little attention. We examined initial presentations of DEEs and their evolution over time to identify risk and indicators of developing LGS. Data are from the Connecticut Study of Epilepsy, a prospective, longitudinal study of 613 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy recruited in 1993-1997. Central review of medical records permitted classification of epilepsy syndromes at diagnosis and at reclassification 2, 5, and 9 years later. DEEs were compared to other epilepsies for seizure and cognitive outcomes and mortality. Analyses examined the evolution of DEE syndromes after initial presentation, with specific comparisons made between WS/IS and LGS. Statistical analyses were performed with t tests and chi-square tests. Fifty-eight children (9.4%) had DEEs, median onset age = 1.1 years (interquartile range ([IQR] 0.3-1.3) in DEEs and 6.0 years (IQR 3.0-9.0) in other epilepsies (P < 0.001). DEEs vs other epilepsies had more pharmacoresistance (71% vs 18%), intellectual disability (84% vs 11%), and mortality (21% vs <1%; all P < 0.001). During follow-up, the form of epilepsy evolved in 33 children. WS/IS was the most common initial diagnosis (N = 23) and in 5 children WS/IS evolved later. LGS was diagnosed initially in 4 children (1 later revised) and in 22 by the end of follow-up, including 7 evolving from WS/IS and 12 from nonsyndromic generalized, focal, or undetermined epilepsies. Evolution to LGS took a median of 1.9 years. LGS developed in 13% of infants, including 9% of those who did not present initially with WS/IS. DEEs account for disproportionate amounts of pharmacoresistance, disability, and early mortality. LGS often has a window between initial presentation and full expression. LGS should become targeted for early detection and prevention.

The present study was undertaken to assess the pharmacokinetics of clobazam administered as single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg compared with clobazam tablets (CTAB) 20 and 10 mg in healthy adults. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg. A total of 51 adult volunteers were enrolled in a single-dose, open-label, randomized four-sequence, four-period, crossover study with treatments (A) COSF 20 mg, (B) CTAB 20 mg, (C) COSF 10 mg, and (D) CTAB 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic sampling for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam was carried out until 21 days postdose with a 28-day washout. Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study. Visual inspections of the administration site were performed before and after COSF administration to monitor for mucosal irritation. COSF at single doses of 10 and 20 mg was bioequivalent to CTAB at equivalent doses for both clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam. The pharmacokinetics of both formulations was dose-proportional at doses of 10 and 20 mg. The number of AEs and the number of subjects experiencing AEs were dose-related across the treatment groups, with somnolence the most common event. None of these events was severe or serious, and most were mild. There was no evidence for local irritation at the administration site following COSF. COSF is a novel clobazam dosage form that is bioequivalent to CTAB. Because of its ease of administration, COSF may be expected to improve adherence, reduce likelihood of dosing error, and provide more accurate dosing than formulations of clobazam that are currently available.

Eleven children restarted ASD after a mean of 7 months. Children achieving DFD therapy were more likely to be younger, have fewer ASDs at KD onset, have Glut1 deficiency or epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, but were less likely to have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or a gastrostomy tube.

"	"The objective of the study was to assess the direct cost of medically treated seizure events in severe childhood-onset epilepsies. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representative conditions associated with frequent intractable seizures. Commercial and Medicaid insurance claims from 2010 to 2015 were queried to identify patients with possible LGS, possible DS, or TSC, having ≥2 years of continuous insurance from the date of first epilepsy/seizure diagnosis or antiepileptic drug (AED) fill (index date). Utilization and cost data in patients with and without seizure events requiring acute treatment were evaluated for two years postindex. Medically treated seizure events resulting in minor, moderate, severe, and no injury were included. Average costs were normalized to 2017 dollars at 3% per annum and reported for each cohort, by insurance type and degree of injury. Among 9754 patients, 55.4-58.8% of LGS, 47.7-55.8% of DS, and 13.7-28.0% of TSC cohorts had ≥1 medically treated seizure event, depending on insurance type. Events during two-year postindex averaged 2.8-3.3 in LGS, 3.1-3.3 in DS, and 1.9-2.2 in TSC; cost per event averaged $8147-$14,759 in LGS, $4637-$8751 in DS, and $5335-$9672 in TSC. In patients with events, average all-cause costs per-patient-per-year (PPPY) were $71,512-$84,939 in LGS; $31,278-$43,758 in DS; and $42,997-$48,330 in TSC. Patients with intractable seizures having at least one medically treated seizure event incur substantial all-cause costs. Our results can be used to inform cost effectiveness and budget impact models to estimate the value of existing and future treatments for these and similar conditions.

Patients were included if they had ≥2 medical claims ≥30 days apart for specified or unspecified epilepsy, excluding those with ≥1 claim for petit mal status. The LGS classifier utilized a random forest algorithm, a compilation of thousands of binary decision trees in which machine-generated predictor variables split the data set into branches that predict the presence or absence of LGS. To construct the splitting rules, the importance of each candidate variable was determined by calculating the mean decrease in Gini impurity. Training and testing were performed on two data sets (30% and 70%) using a ""true"" LGS and non-LGS patient population. Performance was compared with logistic regression and single tree methodology. Using a 60% probability threshold, which yielded the highest sensitivity (97.3%) and specificity (95.6%), the classifier identified approximately 4% of patients with epilepsy as probable LGS. The most important input variables included number of distinct antiepileptic drugs received, epilepsy-related outpatient/inpatient visits, electroencephalogram procedures and claims for delayed development. The random forest methodology outperformed logistic regression and single tree methodology. Most of the important LGS predictor characteristics identified by the classifier were statistically significantly associated with LGS status (p < .05). The claims-based LGS classifier showed high sensitivity and specificity, outperformed single tree and logistic regression methodologies and identified a prevalence of probable LGS that was similar to previously published estimates.

"	"Drug development for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is based on clinical trials that use drop seizure counts. However, such counts do not assess total seizure burden and affect a patient's quality of life (QoL). In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated two novel seizure efficacy parameters related to QoL in pediatric patients with LGS, using seizure diary data from rufinamide Study 303 (NCT01405053). Study 303 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study involving patients aged ≥1 to <4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive add-on therapy with rufinamide or any other approved antiseizure drug (ASD), in addition to their existing treatment of 1-3 ASDs, across a 106-week treatment phase. Seizure diaries, completed by parents or caregivers, recorded seizure occurrence, and were used in this post hoc analysis to evaluate two novel efficacy parameters comparing baseline vs postbaseline mean number of seizure-free days and assessing time to reach the number of prerandomization seizures for patients receiving rufinamide or any other ASD. Patients received rufinamide (n = 25) or any other ASD (n = 12). For rufinamide, mean number of seizure-free days was 42.2% greater postbaseline compared with baseline (P < 0.0001); only one rufinamide patient experienced a decrease in number of seizure-free days postbaseline. Median time to reach the baseline number of seizures increased by 10.5 days for rufinamide and 0.5 days for the any-other-ASD group during the treatment phase, to 46.0 and 54.0 days, respectively. Both of these novel and contrasting endpoints demonstrated potential improvements in seizure outcomes in patients receiving rufinamide postbaseline vs baseline. Although these parameters should be investigated in larger patient populations, our initial findings suggest that they could be applied as predefined primary endpoints for seizure assessment in future clinical trials for LGS drug development.

In addition, CBD is thought to have broad anti-seizure properties that may be beneficial for other types of intractable epilepsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of artisanal medical CBD oil in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) at the tertiary epilepsy center of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome, Italy. This was a single-center, prospective, open-label study. Patients aged from 1 to 18 years with DEE and seizures refractory to appropriate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and other alternative treatments (i.e., vagal nerve stimulator and ketogenic diet) were included. Crystalline extract CBD powder (98-99% pure) in an oil artisanal formulation was added to the baseline AED regimen at a dosage of 2-5 mg/kg/day divided for twice-daily administration, then up-titrated until intolerance or a maximum dosage of 25 mg/kg/day was reached. Patients were treated for at least 6 months. Efficacy, safety and tolerability of CBD treatment were assessed through the evaluation of seizure frequency and reports of adverse effects. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study (41.4% male). The mean duration of exposure to artisanal CBD was 11.2 months [range 6-25 months; standard deviation (SD) ± 4.4 months]. Mean age at study enrollment was 9.3 years (range 1.9-16.3 years; SD ± 4.7 years). Eleven out of 29 patients (37.9%) had a ≥ 50% improvement in seizure frequency; one patient became seizure free. None of the patients reported worsening seizure frequency; however, 18 patients (62.1%) experienced no beneficial effect regarding seizure frequency. Adverse effects were reported in seven patients (24.14%), most commonly somnolence, decreased appetite and diarrhea. Adverse events were mild and transient, and no dose modification of CBD or other AEDs was required. These data suggest that CBD may have beneficial effects in patients with DEE and an acceptable safety profile. Placebo-controlled randomized trials should be conducted to formally assess the safety and efficacy of CBD in patients with DEE.

The FDA approved maximum dosage of clobazam is 1 mg/kg/d or a total of 40 mg a day. Many providers exceed this dosage but there is limited data on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of supratherapeutic doses. We reviewed retrospective data at our institution and compared patients on supratherapeutic doses to patients on therapeutic doses. A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria (65 supratherapeutic, 67 therapeutic). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of seizure control, health care utilization, or side effects between patients on supratherapeutic doses and those on therapeutic doses. This study lends further support to the safety and tolerability of supratherapuetic doses of clobazam.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare, age-related syndrome, characterized by multiple seizure types, mental regression, and specific EEG abnormalities. It is one of the most challenging epilepsy: treatment is rarely effective and the final prognosis remains poor, despite the availability of several antiepileptic drugs, validated through well-designed, randomized, controlled trials. However, it is reasonable to consider non-medical treatments, such as surgery, after failure of two-to-three drugs. This review has as goal to describe systematically the different therapeutic options for LGS, including, not only recognized antiepileptic drugs, but also new oral drugs, immune therapy, diet, surgery, and neurostimulation techniques.

"	"Antiepileptic drugs are the first treatment option in patients with epilepsy. Drugs developed after 2000 are known as third generation antiepileptic drugs. These medications offer new mechanisms of action and favorable pharmacokinetics, decreasing the occurrence of side effects and drug-drug interactions. Broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, such as brivaracetam and clobazam are good choices for generalized tonic colonic seizures and are well tolerated.New sodium channel blockers such as lacosamide and eslicarbazepine, have a more ""benign"" side effect profile than the first or second generation of sodium channel blockers. These new drugs are useful therapies in patients with epilepsy of difficult control. Cannabidiol and fenfluramine are useful in the treatment of Dravet or Lennox Gastaut syndrome. Allopregnenolona and ganaxolone showed good efficacy in status epilepticus and could play an important future role in this clinical scenario.

"	"With this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that the effect of cannabidiol on drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome could be attributed to a drug-drug interaction with clobazam. We performed clinical trial simulations for the effect of 20 mg/kg/day cannabidiol on drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We assumed that patients taking 10 or 20 mg clobazam would have a 2- to 7-fold increase in N-desmethylclobazam exposure, whereas patients not taking clobazam would have a median reduction in drop-seizure frequency and a variability in the percent reduction similar to the placebo group. The results show that the effect of cannabidiol on the median reduction in drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may be explained by a drug-drug interaction with clobazam. This may have important implications for the use of cannabidiol and its Food and Drug Administration registration.

"	"The aim of this report was to refine the genotypes and phenotypes of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2)-related epilepsy. Seventeen patients with CHD2 mutations were enrolled. CHD2 mutations were identified by application of next-generation sequencing of epilepsy or whole exome sequencing. Sixteen mutations were identified, among which 15 have not yet been reported. Thirteen mutations were de novo. Age at seizure onset ranged from 3 months to 10 years 5 months. Seizures observed were generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, atonic, atypical absence, focal, and myoclonic-atonic. Epileptic spasms occurred in two patients. Developmental disability was present in 14 patients. Autism features were observed in seven patients. Video electroencephalogram was abnormal in 15 patients. Five patients were diagnosed with non-specific epileptic encephalopathy, two with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, two with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two with febrile seizures plus, and one with West syndrome. Seizures were controlled in nine patients. Q1392TfsX17 may be a hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome was observed as a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation. The severity of the phenotypes of CHD2 mutations ranged from mild febrile seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathy. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Q1392TfsX17 maybe the hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome could be a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation.

"	"Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked intellectual disorder caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene. Clinical features of CS include an inability to speak, truncal ataxia, postnatal microcephaly, hyperkinesis, and epilepsy. Almost all patients with CS develop drug-resistant epilepsy-its most serious complication. We report two cases of CS with drug-resistant epilpesy associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). One patient experienced generalized tonic seizures since 9 months of age with cognitive regression, which evolved to include atonic seizures at the age of 7 years. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized slow spike-wave complexes and generalized paroxysmal fast activity. Seizures remained drug-resistant despite multiple anti-seizure drugs. The second patient experienced generalized tonic seizures since the age of 17 months and arrested development. EEG showed generalized slow spike-wave complexes, with frequent atonic seizures since the age of 6 years. Electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES) developed at the age of 7 years. Our cases illustrate that CS may cause LGS in addition to other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies of the neonatal and infantile period. We suggest that generalized tonic or tonic-clonic seizures and generalized slow spike-wave complexes in interictal EEG be included as potential electroclinical features of epilepsy in CS.

"	"CBD was shown to have anti-seizure activity based on in vitro and in vivo models. However, several reports of small series or case reports of the use of cannabis extracts in epilepsy yielded contradictory results and the efficacy of cannabis use in patients with epilepsy have also been inconclusive. In 2013, the first Phase 1 trial for a purified form of CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex; >99% CBD), developed by GW Pharma, showed some efficacy signals and subsequently, a comprehensive program on the efficacy and tolerability of this compound for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies was initiated. Results of these trials led to the FDA and EMA approval respectively in 2018 and 2019 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare epilepsies: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients two years of age and older. Thus, CBD became the first FDA-approved purified drug substance derived from cannabis and also the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of seizures in DS. We detail the clinical studies using purified CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex), including the first open interventional exploratory study and Randomized Control Ttrials for DS and LGS.

"	"EEF1A2 encodes protein elongation factor 1-alpha 2, which is involved in Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. De novo mutations in EEF1A2 have been identified in patients with extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, globe developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability. However, the mechanism underlying phenotype variation is unknown. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified a novel and a recurrent de novo mutation, c.294C>A; p.(Phe98Leu) and c.208G>A; p.(Gly70Ser), in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The further systematic analysis revealed that all EEF1A2 mutations were associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability, suggesting its critical role in neurodevelopment. Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in the t-RNA binding sites or GTP hydrolysis domain were associated with early-onset severe epilepsy, indicating that the clinical expression was potentially determined by the location of mutations and alteration of molecular effects. This study highlights the potential genotype-phenotype relationship in EEF1A2 and facilitates the evaluation of the pathogenicity of EEF1A2 mutations in clinical practice.

Two-thirds of patients with epilepsy are controlled with established antiseizure medications, leaving a significant number of patients searching for other options. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advancements in the management of treatment-resistant epilepsy in pediatric patients. Recent publications have shown the efficacy of new pharmaceutical options such as fenfluramine and cannabidiol, some of which have been tested specifically in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes such as Dravet's syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut's syndrome. Furthermore, recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of stiripentol has made available a previously difficult-to-obtain option for patients with Dravet's syndrome. Finally, implanted responsive neurostimulation devices for direct cortical stimulation and deep brain stimulation have shown efficacy in adult patients and may represent a thrilling new horizon for pediatric patients.

32452568	"Does cannabidiol have antiseizure activity independent of its interactions with clobazam? An appraisal of the evidence from randomized controlled trials
"	"Four pivotal randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that adjunctive therapy with cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Between 47% and 68% of patients allocated to CBD treatment in these trials were receiving clobazam (CLB), which shows complex interactions with CBD resulting, in particular, in a 3.4- to 5-fold increase in plasma concentration of the active metabolite norclobazam. This raises concern as to the role played by these interactions in determining the reduction in seizure frequency in CBD-treated patients, and the question of whether CBD per se has clinically evident antiseizure effects. We appraised available evidence on the clinical consequences of the CBD-CLB interaction, focusing on subgroup analyses of seizure outcomes in patients on and off CLB comedication in the pivotal CBD trials, as provided by the European Medicines Agency Public Assessment Report. Evaluation of the results of individual trials clearly showed that improvement in seizure control over placebo was greater when CBD was added on to CLB than when it was added on to other medications. However, seizure control was also improved in patients off CLB, and despite the small sample size the difference vs placebo was statistically significant for the 10 mg/kg/d dose in one of the two LGS trials. Stronger evidence for an antiseizure effect of CBD independent of an interaction with CLB emerges from meta-analyses of seizure outcomes in the pooled population of LGS and DS patients not receiving CLB comedication. Although these results need to be interpreted taking into account methodological limitations, they provide the best clinical evidence to date that CBD exerts therapeutic effects in patients with epilepsy that are independent of its interaction with CLB. Greater antiseizure effects, and a greater burden of adverse effects, are observed when CBD is combined with CLB.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a rare form of childhood epilepsy. Rufinamide is an orphan drug indicated for the treatment of LGS. Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) is a process in which solid objects are created based on a digital file by adding materials layer by layer. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a 3DP technique with the advantages of solid dispersion systems and the ability to use various pharmaceutical excipients in small scales, which makes this technology favorable for the production of orphan drugs. Rufinamide is a water-insoluble lipophilic compound which can exist in different polymorphic forms. The therapeutic dose is 3200 mg/day, at which rufinamide exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, which may be attributed to its limited solubility. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the dissolution of rufinamide through the use of 3DP technology. For this purpose, optimum 3DP tablets were developed based on 3DP manufacturability and dissolution behaviors. The findings suggest that a mixture of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), Soluplus®, Kollidon® VA64, Gelucire® 48/16 and Triacetin are suitable excipients for FDM-3DP technology that can improve the dissolution of rufinamide. The optimum 3DP tablet shows significantly higher dissolution than Inovelon® at the therapeutic dose due to its improved wdissolution.

"	"For patients with generalized epilepsy who do not respond to antiseizure medications, the therapeutic options are limited. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a treatment mainly approved for therapy-resistant focal epilepsy. There is limited information on the use of VNS on generalized epilepsies, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). We identified patients with a diagnosis of generalized epilepsy (including LGS and GGE), who underwent VNS implantation at the London Health Sciences Centre and Western University, London, Ontario, since this treatment became available in Canada in 1997 until July 2018. We assessed response to the treatment, including admissions to hospital and complications. A total of 46 patients were included in this study with a history of therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy. The mean age at implantation was 24 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 17.8-31 years), significantly younger in the LGS group (p = 0.02) and 50% (n = 23) were female. The most common etiologies were GGE in 37% (n = 17) and LGS in 63% (n = 29). Median follow-up since VNS implantation was 63 months (IQR: 31-112.8 months). Of the LGS group 41.7% (n = 12) of patients had an overall seizure reduction of 50% or more, and 64.7% (n = 11) in the GGE group without statistical significance between the groups. The best response in seizure reduction was seen in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with a significant reduction in the GGE group (p = 0.043). There was a reduction of seizure-related hospital admissions from 91.3% (N = 42) preimplantation, to 43.5% (N = 20) postimplantation (p < 0.05). The frequency of side effects due to the stimulation was almost equal in both groups (62.1% in LGS and 64.7% in GGE). Vagus nerve stimulation should be considered as a treatment in patients with therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy, especially in cases with GGE.

"	"The South African (SA) Constitutional Court recently decriminalised the private cultivation, possession and use of cannabis by adults. Cannabis contains varying amounts of the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), depending on various cultivation factors. No commercial plant-derived cannabis products are currently registered by the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for medical use. Such products are therefore unregulated, but are freely available in SA, and may be of inadequate quality and unverified composition, and not guaranteed to be safe or effective. SAHPRA has to date approved only one synthetic medical cannabis product, dronabinol. Evidence supporting benefit from medical cannabis exists for two drug-resistant childhood forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Adjuvant therapy with medical cannabis can reduce seizure frequency for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome by 18.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and may be beneficial for other rare forms of epilepsy. There is moderate evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with the synthetic cannabinoids. Multiple sclerosis-associated spasticity showed a small clinical improvement in self-reported spasticity when a purified form of THC/CBD was added to existing therapy. Currently, low-level or no convincing evidence exists for the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain, sleep and weight disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Cannabis is associated with a greater risk of adverse effects than active and placebo controls, and may be involved in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. The evolving regulatory and legal landscape on the use of medical cannabis will guide prescription and recreational use in the coming years.

This noninvasive approach is well-suited for use in a palliative intervention for improved seizure control in this patient population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of radiosurgical completion corpus callosotomy in an adult in the United States. A 20-year-old ambidextrous nonverbal man with a history of refractory generalized epilepsy status post open anterior corpus callosotomy at age 10 years, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and autism presented after 2 years of incremental, progressive deterioration in seizure control and behavior including 1 year. The family decided to pursue SRS corpus callosotomy. Under general anesthesia, a volume of interest encompassing a full midsagittal plane of the corpus callosum was defined to deliver 60 Gy to the 50% isodose line fully encompassing the target. Gamma Knife was used with 2 isocenters at 90° and 1 at 110° and isodose lines of 60, 20, and 12 Gy. Treatment was carried out without difficulty or complications while the patient remained under close monitoring. The patient was discharged the next day with a 2-week taper of dexamethasone. Eight months postradiosurgical corpus callosotomy, the patient is free of atonic seizures and is ambulatory. In carefully selected cases and with protective radiosurgical planning, SRS for completion corpus callosotomy represents an effective option for refractory seizure control.

We aimed to obtain knowledge about clinical experience and attitudes toward cannabinoid use for epilepsy treatment among neuropediatricians in Scandinavia and Germany in the era before a CBD-product was commercially licensed and available. Study design: An internet-based questionnaire (Survey Monkey) was distributed by email to members of neuropediatric societies in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Norway between February and April 2018. One reminder email was sent. Results: Eighty-six responded. Only 10 of 86 (12%) respondents had personal experience with off-label prescription of cannabinoid-based products, mainly for severe refractory pediatric epilepsies like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, 49 respondents (57%) had been exposed to relatives of patients that had requested or wanted to discuss cannabinoid therapy, and 32 (37%) respondents knew about cannabinoid self-medication. The knowledge regarding cannabinoid-based therapy among the respondents was overall limited. Main reasons for not prescribing cannabinoid-based therapy were concerns about law regulations and lack of an available product. Conclusion: Off-label cannabinoid-based therapy for pediatric epilepsy was not widely prescribed by neuropediatricians in Scandinavia and Germany in 2018.

We report a successful case of lung procurement from an extended-criteria uncontrolled DCD. We evaluated the lungs of an uncontrolled DCD from a hospital without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. The donor was a non-smoker 20-year old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, cardiocirculatory arrests, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Cardiac arrest occurred in a swimming pool, and bronchoscopy showed signs of inhalation. We employed our usual normothermic in-situ open-ventilated lung approach. After retrieval, lungs were stored on ice, then evaluated with ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and judged suitable for transplantation. The recipient was a 26-year old female with cystic fibrosis on long-term oxygen therapy, on the waitlist for up to 21 months due to her anthropomorphic characteristics. She required central VA-ECMO support during bilateral lung transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) within the first 72 h reached grade 3; post-operative peripheral VV-ECMO support was discontinued two days after surgery. The patient was discharged 28 days after surgery; she is alive two years after transplantation with no signs of rejection nor anastomotic complications. Despite the spreading use of lungs from controlled DCD, perplexities remain on uncontrolled DCD, namely: severe PDG, postoperative mortality, airway complications. Our case report suggests that good results can be achieved with uncontrolled DCD despite the presence of relative contraindications: inhalation of water, prolonged ischemic times and recipient in poor conditions.

To identify the safety and efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation in children with intractable epilepsy and analyze the effects on different epilepsy syndromes. Eligible children with intractable epilepsy were admitted to the study. We collected data from preoperative assessments as the baseline. During the follow-up time, we recorded the process of seizures (frequency, duration, and seizure type), the changes of drugs or parameters, the complications, etc. The mean reduction rate of seizures, response rate, and McHugh scale were chosen as the outcomes. A total of 213 patients were implanted with Tsinghua Pins vagus nerve stimulators, and the average age was 6.6 years. In the follow-up time of postoperative 3 mo, 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo, the average reduction rate was 30.2%, 49.5%, 56.3%, 59.4%, and 63.2%, while the response rate was 21.8%, 62.5%, 57.1%, 69.2%, and 70.7%. In addition, implanted vagus nerve stimulation had different effects on epilepsy syndromes. The reduction rate of West syndrome increased from 36.4% (postoperative 6 m) to 74.3% (postoperative 24 m). The reduction rate of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome improved from 25.4% to 73.1% in 24 mo. The chi-square test of the five efficacy grades showed P < 0.05.

"	"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are severe seizure disorders that occur in infants and young children, characterized by developmental delay, cognitive decline, and early mortality. Recent efforts have identified a wide variety of genetic variants that cause DEEs. Among these, variants in the DNM1 gene have emerged as definitive causes of DEEs, including infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A mouse model of Dnm1-associated DEE, known as ""Fitful"" (Dnm1Ftfl ), recapitulates key features of the disease, including spontaneous seizures, early lethality, and neuronal degeneration. Previous work showed that DNM1 is a key regulator of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis and synaptic transmission and suggested that inhibitory neurotransmission may be more reliant on DNM1 function than excitatory transmission. The Dnm1Ftfl variant is thought to encode a dominant negative DNM1 protein; however, the effects of the Dnm1Ftfl variant on synaptic transmission are largely unknown. To understand these synaptic effects, we recorded from pairs of cultured mouse cortical neurons and characterized all four major connection types [excitation of excitation (E-E), inhibition of inhibition (I-I), E-I, I-E]. Miniature and spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were larger, but less frequent, at all Dnm1Ftfl synaptic types, and Dnm1Ftfl neurons had reduced expression of excitatory and inhibitory SV markers. Baseline evoked transmission, however, was reduced only at inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons, because of a smaller pool of releasable SVs. In addition to these synaptic alterations, Dnm1Ftfl neurons degenerated later in development, although their activity levels were reduced, suggesting that Dnm1Ftfl may impair synaptic transmission and neuronal health through distinct mechanisms.

This study was conducted retrospectively with patients between the ages of 2-18 years diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) were enrolled from March to October 2019, who visited outpatient unit at 3 and 6 months to evaluate medication efficacy and safety based on caregiver reporting. Additional evaluations, such as electroencephalogram and blood tests, were conducted at each period also. CBD was administered orally at a starting dose of 5 mg/kg/day, and was maintained at 10 mg/kg/day. We analyzed 34 patients in the LGS group and 10 patients in the DS group between the ages of 1.2-15.8 years. In the 3-month evaluation, the overall reduction of seizure frequency in the LGS group was 52.9% (>50% reduction in 32.3% of the cases), and 29.4% in the 6-month evaluation (more than 50% reduction in 20.6%). In DS group, the reduction of seizure frequency by more than 50% was 30% and 20% in the 3-month and 6-month evaluation, respectively. Good outcomes were defined as the reduction of seizure frequency by more than 50% and similar results were observed in both LGS and DS groups. Adverse events were reported in 36.3% of total patients of which most common adverse events were gastrointestinal problems. However, no life-threatening adverse event was reported in both LGS and DS during the observation period. In this first Korean study, CBD was safe and tolerable for use and could be expected to potentially reduce the seizure frequency in pediatric patients with LGS or DS.

33398534	"Efficacy of clobazam as add-on therapy in brain tumor-related epilepsy.
"	"Brain tumor-related epilepsy (TRE) is often resistant to currently available antiepileptic medications (AEDs). Clobazam was initially approved as adjunctive AED for patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome but has been used in TRE, despite limited evidence in this context. This observational study aims to examine the effect of clobazam on seizure frequency on patients who have a primary CNS tumor and continued seizures despite their current AEDs. A retrospective review of patients with histologically-confirmed primary brain tumors seen in the neuro-oncology interdisciplinary clinic from April 2016-2019 was completed, and patients on clobazam were identified. Response to clobazam was defined as a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Additional data including patient and tumor characteristics, treatment course, tolerability, AEDs used prior to addition of clobazam, and AEDs concomitantly used with clobazam were collected. A total of 35 patients with TRE on clobazam were identified, with 2 patients unable to tolerate the medication due to side effects. Of the 33 remaining patients, a total of 31 (93.9%) of patients were deemed responders. Ten patients (30.3%) were seizure free within 6 months of clobazam initiation and 21 (63.6%) reported a significant reduction in seizure frequency. This reduction also allowed several patients to modify concurrent AEDs. Clobazam is an effective agent to use as add-on AED in TRE, with 94% of patients showing a significant response within 6 months. Furthermore, the addition of clobazam may yield a reduction in polypharmacy, as concomitant AEDs can be reduced and potentially withdrawn.

"	"We aim to describe the long term follow-up of a cohort of children exposed in utero to the Zika virus. Descriptive study of a cohort of microcephalic children due to Zika virus. Logistic regression was used to evaluate variables associated with worse prognosis epilepsy. We followed 28 children (15 females), with a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR = 12-28). During the follow-up, 1 infant died. The median head circumference at birth was 29 cm (IQR = 27-31). All presented a global developmental delay. The most frequent central nervous system abnormalities were on cortical development in 22 participants; dysgenesis of corpus callosum in 13; ventriculomegaly in 25; and calcifications in 24. A total of 9 presented ocular abnormalities, 4 auditory impairment. During follow-up, 12 presented with sleep disorders, 10 with irritability, and 23 with epilepsy (2 with generalized tonic-clonic, 3 with generalized tonic-clonic and spasms, 12 with spasms, 3 tonic and spasms, and 3 motor focal and spasms). The median age at the begin of the epilepsy was 4 months (IQR = 2-10), the median number of drugs used to control the epilepsy was 2 (IQR = 2-3). Maternal illicit drug use during pregnancy was associated with worse prognosis epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome, or status epilepticus). A total of 19 presented with dysphagia, 10 children required gastrostomy. Children with microcephaly due to Zika virus presented with several complications during follow-up, as epilepsy, spastic diplegia, and global developmental delay.

33693596	"Consciousness among delta waves: a paradox?
"	"A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the appearance of delta (1 - 4 Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high amplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are very frequently observed in states of diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalised epileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness such as coma and vegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high amplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical deactivation that occurs during the ""down states"" or troughs of these slow oscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of prominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the hypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of unconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, behavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful psychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely unacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients with high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a largely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the complexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalogram or MEG signals strongly relates to an individual's level of consciousness. Having reviewed this literature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming contradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We also consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we conclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by examining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral power.

33764203	"Evolution of Infantile Spasms to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: What Is There to Know?
"	"Children with infantile spasms may develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are vague, and many experts use varying combinations of the following criteria for diagnosis: paroxysmal fast activity on electroencephalography (EEG), slow spike and wave on EEG, developmental delay, multiple seizure types, and nocturnal tonic seizures. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a high-risk cohort of children with a history of infantile spasms and the characteristics of infantile spasms that were associated with the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Children with infantile spasms who were diagnosed and treated at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2012 and 2018 were included. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was defined as having 3 of 5 of the following characteristics: paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike and wave, current developmental delay, multiple seizure types, or tonic seizures. Descriptive statistics were performed using median and interquartile range. Univariable analysis was performed with Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Ninety-seven children met inclusion criteria, and 36% (35/97) met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Developmental delay and history of seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms were identified as risk factors for the development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .003) as was poor response to first treatment for spasms (P = .004). Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .019). Eighty percent (28/35) of the children who met Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria lacked a documented diagnosis. Thirty-six percent of children with infantile spasms met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Risk factors for development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were developmental delay and seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms and poor response to first treatment for infantile spasms. Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eighty percent of the children who met our criteria were not given a documented diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which highlights the fact that many children may not be receiving a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We recommend establishing clear guidelines for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to ensure that the diagnosis is being made accurately.

"	"High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is standard treatment for airway clearance in the USA and has recently been introduced in the UK and Europe. There is little published research comparing HFCWO with airway clearance techniques (ACTs) frequently used in the UK and Europe. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effects of HFCWO with usual ACTs in patients with cystic fibrosis hospitalised with an infective pulmonary exacerbation. A 4-day randomised crossover design was used. Patients received either HFCWO on days 1 and 3 and usual ACTs on days 2 and 4 or vice versa. Wet weight of sputum, spirometry and oxygen saturation were measured. Perceived efficacy, comfort, incidence of urinary leakage and preference were assessed. Data were analysed by mixed model analysis. 29 patients (72% male) of mean (SD) age 29.4 (8.4) years and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) percentage predicted (FEV(1)%) 38 (16.7) completed the study. Significantly more sputum was expectorated during a single treatment session and over a 24 h period (mean difference 4.4 g and 6.9 g, respectively) with usual ACTs than with HFCWO (p<0.001). No statistically significant change in FEV(1)% or oxygen saturation was observed after either HFCWO or usual ACTs compared with baseline. 17 patients (55%) expressed a preference for their usual ACT. During both a finite treatment period and over 24 h, less sputum was cleared using HFCWO than usual ACT. HFCWO does not appear to cause any adverse physiological effects and may influence adherence.

20030794	"Acute cellular rejection and Epstein-Barr virus-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in a pediatric lung transplant with low viral load
"	"We report the case of an 18-year-old male who underwent bilateral lung transplantation for end-stage cystic fibrosis. No Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus serology mismatch was detected on pre-transplant evaluation (donor and recipient were both positive). Two months after lung transplantation a computed tomography scan showed multiple nodules throughout both lungs. At that time a low EBV DNA blood level was detected (<300 copies/100,000 lymphomonocytes). Scheduled follow-up transbronchial biopsy (TBB) revealed a prevalent finding characterized by perivascular lymphoid infiltrates with endothelitis. Extensive tissue coagulative necrosis with peripheral areas of dense aggregates of larger lymphoid cells were detected in the trans-thoracic fine needle core biopsy (FNCB) performed on the largest nodule. The immunophenotypic profile characterized the perivascular lymphoid cells in TBB as mainly composed of T lymphocytes (CD3 positive) while the larger number of lymphocytes in FNCB as B cells (CD20 positive). In situ hybridization for EBV (EBER mRNA) was negative in TBB while it was positive in many lymphocytes of the FNCB. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EBV was performed on paraffin-embedded FNCB and detected a high quantity of EBV genomes (1260 copies/cell). IgH gene rearrangement using a fragment size PCR technique revealed a monoclonal B-cell population in FNCB. Morphological and molecular findings suggest a final diagnosis of acute cellular rejection and a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) EBV-related in a lung transplant recipient with a low EBV DNA blood level. A possible coexistence of PTLD and acute rejection should be considered both for diagnosis and treatment. EBV PCR in the peripheral blood is a useful screening tool in transplant recipients; however, rare cases with PTLD may not have detectable levels of EBV DNA. This aspect should be taken into consideration to avoid false negatives.

20052366	"The L441P mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and its molecular pathogenic mechanisms in a Korean patient with cystic fibrosis
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder usually found in populations of white Caucasian descent. CF is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. A 5-yr-old Korean girl was admitted complaining of coughing and greenish sputum. Chest radiographs and computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed diffuse bronchiectasis in both lungs. The patient had chronic diarrhea and poor weight gain, and the abdominal pancreaticobiliary CT scan revealed atrophy of the pancreas. Finally, CF was confirmed by the repeated analysis of the quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test. The chloride concentration of sweat samples taken from both forearms of the pateint was an average of 88.7 mM/L (normal value <40 mM/L). After a comprehensive search for mutations in the CFTR gene, the patient was found to carry the non-synonymous L441P mutation in one allele. Molecular physiologic analysis of the L441P mutation of CFTR revealed that the L441P mutation completely abolished the CFTR Cl(-) channel activity by disrupting proper protein folding and membrane trafficking of CFTR protein. These results confirmed the pathogenicity of the L441P mutation of CFTR circulating in the Korean population. The possibility of CF should be suspected in patients with chronic bronchiectasis, although the frequency of CF is relatively rare in East Asia.

20093376	"Swarming motility, secretion of type 3 effectors and biofilm formation phenotypes exhibited within a large cohort of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates
"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen capable of acutely infecting or persistently colonizing susceptible hosts. P. aeruginosa colonizes surfaces in vitro by either biofilm formation or swarming motility. The choice of behaviour is influenced by the physical properties of the surface and specific nutrient availability, and subject to regulatory networks that also govern type 2 and type 3 protein secretion. Biofilm formation by clinical isolates has been well-studied. However, the swarming behaviour of human isolates has not been extensively analysed. We collected isolates from 237 hospitalized patients without cystic fibrosis and analysed motility and secretion phenotypes of each isolate. We found biofilm formation and swarming to be negatively associated, while swarming was positively associated with the secretion of both proteases and type 3 exoenzymes. Most isolates were capable of type 3 secretion and biofilm formation, even though these traits are considered to favour distinct modes of pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate that while clinical isolates display diverse motility, biofilm and secretion phenotypes, many of the predicted relationships between swarming motility and other phenotypes observed in laboratory strains also hold true for bacteria isolated from human patients.

20142516	"Regulation of conductance by the number of fixed positive charges in the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR chloride channel pore
"	"Rapid chloride permeation through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel is dependent on the presence of fixed positive charges in the permeation pathway. Here, we use site-directed mutagenesis and patch clamp recording to show that the functional role played by one such positive charge (K95) in the inner vestibule of the pore can be ""transplanted"" to a residue in a different transmembrane (TM) region (S1141). Thus, the mutant channel K95S/S1141K showed Cl(-) conductance and open-channel blocker interactions similar to those of wild-type CFTR, thereby ""rescuing"" the effects of the charge-neutralizing K95S mutation. Furthermore, the function of K95C/S1141C, but not K95C or S1141C, was inhibited by the oxidizing agent copper(II)-o-phenanthroline, and this inhibition was reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting disulfide bond formation between these two introduced cysteine side chains. These results suggest that the amino acid side chains of K95 (in TM1) and S1141 (in TM12) are functionally interchangeable and located closely together in the inner vestibule of the pore. This allowed us to investigate the functional effects of increasing the number of fixed positive charges in this vestibule from one (in wild type) to two (in the S1141K mutant). The S1141K mutant had similar Cl(-) conductance as wild type, but increased susceptibility to channel block by cytoplasmic anions including adenosine triphosphate, pyrophosphate, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, and Pt(NO(2))(4)(2-) in inside-out membrane patches. Furthermore, in cell-attached patch recordings, apparent voltage-dependent channel block by cytosolic anions was strengthened by the S1141K mutation. Thus, the Cl(-) channel function of CFTR is maximal with a single fixed positive charge in this part of the inner vestibule of the pore, and increasing the number of such charges to two causes a net decrease in overall Cl(-) transport through a combination of failure to increase Cl(-) conductance and increased susceptibility to channel block by cytosolic substances.

"	"Gel-forming mucins are large high-molecular weight secreted O-glycoproteins responsible for the gel-properties of the mucus blanket. Five orthologous gel-forming mucins have been cloned in human and mouse. Among them, the mucin MUC6 has been less studied, particularly in rodents and no anti rodent-Muc6 antibody has been reported yet. In order to further study Muc6 in mice, our aims were to obtain a specific Muc6 antibody, to validate it and to test it in Cftr deficient mice. A polyclonal serum named CP4 was isolated from a rabbit immunized by a mouse Muc6 peptide. In Western blot experiments, the antibody detected a high-molecular weight molecule secreted by the gastric tissue. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that the antibody reacted strongly with deep glands of duodenum and ileum and mucous neck cells of gastric body. CP4 also recognized Muc6 protein secreted at the surface of the stomach and renal collecting tubules. The centroacinar cells of pancreatic tissue also reacted with the antibody. Cftr-/- mice showed a higher expression of Muc6 at both protein and RNA levels compared with their control Cftr+/+ littermates suggesting that as in the human disease, Muc6 may contribute to the formation of materials that block pancreatic acini and ducts in mouse models of cystic fibrosis. The rabbit anti-mouse Muc6 polyclonal antibody seems highly specific to the mouse mucin and will be useful to study pancreatic pathology in cystic fibrosis.

"	"Antibiotic therapy for acute pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis is usually chosen based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility. This can be difficult when bacteria are multiresistant. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the tolerance and efficiency of ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) in the treatment of acute exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients who were chronically colonized with multiresistant P. aeruginosa. Seventeen severe patients, with FEV(1)=1070+/-66 mL and BMI=18+/-0.6 kg/m(2), who had chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa with intermediate sensitivity or resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam, were studied between June 2003 and March 2007. Oxygen saturation, dyspnoea, weight, FEV(1), FVC, and tolerance were evaluated before and after antibiotic courses. Forty-two courses of treatment, administered between June 2003 and March 2007 were studied: Patients increased their FEV(1) and FVC (p=0.01). One antibiotic course was stopped after four days because of cutaneous side effects. The median delay until the next exacerbation was 101+/-10 days. These courses were compared with other combinations of antibiotics that the patients had received before. The combination of ceftazidime and aztreonam was more effective in patients receiving less than four courses per year for acute pulmonary exacerbation. In chronically P. aeruginosa colonised cystic fibrosis patients, ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) is well tolerated and efficient. This treatment suggests a clinical and functional benefit is possible, even in patients with severe disease.

"	"The nasal potential difference (PD) demonstrates the increased Na absorption and decreased Cl secretion typically found in cystic fibrosis (CF). It provides useful information for diagnostic purposes and measures the effect of new treatments on the ion transport defects found in CF. This study summarizes the nasal PD results in the respiratory tract of different groups of subjects, examines the responses in squamous epithelia and evaluates new ways to consider nasal PD results.Nasal PD was tested using the standard protocol of baseline, amiloride, low chloride, and isoproterenol solutions in 40 healthy non-CF volunteers, 46 CF subjects, and 78 subjects referred for investigation of possible CF. Nasal PD was also measured in the squamous epithelium at the anterior nares in six non-CF subjects.Baseline PD was elevated in the CF (47.5 (1.7) mV) compared with non-CF subjects: (14.0 (0.8) mV, P < 0.00001). Combined [Cl + Isop] responses were smaller in the CF (-0.1 (0.4) mV) compared with the non-CF subjects (26.2 (1.2) mV, P < 0.00001). In the diagnostic cohort 58 were given a non-CF diagnosis, 16 had CF confirmed, but 4 remained indeterminate. Separate consideration of Na and Cl transport was easily portrayed through X-Y plots. Finally, the nasal PD responses of squamous epithelium showed high baseline values, but little response to amiloride and low chloride solutions.The nasal PD provides useful information in the diagnostic algorithm of CF, and in the delineation of the two ion transport defects characteristically found in the respiratory epithelium. Avoidance of the squamous epithelium remains an important consideration for those performing and interpreting nasal PD responses.

This population needs special care regarding comorbidities and related complications. MB, a 38-year-old Italian cystic fibrosis male patient with lung and pancreatic involvement, was referred to our division in July 2009 for fever-associated arthromyalgia, headache, and rhinitis. Lung transplantation had been performed in September 2005, and he was subsequently treated with immunosuppressive therapy: tacrolimus, everolimus, and prednisolone. In the past, chronic respiratory colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and intermittent infection with Aspergillus flavus, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus complicated his clinical history. He started antiviral treatment with oseltamivir despite no travel history and no respiratory symptoms. H1N1 swab was positive. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for the persistence of fever and the onset of cough. Chest x-ray showed a left lower pneumonia, which was confirmed by computerized tomography. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy led to an improvement of the clinical condition. The patient was discharged 8 days later; a control swab was negative. This case report suggests some general considerations regarding solid organ recipients: 1) Flu-related complications require early treatment (both antiviral and antibiotic); 2) active microbiologic surveillance is important to prevent lethal infections (ie, invasive aspergillosis); 3) evaluation of immunosuppressant blood levels is necessary for drug-drug interactions. Active prevention is the best option for decreasing morbidity and mortality in the transplanted patient.

An inflammatory mass within the head of his pancreas was confirmed using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and pancreatic biopsy, but serum amylase and lipase remained normal throughout the acute phase of his illness. His symptoms and the pancreatic mass resolved following the insertion of a biliary stent and the introduction of ursodeoxycholic acid. Our case report highlights the potential for acute pancreatitis to occur in patients with pancreatic insufficiency and cystic fibrosis. We further demonstrate that conventional biochemical markers that are normally assessed to confirm the diagnosis may not be of particular use. As patients with cystic fibrosis survive into their fourth and fifth decades of life, atypical presentations of acute pancreatitis may become more common.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, and the gene responsible is the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Patients with CF have repeated bacterial infection of the airways caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which is one of the predominant pathogen, and endobronchial chronic infection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a gene that encodes the antimicrobial protein, PTX3, which is believed to have an important role in innate immunity of lung. To address the role of PTX3 in the risk of PA lung colonization, we investigated five single nucleotide polymorphisms of PTX3 gene in 172 Caucasian CF patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. We observed that PTX3 haplotype frequencies were significantly different between patients with PA colonization, as compared with noncolonized patients. Moreover, a protective effect was found in association with a specific haplotype (odds ratio 0.524). Our data suggest that variations within PTX3 affect lung colonization of Pseudomonas in patients with CF.

"	"Transport of chloride through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel is a key step in regulating fluid secretion in vertebrates [1, 2]. Loss of CFTR function leads to cystic fibrosis [1, 3, 4], a disease that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and vas deferens. Conversely, uncontrolled activation of the channel leads to increased fluid secretion and plays a major role in several diseases and conditions including cholera [5, 6] and other secretory diarrheas [7] as well as polycystic kidney disease [8-10]. Understanding how CFTR activity is regulated in vivo has been limited by the lack of a genetic model. Here, we used a forward genetic approach in zebrafish to uncover CFTR regulators. We report the identification, isolation, and characterization of a mutation in the zebrafish cse1l gene that leads to the sudden and dramatic expansion of the gut tube. We show that this phenotype results from a rapid accumulation of fluid due to the uncontrolled activation of the CFTR channel. Analyses in zebrafish larvae and mammalian cells indicate that Cse1l is a negative regulator of CFTR-dependent fluid secretion. This work demonstrates the importance of fluid homeostasis in development and establishes the zebrafish as a much-needed model system to study CFTR regulation in vivo.

Different experimental parameters were analyzed, including frequency and amplitude of vibration, polymer pumping rate and distance between the nozzle and the gelling bath. We have found that the microencapsulation procedure does not alter the viability of the encapsulated IB3-1 cells. The encapsulated IB3-1 cells were characterized in term of secretomic profile, analyzing the culture medium by Bio-Plex strategy. The experiments demonstrated that most of the analyzed proteins, were secreted both by the free and encapsulated cells, even if in a different extent. In order to determine the biotechnological applications of this procedure, we determined whether encapsulated IB3-1 cells could be induced to pro-inflammatory responses, after treatment with TNF-α. In this experimental set-up, encapsulated and free IB3-1 cells were treated with TNF-α, thereafter the culture media from both cell populations were collected. As expected, TNF-α induced a sharp increase in the secretion of interleukins, chemokines and growth factors. Of great interest was the evidence that induction of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 occurs also by encapsulated IB3-1 cells.

"	"Antibiotic therapy is thought to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by decreasing neutrophil-derived inflammation. We investigated the origin and clinical significance of lactate in the chronically inflamed CF lung. Lactate was measured in sputa of 18 exacerbated and 25 stable CF patients via spectrophotometry and gaschromatography. Lung function was assessed via spirometry. Seven patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and three patients with acute lung inflammation served as control groups. Neutrophil and bacterial lactate production was assessed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In sputum specimens of patients with respiratory exacerbations lactate concentrations decreased significantly (p<0.005) from 3.4±2.3mmol/L to 1.4±1.4mmol/L after 2-3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Successful treatment was reflected in 16 patients (88.9%) by FVC increase associated with lactate decrease (p<0.05). In every single sputum lactate was detectable (3.0±3.1mmol/L, range 0.2-14.1mmol/L). Lactate was lower (1.6±0.8mmol/L) in sputa from seven COPD patients, and it was below the detection limit in three patients with acute lung inflammation. Neutrophil lactate production accumulated up to 10.5mmol/L after 4 days, whereas bacterial lactate production did not appear to contribute substantially to sputum lactate concentrations. Successful antibiotic therapy is reflected by a decrease in lactate concentrations. Neutrophils are the most likely source for lactate in sputum of CF patients. Therefore lactate may be used to monitor responses to antibiotic therapy as an adjunct to lung function measurements.

21030607	"Physiological relevance of cell-specific distribution patterns of CFTR, NKCC1, NBCe1, and NHE3 along the crypt-villus axis in the intestine
"	"We examined the cell-specific subcellular expression patterns for sodium- and potassium-coupled chloride (NaK2Cl) cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), Na(+) bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) to understand the functional plasticity and synchronization of ion transport functions along the crypt-villus axis and its relevance to intestinal disease. In the unstimulated intestine, all small intestinal villus enterocytes coexpressed apical CFTR and NHE3, basolateral NBCe1, and mostly intracellular NKCC1. All (crypt and villus) goblet cells strongly expressed basolateral NKCC1 (at approximately three-fold higher levels than villus enterocytes), but no CFTR, NBCe1, or NHE3. Lower crypt cells coexpressed apical CFTR and basolateral NKCC1, but no NHE3 or NBCe1 (except NBCe1-expressing proximal colonic crypts). CFTR, NBCe1, and NKCC1 colocalized with markers of early and recycling endosomes, implicating endocytic recycling in cell-specific anion transport. Brunner's glands of the proximal duodenum coexpressed high levels of apical/subapical CFTR and basolateral NKCC1, but very low levels of NBCe1, consistent with secretion of Cl(-)-enriched fluid into the crypt. The cholinergic agonist carbachol rapidly (within 10 min) reduced cell volume along the entire crypt/villus axis and promoted NHE3 internalization into early endosomes. In contrast, carbachol induced membrane recruitment of NKCC1 and CFTR in all crypt and villus enterocytes, NKCC1 in all goblet cells, and NBCe1 in all villus enterocytes. These observations support regulated vesicle traffic in Cl(-) secretion by goblet cells and Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) secretion by villus enterocytes during the transient phase of cholinergic stimulation. Overall, the carbachol-induced membrane trafficking profile of the four ion transporters supports functional plasticity of the small intestinal villus epithelium that enables it to conduct both absorptive and secretory functions.

"	"Inflammation resulting from chronic bacterial infection in the lung contributes to long-term pulmonary complications in chronic pulmonary infections such as cystic fibrosis. Aerosol administration of levofloxacin as in the form of the investigational formulation MP-376 results in higher concentrations in lung tissues that are higher than those that can be attained with oral or intravenous dosing of levofloxacin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of high concentrations of levofloxacin achieved with aerosol administration of MP-376 on proinflammatory cytokine secretion by immortalized human bronchial epithelia cells in vitro. Additionally, we investigated the potential mechanisms of the immunomodulatory effect of levofloxacin. In vitro studies in human lung epithelial cell lines showed that levofloxacin led to a dose-related reduction in IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations, with 300 μg mL(-1) resulting in the reduction of levels of IL-6 by fourfold and IL-8 by twofold (P<0.05); in contrast, tobramycin increased IL-6 levels by 50%, but had no effect on IL-8. Levofloxacin treatment did not affect the cytokine mRNA level and nuclear factor-κB-dependent promoter activity. These findings suggest that high concentrations of levofloxacin obtained in pulmonary tissues following the administration of aerosol MP-376 may provide additional benefits in patients with chronic pulmonary infections that are independent of its antibacterial properties.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder which despite advances in medical care continues to be a life-limiting and often fatal disease. With increase in life expectancy of the CF population, bone disease has emerged as a common complication. Unlike the osteoporosis seen in postmenopausal population, bone disease in CF begins at a young age and is associated with significant morbidity due to fractures, kyphosis, increased pain, and decreased lung function. The maintenance of bone health is essential for the CF population during their lives to prevent pain and fractures but also as they approach lung transplantation since severe bone disease can lead to exclusion from lung transplantation. Early recognition, prevention, and treatment are key to maintaining optimal bone health in CF patients and often require a multidisciplinary approach. This article will review the pathophysiology, current clinical practice guidelines, and potential future therapies for treating CF-related bone disease.

Central haemodynamic parameters; including augmentation index (AIx) and wasted left ventricular pressure energy (∆E(W)) were determined pre, during and post light intensity cycle ergometry. During exercise, despite a similar heart rate and blood pressure, patients had comparatively greater ∆E(W) (P=0.03) and trend towards greater AIx (P=0.07) than controls. Exercise ∆E(W) was greatest in patients with CF related diabetes (n=11). In all subjects, exercise ∆E(W) was related to age (r=0.54, P<0.001) and FEV(1)% predicted (r=-0.32, P=0.01). Adults with CF have an abnormal haemodynamic response to exercise. This finding has deleterious implications for myocardial performance.

Newer, faster, and more efficient delivery systems are being proposed. The purposes of this study was to compare the length of time it took to deliver the equivalent of normal saline nebulized for 10 min in a PARI LC STAR(®) nebulizer to that of an investigational PARI eFlow(®). Six normal adults inhaled a 4-mL (36-mg) charge volume of saline from the LC STAR(®) or a 2.5-mL (22.5-mg) charge volume from the investigational eFlow(®). The saline was mixed with (99m)Tc-DTPA to allow two-dimensional imaging. The inhalation was preceded by a xenon equilibration scan to allow more accurate separation of deposition into central and peripheral lung regions. The investigational eFlow(®) delivered 8.6 ± 1.0 mg, approximately 90% of the lung dose compared to the LC STAR(®), 9.6 ± 1.0 mg, but did in less than half the time (p < 0.02 for both). There were no differences in central versus peripheral distribution for either device. In conclusion the investigational eFlow(®) was both faster and more efficient than the LC STAR(®).

21398685	"Evolution of pulmonary inflammation and nutritional status in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis
"	"Improved nutrition is the major proven benefit of newborn screening programmes for cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with better clinical outcomes. It was hypothesised that early pulmonary inflammation and infection in infants with CF is associated with worse nutrition. Weight, height and pulmonary inflammation and infection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were assessed shortly after diagnosis in infants with CF and again at 1, 2 and 3 years of age. Body mass index (BMI) was expressed as z-scores. Inflammatory cells and cytokines (interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)), free neutrophil elastase activity and myeloperoxidase were measured in BAL. Mixed effects modelling was used to assess longitudinal associations between pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary infection (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and BMI z-score after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Forty-two infants were studied (16 (38%) male; 39 (93%) pancreatic insufficient); 36 were diagnosed by newborn screening (at median age 4 weeks) and six by early clinical diagnosis (meconium ileus). Thirty-one (74%) received antistaphylococcal antibiotics. More than two-thirds were asymptomatic at each assessment. Mean BMI z-scores were -1.5 at diagnosis and 0.5, -0.2 and -0.1 at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Neutrophil elastase and infection with S aureus were associated with lower BMI, whereas age (p=0.01) and antistaphylococcal antibiotics (p=0.013) were associated with increased BMI. On average, each log(10) increase in free neutrophil elastase activity was associated with a 0.43 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.79) reduction in BMI z-score. Early nutritional status is associated with the underlying pulmonary pathophysiology in CF, and better understanding of these relationships is required. Studies are required to assess whether interventions can decrease pulmonary inflammation and improve nutrition. Early surveillance will enable such targeted interventions with the aim of improving these important clinical outcomes.

"	"To investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)-induced supraphysiologic concentration of E2 on the endometrium and outcome of embryo implantation. Prospective experimental study. University-based laboratory. Imprinting control region female mice, 8-10 weeks old with regular estrous cycles. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at noon followed by an additional injection of 10 IU hCG 48 hours later. Uteri were collected from either superovulated or control mice (natural cycle) the morning after hCG administration on day 4 to evaluate and count blastocysts. A mouse blastocyst-endometrium coculture model was used to evaluate blastocyst adhesion to control or COH-treated endometrium. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression was determined by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and apoptosis determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay in both natural cycle and COH cycle endometrium. Primary culture of mouse endometrial epithelial cells was established to further determine the effects of various concentrations of E2 on apoptosis. We demonstrated that COH had adverse effects on blastocyst adhesion. In addition, COH endometrium exhibited an aberrant up-regulation of CFTR expression and a higher apoptotic rate compared with normal endometrium during the implantation period. Administration of exogenous supraphysiologic concentration of E2 to primary mouse endometrial epithelial cells mimicked the COH-induced up-regulation of CFTR and apoptosis observed in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of CFTR activity abrogated E2-induced apoptosis. The COH-induced supraphysiologic concentration of E2 aberrantly up-regulates CFTR, which leads to increased apoptosis in endometrial epithelial cells, resulting in impaired embryo implantation.

"	"High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a more sensitive tool for detecting early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease than either spirometry or plain radiography, but its relationship to other measures of lung function has not been established in young children. (1) To assess whether the lung clearance index (LCI) derived from multiple breath inert-gas washout (MBW) is as effective as HRCT in identifying pulmonary abnormalities; and (2) explore the relationships between abnormalities detected by HRCT and by spirometry, plethysmography and MBW (collectively, LFTs) in young children with CF. Children with CF underwent LFTs and volumetric HRCT on the same day. Healthy age-matched controls underwent identical LFTs without HRCT. Scans were anonymised, and scored using the Brody-II CT scoring system, to assess for presence and extent of bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening, mucus plugging, and parenchymal opacities. Assessments were undertaken in 60 children with CF (mean (SD) 7.8 (1.3 years) and 54 healthy controls (7.9 (1.2) y). Among children with CF, 84% (47/56) had abnormal LCI, 58% (27/47) abnormal plethysmographic lung volumes (FRC(pleth) or RV), 35% (21/60) abnormal sRaw and 47% (28/60) abnormal spirometry (FEV1 or FEF(25-75)); whereas HRCT scans were abnormal in 85% (51/60): median total Brody-II score: 9.5% (range 0-51%). Total CT score correlated more strongly with LCI (Spearman correlation = 0.77) than with spirometry (R = -0.43) or any other marker of lung function. Of the nine children with normal LCI, five had abnormalities on HRCT, whereas five children with normal HRCT had raised LCI. These results suggest that while LCI and HRCT have similar sensitivity to detect CF lung disease, complimentary information may be gained in individual patients.

However knowledge about the residual function of R117H-CFTR channels in cystic fibrosis-affected organs, e.g. airways, intestines and sweat glands is presently lacking. We evaluated clinical CF symptoms and assessed CFTR function by sweat tests, nasal potential difference and intestinal current measurements in 2 homozygous R117H individuals (7T variant). The CFTR activity in airways and intestine was within the normal range. However both individuals presented with a borderline sweat test and the male patient was infertile. The lack of impact of the R117H mutation on chloride secretion in intestine and nose contrasts with the ~80% loss of CFTR activity reported in patch clamp studies. Apparently CFTR activity is not rate-limiting for chloride secretion in both tissues at levels >20% of normal, or compensatory factors may operate that are absent in heterologous host cells in vitro.

To begin to address the organization and operation of the extensive cystic fibrosis protein network dictated by simultaneous and sequential interactions, it will be necessary to understand the global protein environment (the proteome) in which CFTR functions in the cell and the local network that dictates CFTR folding, trafficking, and function at the cell surface. Emerging mass spectrometry (MS) technologies and methodologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to fully characterize both the proteome and the protein interactions directing normal CFTR function and to define what goes wrong in disease. Below we provide the CF investigator with a general introduction to the capabilities of modern mass spectrometry technologies and methodologies with the goal of inspiring further application of these technologies for development of a basic understanding of the disease and for the identification of novel pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention in the clinic.

21779371	"PAD4-mediated neutrophil extracellular trap formation is not required for immunity against influenza infection
"	"During an inflammatory response, neutrophils migrate to the site of infection where they can kill invading pathogens by phagocytosis, secretion of anti-microbicidal mediators or the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are specialized anti-microbial structures comprised of decondensed chromatin decorated with microbicidal agents. Increased amount of NETs have been found in patients suffering from the chronic lung inflammatory disease cystic fibrosis, correlating with increased severity of pulmonary obstruction. Furthermore, acute lung inflammation during influenza A infection is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils into the lung. The role of NETs during virus-mediated lung inflammation is unknown. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated deimination of histone H3 and H4 is required for NET formation. Therefore, we generated a PAD4-deficient mouse strain that has a striking inability to form NETs. These mice were infected with influenza A/WSN, and the disease was monitored at the level of leukocytic lung infiltration, lung pathology, viral replication, weight loss and mortality. PAD4 KO fared comparable to WT mice in all the parameters tested, but they displayed slight but statistically different weight loss kinetics during infection that was not reflected in enhanced survival. Overall, we conclude that PAD4-mediated NET formation is dispensable in a mouse model of influenza A infection.

"	"The microbiome of the respiratory tract, including the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal microbiota, is a dynamic community of microorganisms that is highly diverse. The cystic fibrosis (CF) airway microbiome refers to the polymicrobial communities present in the lower airways of CF patients. It is comprised of chronic opportunistic pathogens (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a variety of organisms derived mostly from the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract. The complexity of these communities has been inferred primarily from culture independent molecular profiling. As with most microbial communities it is generally assumed that most of the organisms present are not readily cultured. Our culture collection generated using more extensive cultivation approaches, reveals a more complex microbial community than that obtained by conventional CF culture methods. To directly evaluate the cultivability of the airway microbiome, we examined six samples in depth using culture-enriched molecular profiling which combines culture-based methods with the molecular profiling methods of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We demonstrate that combining culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches enhances the sensitivity of either approach alone. Our techniques were able to cultivate 43 of the 48 families detected by deep sequencing; the five families recovered solely by culture-independent approaches were all present at very low abundance (<0.002% total reads). 46% of the molecular signatures detected by culture from the six patients were only identified in an anaerobic environment, suggesting that a large proportion of the cultured airway community is composed of obligate anaerobes. Most significantly, using 20 growth conditions per specimen, half of which included anaerobic cultivation and extended incubation times we demonstrate that the majority of bacteria present can be cultured.

Study goals were to compare molecular detection of viruses from concurrent upper airway and sputum samples in children with CF and to describe relative frequency of respiratory viral infections and identify potential clinical associations. We conducted a 2-year prospective surveillance study in 44 children with CF aged 6-18 years. Upper airway and sputum samples were collected quarterly and during pulmonary exacerbations and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses types 1-4, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. Physical exams and symptom surveys were used to identify respiratory signs and symptoms. Upper airway samples were collected at 359 visits; concordance of PCR-based viral detection was examined in a subset of paired upper airway and sputum samples from 21 participants at 92 visits. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus (23·1% overall), and rhinovirus detection was the same for both sample types (21·7% each). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of rhinovirus in sputum relative to upper airway sampling were 70% and 91·7%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms associated with rhinovirus detection included increased cough, increased nasal congestion, increased sputum production, and wheezing. A relatively high frequency of rhinovirus detection was observed by either upper airway or sputum samples, and clinical findings suggest a significant-associated symptom burden.

These results were confirmed by further studies, which showed that the PNAG hydrolase, dispersin B, eliminated immunoreactivity of extracts from the species that were tested (B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans). Dispersin B also inhibited biofilm formation and dispersed preformed biofilms of Burkholderia species. These results imply a role for PNAG in the maintenance of Burkholderia biofilm integrity. While PNAG was present in biofilms of all of the wild-type test organisms, a ΔpgaBC mutant of B. multivorans (Mu5) produced no detectable PNAG, indicating that these genes are needed for Burkholderia PNAG formation. Furthermore, restoration of PNAG production in PNAG negative E. coli TRXWMGΔC (ΔpgaC) by complementation with B. multivorans pgaBCD confirmed the involvement of these genes in Burkholderia PNAG production. While the confocal scanning laser microscopy of untreated wild-type B. multivorans showed thick, multilayered biofilm, Mu5 and dispersin B-treated wild-type biofilms were thin, poorly developed, and disrupted, confirming the involvement of PNAG in B. multivorans biofilm formation. Thus, PNAG appears to be an important component of Burkholderia biofilms, potentially contributing to its resistance to multiple antibiotics and persistence during chronic infections, including cystic fibrosis-associated infection.

Semi-structured interviews with 24 young adults after transfer (aged 15-22 years; diagnosed with haemophilia, diabetes mellitus, spina bifida, congenital heart disorders, cystic fibrosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or sickle cell disease), 24 parents and 17 healthcare providers. Thematic analysis was performed. Only the haemophilia department offered a structured transition programme, most patients had not been prepared for transition. Experiences and views of patients, parents and professionals mainly overlapped and were condensed into four core themes. Two are related to moving to adult care: (1) 'leaving paediatric care is a logical step'. Leaving familiar surroundings was harder for parents than for young adults who displayed a positive 'wait-and-see' attitude; and (2) 'transition is complicated by cultural gaps between paediatric and adult services'. Young adults and parents felt lost after transfer and recommended their peers 'to be alert and involved'. Providers also recognized the cultural chasm between both services and worried about non-compliance, lost to follow-up and lack of independence. Two other themes indicated priorities for improvement: (3) 'better patient and parent preparation' for differences between healthcare settings and for new roles and responsibilities with respect to self-management; and (4) 'more collaboration and personal links' between paediatric and adult care providers. Action is required to cross the chasm between paediatric and adult-oriented care. Preparation for transition should start early and focus on strengthening adolescents' independency without undermining parental involvement. Building bridges between services, gaining trust and investing in new personal relations is a challenge for all parties involved: transition is about responding and bonding.

Age related changes regarding the course of disease and susceptibility towards pulmonary infections have been discussed in numerous studies. Here, we investigated CftrTgH(neoim)Hgu and Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J CF mice and their non-CF littermates during an acute lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for age dependent effects of their lung function and immune response.Mice younger than three or older than six months were intratracheally infected with P. aeruginosa TBCF10839. The infection was monitored by lung function of the animals using non-invasive head-out spirometry and the time course of physiological parameters over 192 hours. Quantitative bacteriology and lung histopathology of a subgroup of animals were used as endpoint parameters. Age-dependent changes in lung function and characteristic features for CF like a shallower, faster breathing pattern were observed in both CF mouse models in uninfected state. In contrast infected CF mice did not significantly differ from their non-CF littermates in susceptibility and severity of lung infection in both mouse models and age groups. The transgenic Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J and their non-CF littermates showed a milder course of infection than the CftrTgH(neoim)Hgu CF and their congenic C57Bl/6J non-CF mice suggesting that the genetic background was more important for outcome than Cftr dysfunction. Previous investigations of the same mouse lines have shown a higher airway susceptibility of older CF mice to intranasally applied P. aeruginosa. The different outcome of intranasal and intratracheal instillation of bacteria implies that infected CF epithelium is impaired during the initial colonization of upper airways, but not in the subsequent response of host defense.

The present study aimed to define the role of the lectin pathway of complement in the immune-defence against P. aeruginosa in a mouse model of invasive pneumonia. Using in vitro assays specific for each of the three complement pathways, we demonstrate that some strains of P. aeruginosa bind lectin pathway recognition sub-components and initiate complement activation in a lectin pathway-specific mode. All of the tested strains activated complement via classical and alternative pathways. We assessed the importance of lectin pathway activation in fighting P. aeruginosa infections by testing a lectin pathway activating strain in a mouse model of intra-nasal infection. MASP-2 (mannan binding lectin associated serine protease-2) deficient mice, which have no lectin pathway activity, had no significant survival disadvantage compared to wild type littermates (72.7% and 81.8% survival, respectively, p=0.48). Likewise, no difference in opsonising activity was seen between MASP-2 sufficient and MASP-2 deficient mouse sera. Moreover, cytokine expression profiles in the lungs of WT mice and MASP-2-/- mice were similar throughout the course of P. aeruginosa infection. We conclude that the lectin pathway does not play an essential role in fighting P. aeruginosa infection in mice.

We conducted an international, quasi-experimental survey of researchers involved in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) genetics to explore perceived obligations to ensure updated information or relevant clinical care subsequent to any initial communication of research results, and factors influencing these attitudes. 5-point Likert scales of dis/agreement were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate statistics. Of the 343 respondents (44% response rate), large majorities agreed that in general and in a variety of hypothetical research contexts, research teams that report results should ensure that participants gain subsequent access to updated information (74-83%) and implicated clinical services (79-87%). At the same time, researchers perceived barriers restricting access to relevant clinical care, though this was significantly more pronounced (P<0.001) for ASD (64%) than CF (34%). In the multivariate model, endorsement of cascading obligations was positively associated with researcher characteristics (eg, clinical role/training) and attitudes (eg, perceived initial reporting obligation), and negatively associated with the initial report of less scientifically robust hypothetical results, but unaffected by perceived or hypothetical barriers to care. These results suggest that researchers strongly endorse information and care-based obligations that cascade from the initial report of research results to study participants.

22554673	"Tacrolimus and cyclosporine have differential effects on the risk of development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome: results of a prospective, randomized international trial in lung transplantation
"	"Chronic lung allograft dysfunction, which manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is recognized as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. In this study we assessed the efficacy and safety of two de novo immunosuppression protocols to prevent BOS. Our study approach was a multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1) open-label superiority investigation of de novo tacrolimus vs cyclosporine, with both study arms given mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone after lung transplantation. Cytolytic induction therapy was not employed. Patients were stratified at entry for cystic fibrosis. Primary outcome was incidence of BOS 3 years after transplant (intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary outcomes were survival and incidence of acute rejection, infection and other adverse events. Group demographic data were well matched: 110 of 124 tacrolimus vs 74 of 125 cyclosporine patients were treated per protocol (p < 0.01 by chi-square test). Cumulative incidence of BOS Grade ≥1 at 3 years was 11.6% (tacrolimus) vs 21.3% (cyclosporine) (cumulative incidence curves, p = 0.037 by Gray's test, pooled over strata). Univariate proportional sub-distribution hazards regression confirmed cyclosporine as a risk for BOS (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.77, p = 0.039). Three-year cumulative incidence of acute rejection was 67.4% (tacrolimus) vs 74.9% (cyclosporine) (p = 0.118 by Gray's test). One- and 3-year survival rates were 84.6% and 78.7% (tacrolimus) vs 88.6% and 82.8% (cyclosporine) (p = 0.382 by log-rank test). Cumulative infection rates were similar (p = 0.91), but there was a trend toward new-onset renal failure with tacrolimus (p = 0.09). Compared with cyclosporine, de novo tacrolimus use was found to be associated with a significantly reduced risk for BOS Grade ≥1 at 3 years despite a similar rate of acute rejection. However, no survival advantage was detected.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) mouse models exhibit exocrine pancreatic function, yet they do not develop adipose stores to the levels of non-CF mice. CF mice homozygous for the Cftr mutation (F508del) at 3 wk (postweaning) and 6 wk (young adult) of age had markedly less adipose tissue than non-CF mice. Food intake was markedly lower in 3-wk-old CF mice but normalized by 6 wk of age. Both 3- and 6-wk-old mice had dietary lipid absorption and fecal lipid excretion comparable to non-CF mice. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), determined by (2)H incorporation, was reduced in CF mice. At 3 wk, F508del mice had significantly decreased DNL of palmitate and stearate, by 83% and 80%, respectively. By 6 wk, DNL rates in non-CF mice remained unchanged compared with 3-wk-old mice, while DNL rates of F508del mice were still reduced, by 33% and 40%, respectively. Adipose tissue fatty acid (FA) profiles were comparable in CF and non-CF mice, indicating that adipose differences are quantitative, not qualitative. A correspondingly lower content of (2)H-labeled FA was found in CF adipose tissue, consistent with reduced deposition of newly made hepatic triglycerides and/or decreased adipose tissue lipogenesis. Hepatic transcriptome analysis revealed lower mRNA expression from several genes involved in FA biosynthesis, suggesting downregulation of this pathway as a mechanism for the reduced lipogenesis. These novel data provide a model for altered lipid metabolism in CF, independent of malabsorption, and may partly explain the inability of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to completely restore normal body mass to CF patients.

Existing measures of disturbed EABs can have different meanings in this population and do not assess CF-related EABs. A self-report measure of EABs in CF was developed to highlight areas of eating disturbance. The content validity of a draft measure was evaluated via expert evaluation and literature review and an amended measure piloted with 8 CF patients using cognitive interviewing. A further amended measure was administered to 155 CF patients (11-62 years) attending CF clinics. Principal components analyses revealed a three-factor structure ('Desire for thinness and weight loss', 'Disturbed EABs', and 'Appetite') with good internal consistencies for subscales and the 21-item whole measure. The measure looks promising as a tool to highlight EAB disturbance in CF. Further work will establish its construct validity and clarify interpretation of subscales.

Our aim was to determine the frequency of fungi in the respiratory tract of Turkish CF patients. We investigated a total of 184 samples from 48 patients. Samples were inoculated on Medium B+ and CHROMagar Candida. Candida albicans was the predominant yeast isolated [30 patients (62.5%)], followed by C. parapsilosis [6 (12.5%)] and C. dubliniensis 5 (10.4%). Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common filamentous fungus [5 (10.4%)] and non-fumigatus Aspergillus species were isolated from four (8.3%) patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected bacterium in C. albicans positive samples (53.57%). A. fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. aureus were detected together in 75% of A. fumigatus positive samples each. No statistically significant relationship was detected between growth of yeast and moulds and age, gender, the use of inhaled corticosteroids or tobramycin. No significant correlation was found between the isolation of C. albicans, A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia or S. aureus, and the isolation of C. albicans and Haemophilus influenzae. Other factors which may be responsible for the increased isolation of fungi in CF need to be investigated.

"	"Goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) and mucous hypersecretion are common pathological features of chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis. Despite numerous studies, the molecular basis for this condition remains elusive. Gab2 is a member of the Dos/Gab subfamily scaffolding molecules and plays important roles in regulating growth, differentiation, and inflammation. We found that an elevated level of Gab2 correlates with up-regulated mucus in airway epithelia from patients with lung cancer or COPD, suggesting the potential involvement of Gab2 in pathological lesions in lungs. Knockdown of Gab2 in human airway epithelial cells in vitro decreases IL-13-induced expression of mucin genes. To address the in vivo role of Gab2 in lungs, Gab2-knockout (Gab2(-/-)) mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Further analysis of lungs in an OVA-induced allergy model suggested that GCH and mucus production are remarkably reduced in Gab2(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, Gab2 positively regulates IL-13-induced activation of TYK2/STAT6 by decreasing SOCS3-mediated degradation of TYK2. Together, we define a novel role for Gab2 in mediating mucin gene expression and GCH; these findings have important implications for the pathogenesis and therapy of airway inflammatory diseases.

"	"Neutrophils sequestered in lower respiratory tract secretions in the inflamed lung may undergo apoptosis and/or necrosis and release toxic cellular contents that can injure airways or parenchyma. This study examined the viability of neutrophils retrieved from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis. Integrity and stability of intracellular proteins in neutrophils from proximal airways and peripheral blood from lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis were analyzed via Western blot analysis and determination of neutrophil viability by morphologic appearance and flow cytometry. Neutrophils in tracheobronchial secretions from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis who had normal chest radiographic imaging but bronchoscopic evidence of purulent tracheobronchitis post-transplant were necrotic and associated with degradation of intracellular protein annexin 1. The neutrophil influx was compartmentalized to large airways and not detected in peripheral bronchoalveolar airspaces sampled via bronchoalveolar lavage. Peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects cultured in vitro demonstrated that annexin 1 degradation, particularly to a 33 kDa annexin 1 breakdown product (A1-BP), was associated with neutrophil necrosis, but not apoptosis. Although annexin 1 degradation was not specific to neutrophil necrosis, it was a sensitive marker of intracellular protein degradation associated with neutrophil necrosis. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 kDa A1-BP was not observed in peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects, but annexin 1 appeared to be degraded in peripheral blood neutrophils of lung transplant recipients despite a normal morphologic appearance of these cells. Neutrophils were necrotic from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis, and this process may begin when neutrophils are still in the systemic circulation prior to sequestration in inflamed airways. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 kDa A1-BP may be useful as a sensitive marker to detect neutrophil necrosis.

"	"Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e. g. chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.

"	"Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is often observed in patients with pancreatic diseases, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and tumors, or after surgical resection. PEI often results in malnutrition, weight loss and steatorrhea, which together increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, nutritional interventions, such as low-fat diets and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), are needed to improve the clinical symptoms, and to address the pathophysiology of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. PERT with delayed-release pancrelipase is now becoming a standard therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency because it significantly improves the coefficients of fat and nitrogen absorption as well as clinical symptoms, without serious treatment-emergent adverse events. The major adverse events were tolerable gastrointestinal tract symptoms, such as stomach pain, nausea, and bloating. Fibrosing colonopathy, a serious complication, is associated with high doses of enzymes. Several pancrelipase products have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in recent years. Although many double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pancrelipase products have been conducted in recent years, these studies have enrolled relatively few patients and have often been less than a few weeks in duration. Moreover, few studies have addressed the issue of pancreatic diabetes, a type of diabetes that is characterized by frequent hypoglycemia, which is difficult to manage. In addition, it is unclear whether PERT improves morbidity and mortality in such settings. Therefore, large, long-term prospective studies are needed to identify the optimal treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The studies should also examine the extent to which PERT using pancrelipase improves mortality and morbidity. The etiology and severity of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency often differ among patients with gastrointestinal diseases or diabetes (type 1 and type 2), and among elderly subjects. Finally, although there is currently limited clinical evidence, numerous extrapancreatic diseases and conditions that are highly prevalent in the general population may also be considered potential targets for PERT and related treatments.

"	"Antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCA) directed against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) are common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and serum levels are correlated with lung colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the severity of lung damage. The production of BPI-ANCA may be due to the costimulation of BPI when mounting an immune response against P. aeruginosa. The effect of surgery aiming to eradicate bacteria and infected tissue on BPI-ANCA levels is sparsely described. A cohort of patients with CF were included: 53 patients having extensive image-guided sinus surgery (EIGSS) with topical postoperative antibiotic treatment, 131 non-operated controls and 36 who had double lung transplantation (LTX). In all 219 patients, serum samples before and after surgery or at similar intervals were analysed for IgG and IgA BPI-ANCA. The EIGSS group showed a highly significant decrease in both IgA and IgG BPI-ANCA levels compared with their own preoperative values and control group values (P < 0.001-0.02). The LTX patients also showed a highly significant decrease in both IgA and IgG BPI-ANCA levels (P < 0.001). EIGSS and LTX decrease IgA and IgG BPI-ANCA levels in patients with CF, indicating that extensive removal of infected tissue influences the pathogenic process of autoantibody production. The results shown herein are in favour of applying EIGSS in selected patients with CF and for using BPI-ANCA as a surrogate marker for guiding further therapeutic interventions.

23060444	"Regulation of activation and processing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by a complex electrostatic interaction between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.
"	"NEG2 regulates CFTR gating but the mechanism is unknown. A putative NEG2-CL3 electrostatic attraction, possibly weakened by Arg-764/Arg-766 of the R domain, prohibited CFTR activation. A charge exchange between NEG2 and CL3 caused misprocessing. Electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing may be asymmetric at the CL3-R interface. The CL3-R interface is optimally designed for multiple regulations of CFTR functions. NEG2, a short C-terminal segment (817-838) of the unique regulatory (R) domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, has been reported to regulate CFTR gating in response to cAMP-dependent R domain phosphorylation. The underlying mechanism, however, is unclear. Here, Lys-946 of cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3) is proposed as counter-ion of Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 of NEG2 to prevent the channel activation by PKA. Arg-764 or Arg-766 of the Ser-768 phosphorylation site of the R domain is proposed to promote the channel activation possibly by weakening the putative CL3-NEG2 electrostatic attraction. First, not only D835A, D836A, and E838A but also K946A reduced the PKA-dependent CFTR activation. Second, both K946D and D835R/D836R/E838R mutants were activated by ATP and curcumin to a different extent. Third, R764A and R766A mutants enhanced the PKA-dependent activation. However, it is very exciting that D835R/D836R/E838R and K946D/H950D and H950R exhibited normal channel processing and activity whereas D835R/D836R/E838R/K946D/H950D was fractionally misprocessed and silent in response to forskolin. Further, D836R and E838R played a critical role in the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR processing, and Ser-768 phosphorylation may not be involved. Thus, a complex interfacial interaction among CL3, NEG2, and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may be responsible for the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing.

23090599	"Persister cells: molecular mechanisms related to antibiotic tolerance
"	"It is a given that new antibiotics are needed to combat drug-resistant pathogens. However, this is only a part of the need-we actually never had antibiotics capable of eradicating an infection. All pathogens produce a small subpopulation of dormant persister cells that are highly tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Once an antibiotic concentration drops, surviving persisters re-establish the population, causing a relapsing chronic infection. Persisters are especially significant when the pathogen is shielded from the immune system by biofilms, or in sites where the immune components are limited-in the nervous system, the stomach, or inside macrophages.Antibiotic treatment during a prolonged chronic infection of P. aeruginosa in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis selects for high-persister (hip) mutants. Similarly, treatment of oral thrush infection selects for hip mutants of C. albicans. These observations suggest a direct causality between persisters and recalcitrance of the disease. It appears that tolerance of persisters plays a leading role in chronic infections, while resistance is the leading cause of recalcitrance to therapy in acute infections. Studies of persister formation in E. coli show that mechanisms of dormancy are highly redundant. Isolation of persisters produced a transcriptome which suggests a dormant phenotype characterized by downregulation of energy-producing and biosynthetic functions. Toxin-antitoxin modules represent a major mechanism of persister formation. The RelE toxin causes dormancy by cleaving mRNA; the HipA toxin inhibits translation by phosphorylating elongation factor Ef-Tu, and the TisB toxin forms a membrane pore, leading to a decrease in pmf and ATP.

To investigate whether there is a correlation between radiological pulmonary lesions and relevant BPD clinical data (gestational age, type and duration of mechanical ventilation, and severity of BPD) and assess the usefulness of a CT score in evaluating clinical severity. Retrospective study of 19 premature infants with BPD born between 1998 and 2007 who underwent at least one chest CT during their first year of life. A total of 29 CT were blindly evaluated by two radiologists for the presence or absence of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities described in BPD (areas of decreased attenuation, presence of bullae/emphysema, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, linear, and subpleural opacities). This score was then compared with the most relevant clinical data. All CT scans showed abnormalities. The most frequent lesion was bronchial wall thickening observed in all patients, followed by linear (89.5%) and subpleural (89.5%) opacities. Areas of decreased attenuation were found in 68.4%. Bullae/emphysema and bronchiectasis were the less frequent item described (26.3% and 21.1%, respectively). The presence of areas of decreased attenuation significantly correlated with BPD severity (P = 0.03). However, there was no significant correlation between the CT score and clinical data. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of chest CT score to assess the severity of BPD. Areas of decreased attenuation seem the most sensitive item to predict BPD severity. More patients are needed to validate this approach and to evaluate the long-term usefulness of CT scan.

Correct assessment of cystic-fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD) in clinical routine is a challenging issue. Sonographic elastography based on acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) is a new noninvasive approach for quantitatively assessing in vivo elasticity of biological tissues in many organs. To characterize ARFI elastography as a diagnostic tool to assess alteration of liver tissue elasticity related to cystic fibrosis in children. ARFI elastography and B-mode US imaging were performed in 36 children with cystic fibrosis. The children's clinical history and laboratory parameters were documented. According to the findings on conventional US, children were assigned to distinct groups indicating severity of hepatic tissue alterations. The relationship between US findings and respective elastography values was assessed. Additionally, differences between ARFI elastography values of each US group were statistically tested. Children with sonomorphologic characteristics of fibrotic tissue remodeling presented significantly increased values for tissue elasticity. Children with normal B-mode US or discrete signs of hepatic tissue alterations showed a tendency toward increased tissue stiffness indicating early tissue remodeling. Assessment of children with CFLD by means of ARFI elastography yields adequate results when compared to conventional US. For detection of early stages of liver disease with mild fibrotic reactions of hepatic tissue, ARFI elastography might offer diagnostic advantages over conventional US. Thus, liver stiffness measured by means of elastography might represent a valuable biological parameter for evaluation and follow-up of CFLD.

Leading textbooks do not mention JIA as a possible presenting clinical feature of CF. We describe two cases of JIA with a delayed diagnosis of CF (4 months [post mortem] and 19 months). This led to a retrospective review of all patients with JIA in our hospital. We hypothesised that also in the past although indicated further testing for CF had not always been performed. Over an 18-year period from January 1991 until December 2008, all cases of JIA in our centre were reviewed (n=50). We compared patients who have been tested for CF (n=18) with patients who have not been tested for CF (n=32), with respect to their patient characteristics, either by logistic regression analysis or a nonparametric test (p<0.05). Of all 50 patients the proportion of infants actually tested for CF was 18 (36%). A statistical significant difference between the group of patients who were tested for CF versus the group of those who were not tested was found in a higher occurrence of postoperative bilious retention after 7 days (56% versus 25%, respectively), and postoperative complications (78% versus 34%, respectively). CF was confirmed in 4 (8%). Testing for CF in newborns presenting with JIA does not appear to be common practice. A timely diagnosis of CF leads to presymptomatic treatment and has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality. CF should be tested for in all children with JIA. We recommend a sweat test for term children and CFTR DNA testing as a first step for preterm infants. Medical professional awareness may be increased if future editions of leading text books in the relevant fields should include JIA as an indication to follow an appropriate CF-diagnostic algorithm.

"	"The PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1) domain-based interactions play important roles in regulating the expression and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several PDZ domain-containing proteins (PDZ proteins for short) have been identified as directly or indirectly interacting with the C terminus of CFTR. To better understand the regulation of CFTR processing, we conducted a genetic screen and identified MAST205 (a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 205 kDa) as a new CFTR regulator. We found that overexpression of MAST205 increased the expression of CFTR and augmented CFTR-mediated fluid transport in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of MAST205 inhibited CFTR function. The PDZ motif of CFTR is required for the regulatory role of MAST205 in CFTR expression and function. We further demonstrated that MAST205 and the CFTR-associated ligand competed for binding to CFTR, which facilitated the processing of CFTR and consequently up-regulated the expression and function of CFTR at the plasma membrane. More importantly, we found that MAST205 could facilitate the processing of F508del-CFTR mutant and augment its quantity and channel function at the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data suggest that MAST205 plays an important role in regulating CFTR expression and function. Our findings have important clinical implications for treating CFTR-associated diseases such as cystic fibrosis and secretory diarrheas.

Twice-daily erythromycin ethylsuccinate (400 mg) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was the annualized mean rate of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations (PDPEs) per patient. Secondary outcomes included macrolide resistance in commensal oropharyngeal streptococci and lung function. Six-hundred seventy-nine patients were screened, 117 were randomized (58 placebo, 59 erythromycin), and 107 (91.5%) completed the study. Erythromycin significantly reduced PDPEs both overall (mean, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.93-1.65] vs 1.97 [95% CI, 1.45-2.48] per patient per year; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42-0.77]; P = .003), and in the prespecified subgroup with baseline Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection (mean difference, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.19-2.46]; P = .02). Erythromycin reduced 24-hour sputum production (median difference, 4.3 g [interquartile range [IQR], 1 to 7.8], P = .01) and attenuated lung function decline (mean absolute difference for change in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration, 2.2 percent predicted [95% CI, 0.1% to 4.3%]; P = .04) compared with placebo. Erythromycin increased the proportion of macrolide-resistant oropharyngeal streptococci (median change, 27.7% [IQR, 0.04% to 41.1%] vs 0.04% [IQR, -1.6% to 1.5%]; difference, 25.5% [IQR,15.0% to 33.7%]; P < .001). Among patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, the 12-month use of erythromycin compared with placebo resulted in a modest decrease in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and an increased rate of macrolide resistance. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609000578202.

23636454	"RACK1 interacts with filamin-A to regulate plasma membrane levels of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
"	"Mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel in the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, underlie the fatal genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. Certain CFTR mutations, including the common mutation ΔF508-CFTR, result in greatly decreased levels of active CFTR at the apical membrane. Direct interactions between CFTR and the cytoskeletal adaptors filamin-A (FlnA) and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) stabilize the expression and localization of CFTR at the plasma membrane. The scaffold protein receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) also stabilizes CFTR surface expression; however, RACK1 does not interact directly with CFTR and its mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we report that RACK1 interacts directly with FlnA in vitro and in a Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line. We mapped the interaction between RACK1 and FlnA to the WD4 and WD6 repeats of RACK1 and to a segment of the large rod domain of FlnA, consisting of immunoglobulin-like repeats 8-15. Disruption of the RACK1-FlnA interaction causes a reduction in CFTR surface levels. Our results suggest that a novel RACK1-FlnA interaction is an important regulator of CFTR surface localization.

"	"To report a case of esophageal cancer in an adult patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and review the relationship between these 2 diseases. A 40-year-old man with CF presented with worsening epigastric pain, weight loss, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Endoscopy revealed innumerable masses in the distal esophagus. The workup revealed esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver and the lungs. Abnormal mucous secretions in CF patients impair the innate GI mucosal barriers. The incidence of both gastroesophageal reflux disease and GI malignancies is higher in patients with CF. Patients with CF now survive long enough to potentially experience the consequences of long-term acid exposure, including esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal cancer. Our case report adds to a small but growing body of evidence that CF is a significant risk factor for GI malignancies, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. Controlled studies are needed to determine whether a causal relationship truly exists.

23815177	"High expression of midkine in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis
"	"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in impaired host defense during cystic fibrosis (CF), where Pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes a key pathogen. We investigated the expression pattern of the antibacterial growth factor midkine (MK) in CF and the possible interference with its activity by the altered airway microenvironment. High MK expression was found in CF lung tissue compared with control samples, involving epithelia of the large and small airways, alveoli, and cells of the submucosa (i.e., neutrophils and mast cells). In CF sputum, MK was present at 100-fold higher levels, but was also subject to increased degradation, compared with MK in sputum from healthy control subjects. MK exerted a bactericidal effect on P. aeruginosa, but increasing salt concentrations and low pH impaired this activity. Molecular modeling suggested that the effects of salt and pH were attributable to electrostatic screening and a charge-neutralization of the membrane, respectively. Both the neutrophil elastase and elastase of P. aeruginosa cleaved MK to smaller fragments, resulting in impaired bactericidal activity. Thus, MK is highly expressed in CF, but its bactericidal properties may be impaired by the altered microenvironment, as reflected by the in vitro conditions used in this study.

"	"S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous nitrosothiol involved in several pathophysiological processes. A role for GSNO has been envisaged in the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8; however, conflicting results have been reported. γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) enzyme activity can hydrolyze the γ-glutamyl bond present in the GSNO molecule thus greatly accelerating the release of bioactive nitric oxide. Expression of GGT is induced by oxidative stress, and activated neutrophils contribute to GGT increase in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung exudates by releasing GGT-containing microvesicles. This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of GSNO catabolism mediated by GGT on production of IL-8 in CF transmembrane regulation protein-mutated IB3-1 bronchial cells. The rapid, GGT-catalyzed catabolism of GSNO caused a decrease in both basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-8 production in IB3-1 cells, by modulating both NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways, along with a decrease in cell proliferation. In contrast, a slow decomposition of GSNO produced a significant increase in both cell proliferation and expression of IL-8, the latter possibly through p38-mediated stabilization of IL-8 mRNA. Our data suggest that the differential GSNO catabolism mediated by GGT enzyme activity can downregulate the production of IL-8 in CF cells. Hence, the role of GGT activity should be considered when evaluating GSNO for both in vitro and in vivo studies, the more so in the case of GSNO-based therapies for cystic fibrosis.

"	"Almost half of individuals who have cystic fibrosis (CF) are over 18 years old, thus safely transferring patients from pediatric to adult care is a priority. The purpose of this study is to compare youth transferred from pediatric to adult CF care versus those remaining in pediatric CF care and quantify the relationship between transfer status and health outcomes. Patients who transferred from pediatric to adult CF care were identified from the CF Foundation Patient Registry from 1997 to 2007. Transferred patients were compared with individuals who have similar baseline characteristics who remained in pediatric care throughout the same time period. The main outcome measures include pulmonary function, nutritional status, care use, and home intravenous antibiotic events per year. A propensity-matched analysis was performed. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in pediatric programs throughout the study period. The mean age at transfer to adult care was 21.2 (1.3) years. In the 2 years after transfer there was a less rapid decline in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 0.78 percentage points per year among transfer-positive patients compared with transfer-negative ones (95% confidence interval; 0.06-1.51); there were no other significant health related changes. The current study contradicts reports of other chronic childhood conditions, in which transfer between the pediatric and adult health system was associated with adverse health outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the long-term relationship between transition practices and health status outcomes to establish a systematic, evidence-based transition process.

24209388	"α1-Antitrypsin promotes SPLUNC1-mediated lung defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice
"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection is involved in various lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, treatment of PA infection is not very effective in part due to antibiotic resistance. α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) has been shown to reduce PA infection in humans and animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The goal of our study is to test whether a novel endogenous host defense protein, short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1), is involved in the therapeutic effect of A1AT during lung PA infection. SPLUNC1 knockout (KO) and littermate wild-type (WT) mice on the C57BL/6 background were intranasally infected with PA to determine the therapeutic effects of A1AT. A1AT was aerosolized to mice 2 hrs after the PA infection, and mice were sacrificed 24 hrs later. PA load and inflammation were quantified in the lung, and SPLUNC1 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was examined by Western blot. In WT mice, PA infection significantly increased neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, but reduced SPLUNC1 protein in BAL fluid. Notably, PA-infected mice treated with A1AT versus bovine serum albumin (BSA) demonstrated higher levels of SPLUNC1 protein expression, which are accompanied by lower levels of NE activity, lung bacterial load, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. To determine whether A1AT therapeutic effects are dependent on SPLUNC1, lung PA load in A1AT- or BSA-treated SPLUNC1 KO mice was examined. Unlike the WT mice, A1AT treatment in SPLUNC1 KO mice had no significant impact on lung PA load and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. A1AT reduces lung bacterial infection in mice in part by preventing NE-mediated SPLUNC1 degradation.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease begins in early life and is progressive with the major risk factor being an exaggerated inflammatory response. Currently, assessment of neutrophilic inflammation in early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease relies on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is raised in sputum and serum of adults with CF. We investigated YKL-40 in BAL, serum and urine to determine whether this reflected inflammation and infection in young children with CF. YKL-40 was measured in matched samples of BAL, serum and urine obtained from 36 infants and young children with CF participating in an early surveillance program. Levels were compared to clinical data and markers of inflammation detected in the lung. YKL-40 in BAL correlated with pulmonary infection [β=1.30 (SE 0.34), p < 0.001] and BAL markers of inflammation [macrophage number: r2 = 0.34, p < 0.001; neutrophil number: r2 = 0.74, p < 0.001; neutrophil elastase: r2 = 0.47, p < 0.001; CXCL8: r2 = 0.45, p < 0.001; IL-β: r2 = 0.62, p < 0.001]. YKL-40 was detectable in serum but levels did not correlate with BAL levels in the same individuals (r2 = 0.04, p = 0.14) or with inflammatory markers. YKL-40 was below the limit of detection in urine (30 pg/ml). This study demonstrates that levels of the chitinase-like protein YKL-40 reflect airway inflammation and infection in early CF lung disease. The lack of increased YKL-40 in serum in the absence of systemic inflammation limits the benefit of this potential biomarker in early disease.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by dysfunction of the epithelial anion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One strategy to restore function to CF mutants is to suppress defects in CFTR processing and function using revertant mutations. Here, we investigate the effects of the revertant mutations G550E and 4RK (the simultaneous disruption of four arginine-framed tripeptides (AFTs): R29K, R516K, R555K and R766K) on the CF mutant G551D, which impairs severely channel gating without altering protein processing and which affects a residue in the same α-helix as G550 and R555. Both G550E and 4RK augmented strongly CFTR-mediated iodide efflux from BHK cells expressing G551D-CFTR. To learn how revertant mutations influence G551D-CFTR function, we studied protein processing and single-channel behaviour. Neither G550E nor 4RK altered the expression and maturation of G551D-CFTR protein. By contrast, both revertants had marked effects on G551D-CFTR channel gating, increasing strongly opening frequency, while 4RK also diminished noticeably the duration of channel openings. Because G551D-CFTR channel gating is ATP independent, we investigated whether revertant mutations restore ATP dependence to G551D-CFTR. Like wild-type CFTR, the activity of 4RK-G551D-CFTR varied with ATP concentration, suggesting that 4RK confers some ATP dependence on the G551D-CFTR channel. Thus, the revertant mutations G550E and 4RK alter the gating pattern and ATP dependence of G551D-CFTR without restoring single-channel activity to wild-type levels. Based on their impact on the CF mutants F508del and G551D, we conclude that G550E and 4RK have direct effects on CFTR structure, but that their action on CFTR processing and channel function is CF mutation specific.

Between 2002 and 2013, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) designed, tested and modified the LLC to guide front line staff efforts in these efforts. This paper describes the CFF LLC evolution and essential elements that have facilitated increased improvement capability of CF centres and improved CF outcomes. CF centre improvement teams across the USA have participated in 11 LLCs of 12 months' duration since 2002. Based on the Dartmouth Microsystem Improvement Curriculum, the original LLC included face to face meetings, an email listserv, conference calls and completion of between learning session task books. The LLCs evolved over time to include internet based learning, an electronic repository of improvement resources and examples, change ideas driven by evidence based clinical practice guidelines, benchmarking site visits, an applied QI measurement curriculum and team coaching. Over 90% of the CF centres in the USA have participated in the LLCs and have increased their improvement capabilities. Ten essential elements were identified as contributors to the successful LLCs: LLC national leadership and coordination, local leadership, people with CF and families involvement, registry data transparency, standardised improvement curriculum with evidence based change ideas, internet resources with reminders, team coaching, regular progress reporting and tracking, benchmarking site visits and applied improvement measurement. The LLCs have contributed to improved medical and process outcomes over the past 10 years. Ten essential elements of the LLCs may benefit improvement efforts in other chronic care populations and health systems.

"	"Animal models for cystic fibrosis (CF) have contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Here we describe development and characterization of the first cystic fibrosis rat, in which the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) was knocked out using a pair of zinc finger endonucleases (ZFN). The disrupted Cftr gene carries a 16 base pair deletion in exon 3, resulting in loss of CFTR protein expression. Breeding of heterozygous (CFTR+/-) rats resulted in Mendelian distribution of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous (CFTR-/-) pups. Nasal potential difference and transepithelial short circuit current measurements established a robust CF bioelectric phenotype, similar in many respects to that seen in CF patients. Young CFTR-/- rats exhibited histological abnormalities in the ileum and increased intracellular mucus in the proximal nasal septa. By six weeks of age, CFTR-/- males lacked the vas deferens bilaterally. Airway surface liquid and periciliary liquid depth were reduced, and submucosal gland size was abnormal in CFTR-/- animals. Use of ZFN based gene disruption successfully generated a CF animal model that recapitulates many aspects of human disease, and may be useful for modeling other CF genotypes, including CFTR processing defects, premature truncation alleles, and channel gating abnormalities.

In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, we determined the patterns of AREs and factors related to increased risks for AREs in children with CSLD/bronchiectasis. Ninety-three indigenous children aged 0.5 to 8 years with CSLD/bronchiectasis in Australia (n = 57) and Alaska (n = 36) during 2004 to 2009 were followed for > 3 years. Standardized parent interviews, physical examinations, and medical record reviews were undertaken at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Ninety-three children experienced 280 AREs (median = 2, range = 0-11 per child) during the 3-year period; 91 (32%) were associated with pneumonia, and 43 (15%) resulted in hospitalization. Of the 93 children, 69 (74%) experienced more than two AREs over the 3-year period, and 28 (30%) had more than one ARE in each study year. The frequency of AREs declined significantly over each year of follow-up. Factors associated with recurrent (two or more) AREs included age < 3 years, ARE-related hospitalization in the first year of life, and pneumonia or hospitalization for ARE in the year preceding enrollment. Factors associated with hospitalizations for AREs in the first year of study included age < 3 years, female caregiver education, and regular use of bronchodilators. AREs are common in children with CSLD/bronchiectasis, but with clinical care and time AREs occur less frequently. All children with CSLD/bronchiectasis require comprehensive care; however, treatment strategies may differ for these patients based on their changing risks for AREs during each year of care.

"	"CXCL8 (IL-8) recruits and activates neutrophils through the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR1. We showed previously that elastase cleaves CXCR1 and thereby impairs antibacterial host defense. However, the molecular intracellular machinery involved in this process remained undefined. Here we demonstrate by using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, subcellular fractionation, co-immunoprecipitation, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer that combined α- and γ-secretase activities are functionally involved in elastase-mediated regulation of CXCR1 surface expression on human neutrophils, whereas matrix metalloproteases are dispensable. We further demonstrate that PAR-2 is stored in mobilizable compartments in neutrophils. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that secretases, PAR-2, and CXCR1 colocalize and physically interact in a novel protease/secretase-chemokine receptor network. PAR-2 blocking experiments provided evidence that elastase increased intracellular presenilin-1 expression through PAR-2 signaling. When viewed in combination, these studies establish a novel functional network of elastase, secretases, and PAR-2 that regulate CXCR1 expression on neutrophils. Interfering with this network could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in neutrophilic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or rheumatoid arthritis.

"	"The phe508del CFTR mutation causes cystic fibrosis by limiting the amount of CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface. We tested combination treatment with lumacaftor, an investigational CFTR corrector that increases trafficking of phe508del CFTR to the cell surface, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that enhances chloride transport of CFTR on the cell surface. In this phase 2 clinical trial, we assessed three successive cohorts, with the results of each cohort informing dose selection for the subsequent cohort. We recruited patients from 24 cystic fibrosis centres in Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligibility criteria were: confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, age at least 18 years, and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 40% or more than predicted. Cohort 1 included phe508del CFTR homozygous patients randomly assigned to either lumacaftor 200 mg once per day for 14 days followed by addition of ivacaftor 150 mg or 250 mg every 12 h for 7 days, or 21 days of placebo. Together, cohorts 2 and 3 included phe508del CFTR homozygous and heterozygous patients, randomly assigned to either 56 days of lumacaftor (cohort 2: 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg once per day, cohort 3: 400 mg every 12 h) with ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h added after 28 days, or 56 days of placebo. The primary outcomes for all cohorts were change in sweat chloride concentration during the combination treatment period in the intention-to-treat population and safety (laboratory measurements and adverse events). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01225211, and EudraCT, number 2010-020413-90. Cohort 1 included 64 participants. Cohort 2 and 3 combined contained 96 phe508del CFTR homozygous patients and 28 compound heterozygotes. Treatment with lumacaftor 200 mg once daily and ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h decreased mean sweat chloride concentration by 9.1 mmol/L (p<0.001) during the combination treatment period in cohort 1. In cohorts 2 and 3, mean sweat chloride concentration did not decrease significantly during combination treatment in any group. Frequency and nature of adverse events were much the same in the treatment and placebo groups during the combination treatment period; the most commonly reported events were respiratory. 12 of 97 participants had chest tightness or dyspnoea during treatment with lumacaftor alone. In pre-planned secondary analyses, a significant decrease in sweat chloride concentration occurred in the treatment groups between day 1 and day 56 (lumacaftor 400 mg once per day group -9.1 mmol/L, p<0.001; lumacaftor 600 mg once per day group -8.9 mmol/L, p<0.001; lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h group -10.3 mmol/L, p=0.002). These changes were significantly greater than the change in the placebo group. In cohort 2, the lumacaftor 600 mg once per day significantly improved FEV1 from day 1 to 56 (difference compared with placebo group: +5.6 percentage points, p=0.013), primarily during the combination period. In cohort 3, FEV1 did not change significantly across the entire study period compared with placebo (difference +4.2 percentage points, p=0.132), but did during the combination period (difference +7.7 percentage points, p=0·003). Phe508del CFTR heterozygous patients did not have a significant improvement in FEV1. We provide evidence that combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor improves FEV1 for patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for phe508del CFTR, with a modest effect on sweat chloride concentration. These results support the further exploration of combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment in this setting.

"	"Pancreatic gene transfer could be useful to treat several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer. Helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HDAds) are promising tools for gene therapy because of their large cloning capacity, high levels of transgene expression, and long-term persistence in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, the ability of HDAds to transduce the pancreas in vivo has not been investigated yet. Here, we have generated HDAds carrying pancreas-specific expression cassettes, that is, driven either by the elastase or insulin promoter, using a novel and convenient plasmid family and homologous recombination in bacteria. These HDAds were delivered to the pancreas of immunocompetent mice via intrapancreatic duct injection. HDAds, encoding a CMV-GFP reporter cassette, were able to transduce acinar and islet cells, but transgene expression was lost 15 days postinjection in correlation with severe lymphocytic infiltration. When HDAds encoding GFP under the control of the specific elastase promoter were used, expression was detected in acinar cells, but similarly, the expression almost disappeared 30 days postinjection and lymphocytic infiltration was also observed. In contrast, long-term transgene expression (>8 months) was achieved with HDAds carrying the insulin promoter and the secretable alkaline phosphatase as the reporter gene. Notably, transduction of the liver, the preferred target for adenovirus, was minimal by this route of delivery. These data indicate that HDAds could be used for pancreatic gene therapy but that selection of the expression cassette is of critical importance to achieve long-term expression of the transgene in this tissue.

"	"Pulmonary evaluation is one of the greatest challenges in children with cystic fibrosis who are younger than 6 years. Although chest CT can provide the most information for initial and progressive changes in cystic fibrosis, the radiation exposures can lead to significant cumulative exposure in children as they are followed with serial scanning to monitor early and progressive disease. Therefore the systematized study of chest radiographs using the Brasfield score has been used scientifically with the aim of evaluating the evolution of pulmonary abnormalities in children with cystic fibrosis. This study was performed to assess the radiologic findings in children younger than 6 years with cystic fibrosis. We used the Brasfield score to compare radiographs performed in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa vs. oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and to compare radiographs in children with early vs. delayed diagnosis. A total of 254 chest radiographs from 67 children who had undergone material cultures of the airways as part of routine care were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The statistical analysis was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, with a significance level of 5%. Approximately 35.8% of chest radiographs had a Brasfield score lower than 21 points, which is compatible with potentially irreversible pulmonary disease. Brasfield scores decreased (this score decreases with increasing disease severity) in older children, and both bacterial colonization with Pseudomonas and later diagnosis were associated with lower (greater disease) scores.

25076714	"Epidemiological evaluation regarding the role of cystic fibrosis as a risk factor for child malnutrition
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic autosomal recessive disorder with progressive chronic evolution which is potentially lethal. Poor growth is a characteristic of children suffering from cystic fibrosis. A poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for inadequate survival in cystic fibrosis and is associated with disease complications. The appropriate nutritional management is an important part of the treatment so that the patient with cystic fibrosis can achieve normal growth and development and maintain the best possible health status. A balanced diet supplemented with snacks high in fat and calories is necessary to increase the caloric intake in children with cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis have higher caloric needs than healthy children of the same age and sex. Malnutrition in CF is multifactorial. Cystic fibrosis is a complex multisystem disorder affecting mainly the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. In the past, malnutrition was an inevitable consequence of disease progression, leading to poor growth, impaired respiratory muscle function, decreased exercise tolerance and immunological impairment. A positive association between body weight and height and survival has been widely reported. The energy requirements of patients with CF vary widely and generally increase with age and disease severity. Cystic fibrosis remains a paediatric disorder which is often underdiagnosed but which, if therapeutically managed properly (by means of drug therapy as well as by appropriate physiotherapy techniques), can lead to improved quality of life and, thus, to a bigger life expectancy.

"	"Only recently it has been proven that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have the same prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP infection) as the general population, as well as the same spectrum of changes caused by this pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of the two most popular noninvasive tests--the urea breath test (UBT) and the fecal test (FT) in diagnosing HP infection in CF patients. The study was conducted on 79 CF patients and 49 healthy subjects (HS). The presence of HP infection was evaluated using the 13C isotope-labeled urea breath test and the fecal test (ELISA). Fifteen (19.0%) CF patients and eight (16.3%) HS were found to be HP positive using the UBT. The HP stool antigen was detected in twelve (15.2%) CF patients and seven (14.3%) HS. Discordant results for the two tests were obtained in 9 out of 18 (50.0%) CF patients and 3 out of 9 (33.3%) HS. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the risk of potentially false negative and false positive results in CF subjects seems to be high. Similarly, no statistical differences in the basic clinical parameters were documented between the CF subgroups with concordant and divergent HP results. Since there is convincing evidence of divergent UBT and FT results in the CF patients, we suggest that UBT is kept as the standard method for HP detection in this population, at least until obtaining reliable and valid results allows for a change in such an approach.

"	"Cough is part of life in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Weak coughing may add to increased respiratory disease that affects the mechanical properties of cough in these patients. In this study, we investigated cough characteristics in relation to forced expiratory flow/volume indices in CF. This prospective study included 54 subjects (26 ± 10 y old) with CF. Similar indices of the maneuvers were compared. Additionally, other cough characteristics revealed by the maneuvers were investigated. Cough was considered efficient with 6 or more secondary spikes at a flow of > 2.67 L/s. Cough peak flows similar to peak expiratory flows (regardless of FEV1 severity level) were found in 98% of subjects. The secondary spike flows deteriorated alongside the percent-of-predicted FEV1 (r(2) = 0.17, P = .002), yet inefficient secondary spike flows could also be found when FEV1 was within normal range. Mean efficient spike number was low (2.5 ± 1.2 spikes/maneuver). Most cough spike flows were very small (< 0.9 L/s), resembling vibration that may contribute to the propulsion of mucus toward the central airways. Cough maneuver duration ended faster than forced expiration duration (3.7 ± 1.7 s vs 6.8 ± 2.5 s, P < .001), resulting in a smaller cough vital capacity compared with expiratory vital capacity (2.1 ± 0.9 l vs 3.1 ± 0.7 l, P < .001). Inspiratory volume below 2.23 ± 0.07 L reduced efficient secondary spike number. The cough flow/volume maneuver reveals abnormalities in cough velocities and volume. A low secondary spike correlates with FEV1 severity level. The method may lead to earlier intervention to assist cough in CF.

"	"In absence of experimental 3D structures, several homology models, based on ABC exporter 3D structures, have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel whose defects are associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Until now, these models, however, did not furnished much insights into the continuous way that ions could follow from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in the open form of the channel. Here, we have built a refined model of CFTR, based on the outward-facing Sav1866 experimental 3D structure and integrating the evolutionary and structural information available today. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant conformational changes, resulting in a full-open channel, accessible from the cytosol through lateral tunnels displayed in the long intracellular loops (ICLs). At the same time, the region of nucleotide-binding domain 1 in contact with one of the ICLs and carrying amino acid F508, the deletion of which is the most common CF-causing mutation, was found to adopt an alternative but stable position. Then, in a second step, this first stable full-open conformation evolved toward another stable state, in which only a limited displacement of the upper part of the transmembrane helices leads to a closure of the channel, in a conformation very close to that adopted by the Atm1 ABC exporter, in an inward-facing conformation. These models, supported by experimental data, provide significant new insights into the CFTR structure-function relationships and into the possible impact of CF-causing mutations.

"	"In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA®, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve®, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70-146) to 57 (45-64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06-7.28) to 7.39 (7.35-7.49), P < 0.0001. Four patients were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to progressive hypoxia or circulatory failure. Nineteen patients (95%) were successfully transplanted. Hospital and 1-year survival was 75 and 72%, respectively. Bridging to LTX with ECCO2-R delivered by arteriovenous pumpless or venovenous pump-driven ILA is feasible and associated with high transplantation and survival rates.

An ongoing rapid rise in U.S. approvals of specialty therapies for chronic diseases and conditions (e.g., Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, infertility, hepatitis C infection, multiple sclerosis) is fueling demand for pharmacists trained to meet the complex needs of patients receiving those therapies, which are typically subject to risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) requirements and limited distribution arrangements. In 2011, Duquesne University Mylan School of Pharmacy partnered with Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy to launch a one-year community residency program designed to (1) provide enhanced education on diseases and conditions targeted by specialty therapies, (2) develop well-rounded clinicians who are fully knowledgeable of the medications used to treat those disorders, and (3) prepare trainees for the operational and business-related challenges of specialty pharmacy practice. The first half of the residency year emphasizes direct patient care experiences, with team-based rotations focusing on specific disease states and health conditions; the second half of the residency program emphasizes operational-administrative training in areas such as clinical program development, resource utilization review, REMS compliance, contracting, and navigating manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs. Other program components include a one-month external rotation at a managed care organization, research projects, and teaching experiences. A unique community residency program jointly developed by Duquesne University and Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy prepares trainees for careers in diverse clinical, managed care, community-based, and academic practice settings.

In this work, we developed sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanoparticles, namely, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), as a strategy to enhance the antimicrobial therapy against P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. The nanoparticles obtained displayed a 200-400 nm size, high drug entrapment (79-94%) and a sustained drug release profile. Moreover, both SLN and NLC presented antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated P. aeruginosa. The integrity of the nanoparticles was not affected by nebulization through a mesh vibrating nebulizer. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles appeared to be less toxic than free sodium colistimethate in cell culture. Finally, an in vivo distribution experiment showed that nanoparticles spread homogenously through the lung and there was no migration of lipid nanoparticles to other organs, such as liver, spleen or kidneys.

"	"Inhaled antibiotics, such as tobramycin, for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections are associated with the increase in life expectancy seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients over recent years. However, the effectiveness of this aminoglycoside is still limited by its inability to penetrate the thick DNA-rich mucus in the lungs of these patients, leading to low antibiotic exposure to resident bacteria. In this study, we created novel polymeric nanoparticle (NP) delivery vehicles for tobramycin. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we showed that tobramycin binds with alginate polymer and, by exploiting this interaction, optimised the production of tobramycin alginate/chitosan NPs. It was established that NP antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa PA01 was equivalent to unencapsulated tobramycin (minimum inhibitory concentration 0.625mg/L). Galleria mellonella was employed as an in vivo model for P. aeruginosa infection. Survival rates of 90% were observed following injection of NPs, inferring low NP toxicity. After infection with P. aeruginosa, we showed that a lethal inoculum was effectively cleared by tobramycin NPs in a dose dependent manner. Crucially, a treatment with NPs prior to infection provided a longer window of antibiotic protection, doubling survival rates from 40% with free tobramycin to 80% with NP treatment. Tobramycin NPs were then functionalised with dornase alfa (recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I, DNase), demonstrating DNA degradation and improved NP penetration of CF sputum. Following incubation with CF sputum, tobramycin NPs both with and without DNase functionalisation, exhibited anti-pseudomonal effects. Overall, this work demonstrates the production of effective antimicrobial NPs, which may have clinical utility as mucus-penetrating tobramycin delivery vehicles, combining two widely used CF therapeutics into a single NP formulation. This nano-antibiotic represents a strategy to overcome the mucus barrier, increase local drug concentrations, avoid systemic adverse effects and improve outcomes for pulmonary infections in CF.

25512598	"Modulation of CFTR gating by permeant ions
"	"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is unique among ion channels in that after its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), its ATP-dependent gating violates microscopic reversibility caused by the intimate involvement of ATP hydrolysis in controlling channel closure. Recent studies suggest a gating model featuring an energetic coupling between opening and closing of the gate in CFTR's transmembrane domains and association and dissociation of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We found that permeant ions such as nitrate can increase the open probability (Po) of wild-type (WT) CFTR by increasing the opening rate and decreasing the closing rate. Nearly identical effects were seen with a construct in which activity does not require phosphorylation of the regulatory domain, indicating that nitrate primarily affects ATP-dependent gating steps rather than PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the effects of nitrate on CFTR gating are remarkably similar to those of VX-770 (N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide), a potent CFTR potentiator used in clinics. These include effects on single-channel kinetics of WT CFTR, deceleration of the nonhydrolytic closing rate, and potentiation of the Po of the disease-associated mutant G551D. In addition, both VX-770 and nitrate increased the activity of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 (ΔNBD2), indicating that these gating effects are independent of NBD dimerization. Nonetheless, whereas VX-770 is equally effective when applied from either side of the membrane, nitrate potentiates gating mainly from the cytoplasmic side, implicating a common mechanism for gating modulation mediated through two separate sites of action.

A historical cohort study of 52 CF patients younger than 10 years of age were followed in a reference center in Campinas, Southeast Brazil. Anthropometric measurements were abstracted from medical records until March/2010, when neonatal screening program was implemented. Between September/2009 and March/2010, parental height of the 52 CF patients were also measured. Regarding nutritional status, four patients had Z-scores ≤ -2 for height/age (H/A) and body mass index/age (BMI/A). The following variables were associated with improved H/A ratio: fewer hospitalizations, longer time from first appointment to diagnosis, longer time from birth to diagnosis and later onset of respiratory disease. Forced vital capacity [FVC(%)], forced expiratory flow between 25-75% of FVC [FEF25-75(%)], forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1(%)], gestational age, birth weight and early respiratory symptoms were associated with IMC/A. Greater number of hospitalizations, diagnosis delay and early onset of respiratory disease had a negative impact on growth. Lower spirometric values, lower gestational age, lower birth weight, and early onset of respiratory symptoms had negative impact on nutritional status. Malnutrition was observed in 7.7% of cases, but 23% of children had nutritional risk.

"	"Burkholderia cenocepacia is a bacterial pathogen which causes severe respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). These studies were aimed at gaining an insight into the iron acquisition strategies of B. cenocepacia. In iron restricted conditions, genes associated with the synthesis and utilisation of ornibactin (pvdA, orbA, orb F) were significantly upregulated compared to the expression of pyochelin associated genes (pchD, fptA). In the absence of alternative iron sources, B. cenocepacia J2315 and 715j utilised ferritin and haemin, but not transferrin or lactoferrin for growth. Significantly, mutants unable to produce ornibactin, (715j-orbI) or ornibactin and pyochelin, (715j-pobA), utilised haemin and ferritin more efficiently than the wild-type. Moreover, both mutants were also able to utilise lactoferrin for growth (P ≤ 0.01) and additionally 715j-pobA utilised transferrin (P ≤ 0.01), potentially facilitating adaptation to the host environment. Furthermore, B. cenocepacia increased ornibactin gene expression in response to pyoverdine from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P ≤ 0.01), demonstrating the capacity to compete for iron in co-colonised niches. Pyoverdine also significantly diminished the growth of B. cenocepacia (P < 0.001) which was related to its iron chelating activity. In a study of three B. cenocepacia sequential clonal isolates obtained from a CF patient over a 3.5 year period, ornibactin upregulation in response to pyoverdine was less pronounced in the last isolate compared to the earlier isolates, as was growth in the presence of haemin and ferritin, indicating alternative iron acquisition mechanism(s) may dominate as chronic infection progresses. These data demonstrate the multifaceted iron acquisition strategies of B. cenocepacia and their capacity to be differentially activated in the presence of P. aeruginosa and during chronic infection.

Especially Mycobacterium abscessus infections are common but reliable diagnosis is hampered by non-specific clinical symptoms and insensitive mycobacterial culture. In the present study we established novel methods for rapid detection and immune characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in cystic fibrosis patients. We performed Mycobacterium abscessus specific DNA-strip- and quantitative PCR-based analyses of non-cultured sputum samples to detect and characterize Mycobacterium abscessus infections. Concomitantly in vitro T-cell reactivation with purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from different mycobacterial species was used to determine Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cell cytokine expression of infected cystic fibrosis patients. Four of 35 cystic fibrosis patients (11.4%) were Mycobacterium abscessus culture positive and showed concordant DNA-strip-test results. Quantitative PCR revealed marked differences of mycobacterial burden between cystic fibrosis patients and during disease course. Tandem-repeat analysis classified distinct Mycobacterium abscessus strains of infected cystic fibrosis patients and excluded patient-to-patient transmission. Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cells were detected in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients with confirmed chronic infection and a subgroup of patients without evidence of Mycobacterium abscessus infection. Comparison of cytokine expression and phenotypic markers revealed increased proportions of CD40L positive T-cells that lack Interleukin-2 expression as a marker for chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Direct sputum examination enabled rapid diagnosis and quantification of Mycobacterium abscessus in cystic fibrosis patients. T-cell in vitro reactivation and cytokine expression analyses may contribute to diagnosis of chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infection.

While pathological changes can be seen in various organs, morbidity and mortality are mainly related to the respiratory tract, with patients suffering from chronic bronchopulmonary infections with characteristic pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus. To date, there is only very limited data on the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of S. aureus in CF patients. Therefore, in our study, we characterized 58 S. aureus isolates collected from CF patients in Austria by spa typing, DNA microarray profiling, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility testing in order to determine common genomic and antimicrobial resistance features. The tested strain collection exhibited high genomic diversity. The 58 isolates were assigned to 16 clonal complexes and 48 spa types and differed greatly regarding their virulence and resistance gene profiles. The predominant clonal complexes were MLST CC30 (22%), CC15 (16%), CC45 (14%), and CC5 (12%), complexes that are highly prevalent worldwide among S. aureus strains isolated from humans colonized or infected with S. aureus. DNA microarray profiles showed a wide variety of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors such as various leukocidins, haemolysins, enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin, as well as genes involved in adhesion and immune evasion. While a large number of strains exhibited resistance to one or several antimicrobial agents, methicillin-resistant S. aureus was found at a low prevalence of 3% (n = 2) only. The two methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were assigned to CC152/t355 (SCCmecV) and CC5/t001 (SCCmecI).

Substantial amounts of uncleaved LL-37, a 37-mer cationic AMP, were observed in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Nevertheless LL-37 was degraded after prolonged incubation in CF sputum, and the hydrolysis was blocked by E-64, a selective inhibitor of cysteine proteases. Cathepsins K and S, expressed in human alveolar macrophages, thoroughly hydrolyzed LL-37 in vitro, whereas it competitively inhibited cathepsin L (Ki = 150 nM). Cleavage of LL-37 by cathepsins S and K impaired its antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The exchange of residues 67 and 205 in the S2 pockets of cathepsins L (Leu67Tyr/Ala205Leu) and K (Tyr67Leu/Leu205Ala) switched the specificity of these mutants toward LL-37. Molecular modeling suggested that LL-37 interacted with the active site of cathepsin L in both forward (i.e., substrate-like) and reverse orientations with similar binding energies.

Multiple porins modulate outer membrane permeability under various environmental conditions. The lung environment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is unique with changes occurring in nutrient availability, osmolarity, and oxygen content. Although P. aeruginosa gene expression is modified under these conditions, little is known about how they influence porin regulation. In this study, we evaluated the regulation of the outer membrane porin OpdQ, a member of the OprD family of porins, with regard to oxygen, nitrate, and/or NaCl levels. We demonstrated using promoter::fusion clones of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and clinical strains collected from CF patients that OpdQ was transcriptionally repressed under low oxygen but increased in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ was found to be dependent on the transcription factor NarL via the NarXL two-component system. In addition, NaCl-induced osmotic stress increased OpdQ production among most of the clinical strains evaluated. In conclusion, these data identify for the first time that specific environmental cues associated with the CF microenvironment influence porin regulation, and that the nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ is associated with nitrate metabolism via the NarXL two-component system of P. aeruginosa.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, is a life-limiting disease characterized by chronic bacterial airway infection and severe inflammation. Some CFTR mutants have reduced responsiveness to cAMP/PKA signaling; hence, pharmacological agents that elevate intracellular cAMP are potentially useful for the treatment of CF. By inhibiting cAMP breakdown, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors stimulate CFTR in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that PDE inhibition by RPL554, a drug that has been shown to cause bronchodilation in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, stimulates CFTR-dependent ion secretion across bronchial epithelial cells isolated from patients carrying the R117H/F508del CF genotype. RPL554-induced CFTR activity was further increased by the potentiator VX-770, suggesting an additional benefit by the drug combination. RPL554 also increased cilia beat frequency in primary human bronchial epithelial cells.

"	"Scedosporium boydii is an opportunistic filamentous fungus which may be responsible for a large variety of infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. This fungus belongs to the Scedosporium apiospermum species complex which usually ranks second among the filamentous fungi colonizing the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Species of the S. apiospermum complex are able to chronically colonize the CF airways suggesting pathogenic mechanisms allowing persistence and growth of these fungi in the respiratory tract. Few putative virulence factors have been purified and characterized so far in the S. apiospermum complex including a cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a monofunctional catalase (catalase A1). Upon microbial infection, host phagocytes release reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, as part of the antimicrobial response. Catalases are known to protect pathogens against ROS by degradation of the hydrogen peroxide. Here, we identified the S. boydii catalase A1 gene (CATA1) and investigated its expression in response to the environmental conditions encountered in the CF airways and to the oxidative stress. Results showed that S. boydii CATA1 gene expression is not affected by hypoxia, hypercapnia or pH changes. In contrast, CATA1 gene was overexpressed in response to a chemically induced oxidative stress with a relative gene expression 37-fold higher in the presence of 250 μM H(2)O(2), 20-fold higher with 250 μM menadione and 5-fold higher with 2 mM paraquat. Moreover, S. boydii CATA1 gene expression progressively increased upon exposure to activated THP-1-derived macrophages, reaching a maximum after 12 h (26 fold). Activated HL60-derived neutrophils and activated human peripheral blood neutrophils more rapidly induced S. boydii CATA1 gene overexpression, a maximum gene expression level being reached at 75 min (17 fold) and 60 min (15 fold), respectively. In contrast expression of the gene encoding the Cu,Zn-SOD (SODC gene) was not affected by H(2)O(2), menadione, paraquat or in co-culture with phagocytic cells. These results suggest that S. boydii CATA1 gene is highly stimulated by the oxidative burst response whereas SODC gene is constitutively expressed.

26824272	"Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures based on volatile biomarker combinations
"	"Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath is proposed as a non-invasive method to detect respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Since polymicrobial infections are common, we assessed whether we could distinguish Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures using the VOC emissions. We took headspace samples of P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus and co-cultures at 16, 24 and 48 h after inoculation, in which VOCs were identified by thermal desorption combined with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Using multivariate analysis by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis we found distinct VOC biomarker combinations for mono- and co-cultures at each sampling time point, showing that there is an interaction between the two pathogens, with P. aeruginosa dominating the co-culture at 48 h. Furthermore, time-independent VOC biomarker combinations were also obtained to predict correct identification of P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus in mono-culture and in co-culture. This study shows that the VOC combinations in P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus co-microbial environment are different from those released by these pathogens in mono-culture. Using advanced data analysis techniques such as PLS-DA, time-independent pathogen specific biomarker combinations can be generated that may help to detect mixed respiratory infections in exhaled breath of cystic fibrosis patients.

"	"Here, the preparation of mucus-penetrating nanoparticles for pulmonary administration of ibuprofen in patients with cystic fibrosis is described. A fluorescent derivative of α,β-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamide is synthesized by derivatization with rhodamine, polylactide, and poly(ethylene glycol), to obtain polyaspartamide-polylactide derivatives with different degrees of pegylation. Starting from these copolymers, fluorescent nanoparticles with different poly(ethylene glycol) content, empty and loaded with ibuprofen, showed spherical shape, colloidal size, slightly negative ζ potential, and biocompatibility toward human bronchial epithelial cells. The high surface poly(ethylene glycol) density of fluorescent nanoparticles and poly(ethylene glycol) brush-like conformation assumed on their surface, conferred to pegylated nanoparticles the mucus-penetrating properties, properly demonstrated by assessing their ability to avoid interactions with mucus components and to penetrate cystic fibrosis artificial mucus. Finally, ibuprofen release profile and uptake capacity within human bronchial epithelial cells in the presence of cystic fibrosis artificial mucus showed how these mucus-penetrating nanoparticles could rapidly diffuse through the mucus barrier reaching the mucosal surface, where they could offer a sustained delivery of ibuprofen at the site of disease.

26874684	"Function and regulation of TRPM7, as well as intracellular magnesium content, are altered in cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common fatal hereditary disorders, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene product is a multidomain adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) protein that functions as a chloride (Cl(-)) channel that is regulated by intracellular magnesium [Mg(2+)]i. The most common mutations in CFTR are a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR, 70-80 % of CF phenotypes) and a Gly551Asp substitution (G551D-CFTR, 4-5 % of alleles), which lead to decreased or almost abolished Cl(-) channel function, respectively. Magnesium ions have to be finely regulated within cells for optimal expression and function of CFTR. Therefore, the melastatin-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7), which is responsible for Mg(2+) entry, was studies and [Mg(2+)]i measured in cells stably expressing wildtype CFTR, and two mutant proteins (ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR). This study shows for the first time that [Mg(2+)]i is decreased in cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR mutated proteins. It was also observed that the expression of the TRPM7 protein is increased; however, membrane localization was altered for both ΔF508del-CFTR and G551D-CFTR. Furthermore, both the function and regulation of the TRPM7 channel regarding Mg(2+) is decreased in the cells expressing the mutated CFTR. Ca(2+) influx via TRPM7 were also modified in cells expressing a mutated CFTR. Therefore, there appears to be a direct involvement of TRPM7 in CF physiopathology. Finally, we propose that the TRPM7 activator Naltriben is a new potentiator for G551D-CFTR as the function of this mutant increases upon activation of TRPM7 by Naltriben.

The present study aimed to create and validate a Spanish version of the LCQ (LCQ-Sp) in NCFBC. The LCQ-Sp was developed following a standardized protocol. For reliability, we assessed internal consistency and the change in score over a 15-day period in stable state. For responsiveness, we assessed the change in scores between visit 1 and the first exacerbation. For validity, we evaluated convergent validity through correlation with the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and discriminant validity. Two hundred fifty-nine patients (118 mild bronchiectasis, 90 moderate bronchiectasis and 47 severe bronchiectasis) were included. Internal consistency was high for the total scoring and good for the different domains (Cronbach's α: 0.86-0.91). The test-retest reliability shows an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 for the total score. The mean LCQ-Sp score at visit 1 decreased at the beginning of an exacerbation (15.13 ± 4.06 vs. 12.24 ± 4.64; p < 0.001). The correlation between LCQ-Sp and SGRQ scores was -0.66 (p < 0.01). The differences in the LCQ-Sp total score between the different groups of severity were significant (p < 0.001). The LCQ-Sp discriminates disease severity, is responsive to change when faced with exacerbations and is reliable for use in bronchiectasis.

27146408	"Characterization of mitochondrial function in cells with impaired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function
"	"Evidence supporting the occurrence of oxidative stress in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is well established and the literature suggests that oxidative stress is inseparably linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we have characterized mitochondrial function, in particular as it regards the steps of oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production, in airway cells either homozygous for the F508del-CFTR allele or stably expressing wt-CFTR. We find that oxygen consumption, ΔΨ generation, adenine nucleotide translocator-dependent ADP/ATP exchange and both mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities are impaired in CF cells, while both mitochondrial ROS production and membrane lipid peroxidation increase. Importantly, treatment of CF cells with the small molecules VX-809 and 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin, which act as ""correctors"" for F508del CFTR by rescuing the F508del CFTR-dependent chloride secretion, while having no effect per sè on mitochondrial function in wt-CFTR cells, significantly improved all the above mitochondrial parameters towards values found in the airway cells expressing wt-CFTR. This novel study on mitochondrial bioenergetics provides a springboard for future research to further understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the involvement of mitochondria in CF and identify the proteins primarily responsible for the F508del-CFTR-dependent mitochondrial impairment and thus reveal potential novel targets for CF therapy.

Its levels in specimens from murine models and asthmatic patients are related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) reportedly have higher arginase activity, lower NO production and NOS expression than healthy controls. The objective was to assess the role of ADMA and related metabolites as disease biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of pediatric CF patients, compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC). A longitudinal design was conceived and 34 CF patients (21 stable, 13 at the onset of exacerbation) and 16 HC were enrolled. All CF patients underwent clinical examination, spirometry and EBC collection at enrolment; the same tests were performed also after an antibiotic course in those patients with exacerbation. Metabolites levels in EBC were measured with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry technique. All CF patients had ADMA levels (expressed as ratio to tyrosine) similar to those in HC (median 0.0112, IQR 0.0103-0.0120 and median 0.0114, IQR 0.0090-0.0128, respectively; P = 0.983), while a significant increase in the citrulline/tyrosine ratio was found in CF patients (median 0.6419, IQR 0.5738-0.6899 in CF vs median 0.4176, IQR 0.2986-0.5082 in HC; P = 0.00003). No differences in ADMA levels emerged between stable patients and those with exacerbation. ADMA and related aminoacids were measured simultaneously for the first time in EBC from CF patients. Higher citrulline/tyrosine ratios were found in CF children with normal ADMA levels, suggesting a dysregulated ADMA metabolism in these patients.

"	"To examine long-term growth benefit of newborn screening (NBS), adolescent peak height velocity (PHV), and adult height were compared between the screened (diagnosed early via NBS) and the control (identified generally by symptoms) in the Wisconsin Randomized Clinical Trial. Data from 107 children born in 1985-1994 and followed through 2012 were analyzed. PHV was estimated by a semiparametric growth curve model and compared with Tanner reference. Meconium ileus (MI; n = 25) was associated with the worst pubertal growth and adult height, including 1 child who did not experience apparent PHV; children with pancreatic sufficiency (n = 18) achieved the best growth (normal PHV and adult height). In children with pancreatic insufficiency without meconium ileus (n = 64), the subgroup most likely to benefit from NBS, screened children had similar PHV but better adult height compared with controls. Specifically, in boys, the screened group (n = 22) achieved normal PHV (9.5 cm at 13.5 years); the control group (n = 19) had similar onset age (13.6 years) but 0.6-cm lower magnitude (P = .08). In girls, the screened group (n = 10) had somewhat later (12.5 years vs 11.7 years, P = .12) and lower PHV (7.3 cm vs 7.9 cm, P = .33) than the controls (n = 13), coinciding with later menarche (13.6 years vs 12.2 years, P = .10). Adult height was taller in the screened than the control (50th vs 29th percentile, P = .02), even after adjusted for genetic potential (32nd vs15th percentile, P = .006). Differences in adult height were primarily attributable to NBS and better prepubertal growth. Early linear growth benefits of NBS were sustained through puberty, leading to better adult height in cystic fibrosis.

It is unclear whether the same is true for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). To determine in children with PCD treated with intravenous antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation: (1) the proportion who recover to baseline forced expiratory volume at 1 sec (FEV1 ) within 3 months after treatment and (2) to try to identify factors which are associated with failure to regain pre-exacerbation FEV1 . Cohort study using the PCD database for children at the Royal Brompton Hospital, 2003-2013. We selected the first pulmonary exacerbation treated with intravenous antibiotics. The best FEV1 within 3 months after treatment was compared to the best FEV1 in the 12 months before treatment (baseline). Recovery to baseline was defined as any FEV1 after treatment that was greater than or equal to 90% of the baseline FEV1 . 32/150 children (21%) had at least one pulmonary exacerbation. 23/30 (77%) regained baseline spirometry within 3 months of treatment. There was no difference between responders and non-responders in any baseline characteristics. Around 25% of children with PCD fail to recover to baseline lung function within 3 months following treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation, similar to CF. Better treatment strategies are needed, and the results also suggest that prevention of exacerbations would be a useful end-point in clinical trials.

This study was designed as a cross-sectional study in one year section. Demographic features were compared with standard percentiles curves. Chol, TG, albumin, total protein, prothrombin time, and hemoglobin were measured. Stool exams were also performed. A questionnaire was designed to obtain a history of the first presentation of disease, birth weight, type of labor and parent relativity. In 52% of patients, failure to thrive (FTT) was the first presentation. Steatorrhea and respiratory infections were the first presentations, which were seen in 13.7% and 33% of the cases, respectively. The weight of 88% of patients was below the 15th percentile while 82% had a height percentile below 15th. Head circumference in 53% of patients was below the 15th percentile. There was a significant association between weight percentile and serum albumin and total protein (P=0.03 and P=0.007, respectively). There was also a significant relationship between height percentile and serum albumin and total protein (P<0.001 and P<0.000, respectively). The relationships between head circumference and serum albumin and total protein were also significant (P=0.006 and P<0.000, respectively). There was also a significant association between height percentile and hemoglobin. The decrease in anthropometric percentiles leads to decreased serum albumin and total protein.

"	"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antibiotics in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are common and often mislabeled as allergies. The labeling of an antibiotic reaction as an allergy can lead to the use of antibiotics that are less efficacious, are more expensive, or have a greater risk of adverse effects. To establish a safe approach for the evaluation of ADRs to antibiotics in patients with CF to help clarify future use of these medications. Patients with CF whose antibiotic allergies were causing difficulty in their medical management were referred for an allergy evaluation that consisted of a thorough drug allergy history and antibiotic testing if appropriate. If the history was not consistent with a true hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and test results were negative, the patient underwent a challenge to the offending agent(s) to rule out an HSR. Challenges were only performed if the medication was indicated for future use. A total of 17 patients (mean age, 32.4 years) underwent a thorough allergy evaluation. A total of 17 antibiotic challenges were performed in 11 patients without a reaction consistent with an HSR or severe delayed reaction. Only 2 medications had a history consist with an HSR, and it was recommended that they undergo a desensitization procedure if the drug was required. If treatment with appropriate antibiotics becomes difficult in patients with CF because of drug allergies, then referral to an allergist can help safely identify treatment options. Our findings suggest that a thorough evaluation by an allergy specialist can lead to more appropriate treatment options in patients with CF.

"	"Preexisting donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) have been associated with reduced survival of lung allografts. However, antibodies with specificities other than HLA may have a detrimental role on the lung transplant outcome. A young man with cystic fibrosis underwent lung transplantation with organs from a suitable deceased donor. At the time of transplantation, there were no anti-HLA DSAs. During surgery, the patient developed a severe and intractable pulmonary hypertension associated with right ventriular dysfunction, which required arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. After a brief period of clinical improvement, a rapid deterioration in hemodynamics led to the patient's death on postoperative day 5. Postmortem studies showed that lung specimens taken at the end of surgery were compatible with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), while terminal samples evidenced diffuse capillaritis, blood extravasation, edema, and microthrombi, with foci of acute cellular rejection (A3). Immunological investigations demonstrated the presence of preexisting antibodies against the endothelin-1 receptor type A (ETA R) and the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 R), two of the most potent vasoconstrictors reported to date, whose levels slightly rose after transplantation. These data suggest that preexisting anti-ETA R and anti-AT1 R antibodies may have contributed to the onset of AMR and to the catastrophic clinical course of this patient.

"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is common in cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease also characterized by abundant extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the airways. The eDNA is mainly derived from neutrophils accumulating in the airways and contributes to a high sputum viscosity. The altered environment in the lower airways also paves the way for chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we show that mice with P. aeruginosa airway infection have increased survival and decreased bacterial load after topical treatment with DNase. Furthermore, DNA from the sputum of CF patients showed increased bactericidal activity after treatment with DNase ex vivo. Both degraded DNA of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and genomic DNA degraded by serum, acquired bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa In vitro, small synthetic DNA-fragments (<100 base pairs) but not large fragments nor genomic DNA, were bactericidal against Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of divalent cations reduced bacterial killing, suggesting that chelation of divalent cations by DNA results in destabilization of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) envelope. This is a novel antibacterial strategy where fragmentation of eDNA and DNA-fragments can be used to treat P. aeruginosa airway infection.

"	"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been recognized to play an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), and targeting ER stress may be useful for alleviating damaging neutrophilic inflammation in CF airways. Cellular models were used in conjunction with data from a recent CF genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to determine modulators of ER stress-mediated inflammation. Surprisingly, cells undergoing ER stress during inflammatory stimulation showed reduced interleukin 8 (IL-8) and CXCL1 secretion (P < .001). Neutralization of CXCL1 and IL-8 reduced neutrophil chemotaxis >50% to supernatants from IL-1β-stimulated CF airway epithelial cells (P < .01). The clinical importance of these chemokines was validated by association of CXCL1 and IL8 polymorphisms with changes in lung disease severity in patients with CF (n = 6365; IL8, P = .001; CXCL1, P = .001), confirming that targeting these chemokine pathways could help improve lung disease. We determined that production of these chemokines was partially controlled by ER stress in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent manner, whereby ER stress inhibited STAT3 activation. Our findings support a role for CXCL1 and IL-8 in CF lung disease severity and identify STAT3 as a modulating pathway. Targeting these pathways may help improve health outcomes in CF.

"	"W1282X is the fifth most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation that causes cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the utility of a small molecule corrector/potentiator strategy, as used for ΔF508-CFTR, to produce functional rescue of the truncated translation product of the W1282X mutation, CFTR1281, without the need for read-through. In transfected cell systems, certain potentiators and correctors, including VX-809 and VX-770, increased CFTR1281 activity. To identify novel correctors and potentiators with potentially greater efficacy on CFTR1281, functional screens were done of ∼30,000 synthetic small molecules and drugs/nutraceuticals in CFTR1281-transfected cells. Corrector scaffolds of 1-arylpyrazole-4-arylsulfonyl-piperazine and spiro-piperidine-quinazolinone classes were identified with up to ∼5-fold greater efficacy than VX-809, some of which were selective for CFTR1281, whereas others also corrected ΔF508-CFTR. Several novel potentiator scaffolds were identified with efficacy comparable with VX-770; remarkably, a phenylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine acted synergistically with VX-770 to increase CFTR1281 function ∼8-fold over that of VX-770 alone, normalizing CFTR1281 channel activity to that of wild type CFTR. Corrector and potentiator combinations were tested in primary cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells generated from nasal brushings from one W1282X homozygous subject. Although robust chloride conductance was seen with correctors and potentiators in homozygous ΔF508 cells, increased chloride conductance was not found in W1282X cells despite the presence of adequate transcript levels. Notwithstanding the negative data in W1282X cells from one human subject, we speculate that corrector and potentiator combinations may have therapeutic efficacy in cystic fibrosis caused by the W1282X mutation, although additional studies are needed on human cells from W1282X subjects.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) occurrence in Arab populations is not common and still remains underidentified. Furthermore, the lack of disease awareness and diagnosis facilities have mislead the identification of cystic fibrosis for decades. The knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) in Egypt is very limited, and a few reports have drawn attention to the existence of CF or CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RDs) in the Egyptian population. Therefore a comprehensive genetic analysis of the CFTR gene was realized in patients of North Egypt. DNA samples of 56 Egyptian patients were screened for the CFTR gene mutations. The 27 exons and their flanking regions of the CFTR gene were amplified by PCR, using the published primer pairs, and were studied by automated direct DNA sequencing to detect disease-causing mutations. Moreover, large duplication/deletion was analysed by MLPA technique. CFTR screening revealed the identification of thirteen mutations including four novel ones: c.92G&gt;A (p.Arg31His), c.2782G&gt;C (p.Ala928Pro), c.3718-24G&gt;A, c.4207A&gt;G (p.Arg1403Gly) and nine previously reported mutations: c.454A&gt;T (p.Met152Leu), c.902A&gt;G (p.Tyr301Cys), c.1418delG, c.2620-15C&gt;G, c.2997\_3000delAATT, c.3154T&gt;G (p.Phe1052Val), c.3872A&gt;G (p.Gln1291Arg), c.3877G&gt;A (p.Val1293Ile), c.4242+10T&gt;C. Furthermore, eight polymorphisms were found: c.743+40A&gt;G, c.869+11C&gt;T, c.1408A&gt;G, c.1584G&gt;A, c.2562T&gt;G, c.3870A&gt;G, c.4272C&gt;T, c.4389G&gt;A. These mutations and polymorphisms were not previously described in the Egyptian population except for the c.1408A&gt;G polymorphism. Here we demonstrate the importance of the newly discovered mutations in Egyptian patients and the presence of CF, whereas the p.Phe508del mutation is not detected. The identification of CFTR mutations will become increasingly important in undocumented populations. The current findings will help us expand the mutational spectrum of CF and establish the first panel of the CFTR gene mutations in the Egyptian population and design an appropriate strategy for future genetic diagnosis of CF.

Group 1 (Flortec) had their sperm count improved: volume of the ejaculate (median from 2.4 to 3.1 mL; p < 0.01), sperm concentration (median: from 15.2 × 10(6) /mL to 28.3 × 10(6) /39 mL; p < 0.01), progressive motility (median: from 16.2 to 42.0%; p < 0.01), and the percentage of typical forms (median: from 7 to 16.3%; p < 0.01); in addition, their FSH, LH, and T levels improved (p < 0.01), while those of E2 and PRL did not. Group 2 (control substance) had no modification in 42 of the parameters studied. There were no side effects in either group. These data showed that Flortec constitutes a safe therapy for improving the volume of the ejaculate and the quality/quantity of spermatozoa in iOAT patients.

28633068	"Multi-electrode system for measurement of transmembrane ion-fluxes through living epithelial cells
"	"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal human genetic disease. It is caused by the defect in a single anion channel protein which affects ion and water transport across the epithelial tissue. A flat multi-electrode platform of diameter 12mm, allowing for measurement of four ions: sodium, potassium, hydrogen and chloride by exchangeable/replaceable ion-selective electrodes is described. The measurement is possible owing to the architecture of the platform which accommodates all the electrodes and inlets/outlets. The platform fits to the cup and operates in a small volume of the solution bathing the living epithelial cell layer (membrane) deposited on a porous support of the cup, which allows for effective monitoring of ion concentration changes. By applying two multi-electrode platforms, it is possible to measure the ion transmembrane fluxes. The inlet and outlet tubes in the platforms allow for on-fly change of the calibrants, ion-concentration changes and ion channel blockers. Using different ion-concentration gradients and blockers of ion-transporting molecules we show for the first time that sodium ions flow from the basolateral to apical face of the cell monolayer via a paracellular route and return also via a transcellular one, while chloride anions are transported back and forth exclusively via a transcellular route.

"	"Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising alternative to computed tomography for lung imaging. However, organ motion and poor signal-to-noise ratio, arising from short T2\*, impair image quality. To alleviate these issues, a new retrospective gating method was implemented and tested with an ultra-short echo time sequence. A 3D double-echo ultra-short echo time sequence was used to acquire data during free breathing in ten healthy adult subjects. A self-gating method was used to reconstruct respiratory motion suppressed expiratory and inspiratory images. These images were objectively compared to uncorrected data sets using quantitative end-points (pulmonary vessel sharpness, lung-liver interface definition, signal-to-noise ratio). The method was preliminarily tested in two cystic fibrosis patients who underwent computed tomography. Vessel sharpness in expiratory ultra-short echo time data sets with second echo motion detection was significantly higher (13% relative increase) than in uncorrected images while the opposite was observed in inspiratory images. The method was successfully applied in patients and some findings (e.g., hypointense areas) were similar to those from computed tomography. Free breathing ultra-short echo time was successfully implemented, allowing flexible image reconstruction of two different respiratory states. Objective improvements in image quality were obtained with the new method and initial feasibility in a clinical setting was demonstrated.

28974743	"Targeting the alternative sigma factor RpoN to combat virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that infects immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients. Treatment is difficult due to antibiotic resistance, and new antimicrobials are needed to treat infections. The alternative sigma factor 54 (σ54, RpoN), regulates many virulence-associated genes. Thus, we evaluated inhibition of virulence in P. aeruginosa by a designed peptide (RpoN molecular roadblock, RpoN_) which binds specifically to RpoN consensus promoters. We expected that RpoN_ binding to its consensus promoter sites would repress gene expression and thus virulence by blocking RpoN and/or other transcription factors. RpoN_ reduced transcription of approximately 700 genes as determined by microarray analysis, including genes related to virulence. RpoN_ expression significantly reduced motility, protease secretion, pyocyanin and pyoverdine production, rhamnolipid production, and biofilm formation. Given the effectiveness of RpoN_ in vitro, we explored its effects in a Caenorhabditis elegans-P. aeruginosa infection model. Expression of RpoN_ protected C. elegans in a paralytic killing assay, whereas worms succumbed to paralysis and death in its absence. In a slow killing assay, which mimics establishment and proliferation of an infection, C. elegans survival was prolonged when RpoN\* was expressed. Thus, blocking RpoN consensus promoter sites is an effective strategy for abrogation of P. aeruginosa virulence.

"	"Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression is a major tool to understand bacterial responses to environmental changes. In particular, pathogenic bacteria employ sRNAs to adapt to the host environment and establish infection. Members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, normally present in soil microbiota, cause nosocomial lung infection especially in hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients. We sequenced the draft genome of Burkholderia cenocepacia KC-01, isolated from the coastal saline soil, and identified several potential sRNAs in silico. Expression of seven small RNAs (Bc_KC_sr1-7) was subsequently confirmed. Two sRNAs (Bc_KC_sr1 and Bc_KC_sr2) were upregulated in response to iron depletion by 2,2'-bipyridyl and another two (Bc_KC_sr3 and Bc_KC_sr4) responded to the presence of 60 µM H2O2 in the culture media. Bc_Kc_sr5, 6 and 7 remained unchanged under these conditions. Expression of Bc_KC_sr2, 3 and 4 also altered with a change in temperature and incubation time. A search in the Rfam and BSRD databases identified Bc_Kc_sr4 as candidate738 in B. pseudomallei D286 and assigned Bc_Kc_sr5 and 6 as tmRNA and 6S RNA, respectively. The novel sRNAs were conserved in Burkholderiaceae but did not have any homologue in other genera. Bc_KC_sr1 and 4 were transcribed independently while the rest were part of the 3' UTR of their upstream genes. TargetRNA2 predicted that these sRNAs could target a host of cellular messages with very high stringency. Intriguingly, regions surrounding the translation initiation site for several enzymes involved in Fe-S cluster and siderophore biosynthesis, ROS homeostasis, porins, transcription and translation regulators, were among the suggested putative binding sites for these sRNAs.

"	"Cataracts cause vision loss and blindness by impairing the ability of the ocular lens to focus light onto the retina. Various cataract risk factors have been identified, including drug treatments, age, smoking and diabetes. However, the molecular events responsible for these different forms of cataract are ill-defined, and the advent of modern cataract surgery in the 1960s virtually eliminated access to human lenses for research. Here, we demonstrate large-scale production of light-focusing human micro-lenses from spheroidal masses of human lens epithelial cells purified from differentiating pluripotent stem cells. The purified lens cells and micro-lenses display similar morphology, cellular arrangement, mRNA expression and protein expression to human lens cells and lenses. Exposing the micro-lenses to the emergent cystic fibrosis drug Vx-770 reduces micro-lens transparency and focusing ability. These human micro-lenses provide a powerful and large-scale platform for defining molecular disease mechanisms caused by cataract risk factors, for anti-cataract drug screening and for clinically relevant toxicity assays.

"	"High levels of shear stress can prevent and disrupt Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation in vitro. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) could be used to introduce shear stress into the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to disrupt biofilms in vivo. We performed a first-of-its-kind pilot clinical study to evaluate short-term IPV therapy at medium (200 bursts per minute, bpm) and high frequency (400 bpm) as compared to autogenic drainage (AD) on lung function and the behavior of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung in four patients who are chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. A significant difference between the three treatment groups was observed for both the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) (p < 0.05). More specifically, IPV at high frequency significantly increased FEV1 and FVC compared to AD (p < 0.05) and IPV at medium frequency (p < 0.001). IPV at high frequency enhanced the expression levels of P. aeruginosa planktonic marker genes, which was less pronounced with IPV at medium frequency or AD. In conclusion, IPV at high frequency could potentially alter the behavior of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung and improve lung function. The trail was retrospectively registered at the ISRCTN registry on 6 June 2013, under trial registration number ISRCTN75391385.

29572268	"A transcription factor network represses CFTR  gene expression in airway epithelial cells
"	"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung disease is the major cause of CF morbidity, though CFTR expression levels are substantially lower in the airway epithelium than in pancreatic duct and intestinal epithelia, which also show compromised function in CF. Recently developed small molecule therapeutics for CF are highly successful for one specific CFTR mutation and have a positive impact on others. However, the low abundance of CFTR transcripts in the airway limits the opportunity for drugs to correct the defective substrate. Elucidation of the transcriptional mechanisms for the CFTR locus has largely focused on intragenic and intergenic tissue-specific enhancers and their activating trans-factors. Here, we investigate whether the low CFTR levels in the airway epithelium result from the recruitment of repressive proteins directly to the locus. Using an siRNA screen to deplete ∼1500 transcription factors (TFs) and associated regulatory proteins in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, we identified nearly 40 factors that upon depletion elevated CFTR mRNA levels more than 2-fold. A subset of these TFs was validated in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Among the strongest repressors of airway expression of CFTR were Krüppel-like factor 5 and Ets homologous factor, both of which have pivotal roles in the airway epithelium. Depletion of these factors, which are both recruited to an airway-selective cis-regulatory element at -35 kb from the CFTR promoter, improved CFTR production and function, thus defining novel therapeutic targets for enhancement of CFTR.

"	"Chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Shared P. aeruginosa strains, that can be transmitted between patients, are of concern and in Australia the AUST-02 shared strain is predominant in individuals attending CF centres in Queensland and Western Australia. M3L7 is a multidrug resistant sub-type of AUST-02 that was recently identified in a Queensland CF centre and was shown to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The main aim of this study was to resolve the relationship of the emergent M3L7 sub-type within the AUST-02 group of strains using whole genome sequencing. A whole genome core phylogeny of 63 isolates indicated that M3L7 is a monophyletic sub-lineage within the context of the broader AUST-02 group. Relatively short branch lengths connected all of the M3L7 isolates. A phylogeny based on nucleotide polymorphisms present across the genome showed that the chronological estimation of the most recent common ancestor was around 2001 (± 3 years). SNP differences between sequential non-hypermutator M3L7 isolates collected 3-4 years apart from five patients suggested both continuous infection of the same strain and cross-infection of some M3L7 variants between patients. The majority of polymorphisms that were characteristic of M3L7 (i.e. acquired after divergence from all other AUST-02 isolates sequenced) were found to produce non-synonymous mutations in virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. M3L7 has recently diverged from a common ancestor, indicating descent from a single carrier at a CF treatment centre in Australia. Both adaptation to the lung and transmission of M3L7 between adults attending this centre may have contributed to its rapid dissemination. Further genomic investigations are required on multiple intra-sample isolates of this sub-type to decipher potential mechanisms which facilitates its epidemiological success.

Systematic review of clinical guidelines current as at 22 September 2017, including assessment of quality of each guideline using the iCAHE 'Guideline Quality Checklist', and mapping of the supporting evidence. Fifteen guidelines were identified: asthma (n=7) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=7), CF (n=1). Guideline quality was variable, and 11 different grading systems were used. In total, there were 28 recommendations promoting age/developmental considerations. Recommendations focused on: collaboration (n=15), chronic condition self-management education (n= 17), clinicians' skills (n= 4); personalized action plans (n=3), problem-solving (n=2); and the assessment of children's chronic condition self-management needs (n=3). Developmental transitions are highlighted as important time points in some guidelines: preschool (n=2), and adolescence (n=3). All guidelines encouraged triadic partnerships between children, adult caregivers and clinicians. Evidence supporting the developmental aspects of the guidelines' recommendations was poor; only 14 out of 57 journals listed as evidence were concordant. Current guidelines articulate that developmentally appropriate chronic condition self-management is important; however, more work needs to be done to translate the concept into practical clinical tools.

"	"The Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, is a teleost fish native to estuarine waters that vary in salinity between fresh water (FW) and seawater (SW). The neuroendocrine system plays a key role in salinity acclimation by directing ion uptake and extrusion in osmoregulatory tissues such as gill. While most studies with O. mossambicus have focused on acclimation to steady-state salinities, less is known about the ability of adult fish to acclimate to dynamically-changing salinities. Plasma osmolality, prolactin (PRL) levels, and branchial gene expression of PRL receptors (PRLR1 and PRLR2), Na+/Cl- and Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporters (NCC and NKCC), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKAα1a and NKAα1b), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and aquaporin 3 (AQP3) were measured in fish reared in FW and SW steady-state salinities, in a tidal regimen (TR) where salinities changed between FW and SW every six hours, and in fish transferred from FW or SW to TR. Regardless of rearing regimen, plasma osmolality was higher in fish in SW than in FW fish, while plasma PRL was lower in fish in SW. Furthermore, branchial gene expression of effectors of ion transport in TR fish showed greater similarity to those in steady-state SW fish than in FW fish. By seven days of transfer from steady-state FW or SW to TR, plasma osmolality, plasma PRL and branchial expression of effectors of ion transport were similar to those of fish reared in TR since larval stages. These findings demonstrate the ability of adult tilapia reared in steady-state salinities to successfully acclimate to dynamically-changing salinities. Moreover, the present findings suggest that early exposure to salinity changes does not significantly improve survivability in future challenge with dynamically-changing salinities.

"	"Quorum sensing (QS) signals are widely used by bacterial pathogens to control biological functions and virulence in response to changes in cell population densities. Burkholderia cenocepacia employs a molecular mechanism in which the cis-2-dodecenoic acid (named Burkholderiadiffusible signal factor [BDSF]) QS system regulates N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal production and virulence by modulating intracellular levels of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Thus, inhibition of BDSF signaling may offer a non-antibiotic-based therapeutic strategy against BDSF-regulated bacterial infections. In this study, we report the synthesis of small-molecule mimics of the BDSF signal and evaluate their ability to inhibit BDSF QS signaling in B. cenocepacia A novel structural analogue of BDSF, 14-Me-C16:Δ2 (cis-14-methylpentadec-2-enoic acid), was observed to inhibit BDSF production and impair BDSF-regulated phenotypes in B. cenocepacia, including motility, biofilm formation, and virulence, while it did not inhibit the growth rate of this pathogen. 14-Me-C16:Δ2 also reduced AHL signal production. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that 14-Me-C16:Δ2 inhibited the production of the BDSF and AHL signals by decreasing the expression of their synthase-encoding genes. Notably, 14-Me-C16:Δ2 attenuated BDSF-regulated phenotypes in various Burkholderia species. These findings suggest that 14-Me-C16:Δ2 could potentially be developed as a new therapeutic agent against pathogenic Burkholderia species by interfering with their QS signaling.IMPORTANCEBurkholderia cenocepacia is an important opportunistic pathogen which can cause life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals, particularly in cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. It usually employs two types of quorum sensing (QS) systems, including the cis-2-dodecenoic acid (BDSF) system and N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system, to regulate virulence. In this study, we have designed and identified an unsaturated fatty acid compound (cis-14-methylpentadec-2-enoic acid [14-Me-C16:Δ2]) that is capable of interfering with B. cenocepacia QS signaling and virulence. We demonstrate that 14-Me-C16:Δ2 reduced BDSF and AHL signal production in B. cenocepacia It also impaired QS-regulated phenotypes in various Burkholderia species. These results suggest that 14-Me-C16:Δ2 could interfere with QS signaling in many Burkholderia species and might be developed as a new antibacterial agent.

Transgene expression was heterogeneous within lung lobes, with expression levels that were below the detection threshold in some samples, while high in other samples. This heterogeneity is likely to be due to the bolus injection procedure as well as to the small volume of injection. The present study highlights the potential of tetrafunctional block copolymers as non-viral vectors for lung gene therapy.

We undertook Biolog Phenotype Microarray testing of P. aeruginosa CF isolates to investigate their catabolic capabilities compared to P. aeruginosa laboratory strains PAO1 and PA14. One strain, PASS4, displayed an unusual phenotype, only showing strong respiration on adenosine and inosine. Further testing indicated that PASS4 could grow on DNA as a sole carbon source, with a higher biomass production than PAO1. This suggested that PASS4 was specifically adapted to metabolize extracellular DNA, a substrate present at high concentrations in the CF lung. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of PASS4 and PAO1 when grown with DNA as a sole carbon source identified a set of upregulated genes, including virulence and host-adaptation genes. PASS4 was unable to utilize N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, and when we selected PASS4 mutants able to grow on this carbon source, they also displayed a gain in ability to catabolize a broad range of other carbon sources. Genome sequencing of the mutants revealed they all contained mutations within the purK gene, encoding a key protein in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This suggested that PASS4 was a purine auxotroph. Growth assays in the presence of 2 mM adenosine and the complementation of PASS4 with an intact purK gene confirmed this conclusion.

Whole genome sequencing indicated a single integration site on mouse chromosome 8 (8qB2) with ~6 gene copies. hCFTR+ offspring were bred to murine Cftr KO mice, producing hCFTR+/mCftr- (H+/m-) mice, which had normal survival, growth and goblet cell function as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Expression studies showed hCFTR protein and transcripts in tissues typically expressing mCftr. Functionally, nasal potential difference and large intestinal short-circuit (Isc) responses to cAMP stimulation were similar in magnitude to WT mice, whereas small intestinal cAMP ΔIsc responses were reduced. A BAC transgenic mouse with functional hCFTR under control of its regulatory elements has been developed to enable the generation of mouse models of hCFTR mutations by gene editing for in vivo testing of new CF therapies.

"	"For children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) suffering from acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), abdominal pain can be severe, difficult to treat, impair their quality of life, affect participation at school, and can lead to chronic opioid dependence. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is an uncommon treatment that is reserved for refractory cases of ARP. We present a case of a 4 year old female with pancreatic-sufficient CF, refractory ARP, frequent hospital admissions for abdominal pain, and continued growth failure despite gastrostomy tube and parenteral nutrition. One year after successful TPIAT, the patient is insulin-independent, growing well, and has not been re-hospitalized for abdominal pain. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with CF to undergo TPIAT for debilitating ARP. With CFTR modulators restoring some pancreatic function, CF clinicians should have increased vigilance for the development of ARP.

The clinical, functional, inflammatory and microbiological parameters of all transition patients were compared two years before (T-2) and two years after the transfer (T+2) from paediatric to adult centers and further analysed according to whether the transition conditions were optimal or suboptimal. Twenty-eight patients were included. The mean age at the transfer visit was 19.5 years (±3.5). There were no deaths during the study period. Consultations were more numerous at T-2 [14.5 (±5.9) vs. 12.0 (±5.1), P<0.004]. Chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequent at T+2 (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P=0.021). A progressive decrease in FEV1 and FVC was observed between T-2 and T+2. The number of pulmonary exacerbations was lower in the optimal transition group. The period of transition from childhood to adulthood in patients with CF appears to be associated with functional and microbiological changes.

32096543	"Noncanonical Wnt planar cell polarity signaling in lung development and disease
"	"The planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway is a potent developmental regulator of directional cell behaviors such as migration, asymmetric division and morphological polarization that are critical for shaping the body axis and the complex three-dimensional architecture of tissues and organs. PCP is considered a noncanonical Wnt pathway due to the involvement of Wnt ligands and Frizzled family receptors in the absence of the beta-catenin driven gene expression observed in the canonical Wnt cascade. At the heart of the PCP mechanism are protein complexes capable of generating molecular asymmetries within cells along a tissue-wide axis that are translated into polarized actin and microtubule cytoskeletal dynamics. PCP has emerged as an important regulator of developmental, homeostatic and disease processes in the respiratory system. It acts along other signaling pathways to create the elaborately branched structure of the lung by controlling the directional protrusive movements of cells during branching morphogenesis. PCP operates in the airway epithelium to establish and maintain the orientation of respiratory cilia along the airway axis for anatomically directed mucociliary clearance. It also regulates the establishment of the pulmonary vasculature. In adult tissues, PCP dysfunction has been linked to a variety of chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, stemming chiefly from the breakdown of proper tissue structure and function and aberrant cell migration during regenerative wound healing. A better understanding of these (impaired) PCP mechanisms is needed to fully harness the therapeutic opportunities of targeting PCP in chronic lung diseases.

These consensus guidelines provide recommendations to the CF community on management of both common and unique issues that arise when individuals reach a state of ACFLD. The CF Foundation assembled a multidisciplinary expert panel consisting of three workgroups: Pulmonary management; Management of comorbid conditions; Symptom management and psychosocial issues. Topics were excluded if the management considerations did not differ in ACFLD from in the overall CF population or if already addressed in other published guidelines. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review combined with expert opinion when appropriate. The committee formulated twenty-three recommendation statements specific to ACFLD that address the definition of ACFLD, pulmonary and intensive care unit management, management of selected comorbidities, symptom control, and psychosocial issues. These recommendations are intended to be paired with previously published management guidelines for the overall CF population, with the objective of reducing practice variability and improving overall care, quality of life, and survival in those with ACFLD.

"	"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a superfamily of 48 structurally similar membrane transporters that mediate the ATP-dependent cellular export of a plethora of endogenous and xenobiotic substances. Importantly, genetic variants in ABC genes that affect gene function have clinically important effects on drug disposition and can be predictors of the risk of adverse drug reactions and efficacy of chemotherapeutics, calcium channel blockers, and protease inhibitors. Furthermore, loss-of-function of ABC transporters is associated with a variety of congenital disorders. Despite their clinical importance, information about the frequencies and global distribution of functionally relevant ABC variants is limited and little is known about the overall genetic complexity of this important gene family. Here, we systematically mapped the genetic landscape of the entire human ABC superfamily using Next-Generation Sequencing data from 138,632 individuals across seven major populations. Overall, we identified 62,793 exonic variants, 98.5% of which were rare. By integrating five computational prediction algorithms with structural mapping approaches using experimentally determined crystal structures, we found that the functional ABC variability is extensive and highly population-specific. Every individual harbored between 9.3 and 13.9 deleterious ABC variants, 76% of which were found only in a single population. Carrier rates of pathogenic variants in ABC transporter genes associated with autosomal recessive congenital diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or pseudoxanthoma elasticum, closely mirrored the corresponding population-specific disease prevalence, thus providing a novel resource for rare disease epidemiology. Combined, we provide the most comprehensive, systematic, and consolidated overview of ethnogeographic ABC transporter variability with important implications for personalized medicine, clinical genetics, and precision public health.

The aim of this study was to analyze comprehensively all mutations in the CFTR gene in Serbian patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and to use the findings to propose a testing algorithm for the Serbian population. Materials and Methods: Cascade screening was employed to detect mutations in the CFTR gene of 90 patients suspected of having CF, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR-mediated site directed mutagenesis, Sanger sequencing, and/or next-generation sequencing. Results: This is the first report for the Serbian CF population where single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions, large genome rearrangements, and copy number variants were analyzed in detail. A high degree of heterogeneity within the CFTR was documented among our cohort of 90 patients. We identified 19 CF-causing mutations and 3 with varying consequences, including a previously unreported deletion of the entire exon 11. Conclusion: Considering the spectrum and frequency of mutations found, we recommend a multistep sequencing algorithm in combination with evaluation of large rearrangements for future analyses of the CFTR gene in the Serbian population.

However, the activity of AMPs against the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise the anti-Aspergillus activity of specific human AMPs, and to determine whether A. fumigatus can possess resistance to specific AMPs, as a result of in-host adaptation. AMPs were tested against a wide range of clinical isolates of various origins (including cystic fibrosis patients, as well as patients with chronic and acute aspergillosis). We also tested a series of isogenic A. fumigatus isolates obtained from a single patient over a period of 2 years. A range of environmental isolates, obtained from soil in Scotland, was also included. Firstly, the activity of specific peptides was assessed against hyphae using a measure of fungal metabolic activity. Secondly, the activity of specific peptides was assessed against germinating conidia, using imaging flow cytometry as a measure of hyphal growth. We showed that lysozyme and histones inhibited hyphal metabolic activity in all the A. fumigatus isolates tested in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, imaging flow cytometry revealed that histones, β-defensin-1 and lactoferrin inhibited the germination of A. fumigatus conidia.

"	"Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from a progressive, often fatal lung disease, which is based on a complex interplay between chronic infections, locally accumulating immune cells and pulmonary tissue remodeling. Although group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) act as crucial initiators of lung inflammation, our understanding of their involvement in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis remains incomplete. Here we report a marked decrease of circulating CCR6+ ILC2s in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients, which significantly correlated with high disease severity and advanced pulmonary failure, strongly implicating increased ILC2 homing from the peripheral blood to the chronically inflamed lung tissue in cystic fibrosis patients. On a functional level, the CCR6 ligand CCL20 was identified as potent promoter of lung-directed ILC2 migration upon inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo using a new humanized mouse model with light-sheet fluorescence microscopic visualization of lung-accumulated human ILC2s. In the lung, blood-derived human ILC2s were able to augment local eosinophil and neutrophil accumulation and induced a marked upregulation of pulmonary type-VI collagen expression. Studies in primary human lung fibroblasts additionally revealed ILC2-derived IL-4 and IL-13 as important mediators of this type-VI collagen-inducing effect. Taken together, the here acquired results suggest that pathologically increased CCL20 levels in cystic fibrosis airways induce CCR6-mediated lung homing of circulating human ILC2s. Subsequent ILC2 activation then triggers local production of type-VI collagen and might thereby drive extracellular matrix remodeling potentially influencing pulmonary tissue destruction in cystic fibrosis patients. Thus, modulating the lung homing capacity of circulating ILC2s and their local effector functions opens new therapeutic avenues for cystic fibrosis treatment.

The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) represents bacterial species with high similarity, which can cause severe infections among cases suffering from the chronic granulomatous disorder and cystic fibrosis (CF). At present, no genome-wide study has been carried out focusing on investigating the core genome of Bcc associated with the two evolutionary forces. The general characteristics of the core genome of Bcc species remain scarce as well. In this study, we explored the core orthologous genes of 116 Bcc strains using comparative genomic analysis and studied the two adaptive evolutionary forces: recombination and positive selection. We estimated 1005 orthogroups consisting entirely of single copy genes. These single copy orthologous genes in some Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) categories showed significant differences in the comparison of several evolutionary properties, and the encoding proteins were relatively simple and compact. Our findings showed that 5.8% of the core orthologous genes strongly supported recombination; in the meantime, 1.1% supported positive selection. We found that genes involved in protein synthesis as well as material transport and metabolism are favored by selection pressure. More importantly, homologous recombination contributed more genetic variation to a large number of genes and largely maintained the genetic cohesion in Bcc. This high level of recombination between Bcc species blurs their taxonomic boundaries, which leads Bcc species to be difficult or impossible to distinguish phenotypically and genotypically.

"	"The importance of the host inflammatory response, as a central pathological feature of cystic fibrosis, is well recognized. Additionally, hyperglycemia can induce an immune response and consecutively may exacerbate symptoms of this disease. Hence, adherence to a low glycemic index diet, through normalizing blood glucose levels, may reduce inflammation in patients with this disease. This study aimed to compare effects of a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet and routine high-fat, high-calorie diet on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with cystic fibrosis. In this randomized clinical trial, 44 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive for three months either a high-fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) with similar calorie and macronutrients composition to the control diet. Patients in first arm were allowed to use all sources of carbohydrates with different glycemic indices, whereas those in another arm consumed carbohydrates from low glycemic index sources. Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17A, and IFNγ, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured at baseline and after the end of the trial. There were significant differences between groups for IL-6 (P = 0.02) and IL-17 (P = 0.01), in favor of the low glycemic diet, but no between-group differences were detected in IL-10 and IFN-γ. Although serum levels of IL-17 were reduced in both the groups as compared with the baseline values, this reduction was only significant in the group assigned to the low glycemic diet (P= 0.007), In addition, IL-6 serum levels decreased and those of IL-10 increased significantly as compared with the baseline values in the low glycemic diet (P= 0.01). It seems that adherence to a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet for three months can improve some inflammatory biomarkers in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis compared with the high-fat, high-calorie diet.

A total of 216 non-CF patients with BCC bacteremia were identified. Most cases were hospital-acquired (79.2%), and the most common source was a central venous catheter (CVC) (42.1%). The rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and piperacillin-tazobactam of BCC isolates were high as 92.8% and 90.3%, respectively. The rates of susceptibility to ceftazidime, meropenem, and levofloxacin were 75.5%, 72.3%, and 64.1%, respectively.

Currently available disease-modifying CF drugs work by rescuing the function of the mutated CFTR anion channel. Recent research has shown that membrane lipids, and the cell lipidome in general, play a significant role in the mechanism of CFTR-defective trafficking and, on the other hand, its rescue. In this paper, by using untargeted lipidomics on CFBE41o- cells, we identified distinctive changes in the bronchial epithelial cell lipidome associated with treatment with Trikafta and other CF drugs. Particularly interesting was the reduction of levels of ceramide, a known molecular player in the induction of apoptosis, which appeared to be associated with a decrease in the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis. This evidence could account for additional beneficial roles of the triple combination of drugs on CF phenotypes.

In CF, inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) improves lung function and produces sustained increases in mucociliary clearance (MCC). We hypothesised that administration of HS (7% NaCl) twice daily for 2 weeks would improve clinical outcomes and produce sustained increases in MCC in COPD subjects with a chronic bronchitis (CB) phenotype. Twenty-two CB subjects completed a double-blinded, crossover study comparing inhaled HS to a hypotonic control solution (0.12% saline) administered via nebuliser twice daily for 2 weeks. Treatment order was randomised. During each treatment period, symptoms and spirometry were measured. MCC was measured at baseline, shortly after initial study agent administration, and approximately 12 h after the final dose. HS was safe and well tolerated but overall produced no significant improvements in spirometry or patient-reported outcomes. CB subjects had slower baseline MCC than healthy subjects. The MCC rates over 60 min (Ave60Clr) in CB subjects following 2 weeks of HS were not different from 0.12% saline but were slower than baseline (Ave60Clr was 9.1±6.3% at baseline versus 5.3±6.9% after HS; p<0.05). Subgroup analyses determined that subjects with residual baseline central lung clearance (14 subjects) had improved spirometry and symptoms following treatment with HS, but not 0.12% saline, treatment. Inhaled HS appeared to be safe in a general CB population. A specific phenotypic subgroup may benefit from HS but requires additional study.

"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most common pathogens colonizing the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain LPS and other virulence factors that modulate the host's innate immune response, leading to an increased local proinflammatory response and reduced pathogen clearance, resulting in chronic infection and ultimately poor patient outcomes. Lung macrophages are the first line of defense in the airway innate immune response to pathogens. Proper host response to bacterial infection requires communication between APC and T cells, ultimately leading to pathogen clearance. In this study, we investigate whether EVs secreted from P. aeruginosa alter MHC Ag expression in lung macrophages, thereby potentially contributing to decreased pathogen clearance. Primary lung macrophages from human subjects were collected via bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to EVs isolated from P. aeruginosa in vitro. Gene expression was measured with the NanoString nCounter gene expression assay. DNA methylation was measured with the EPIC array platform to assess changes in methylation. P. aeruginosa EVs suppress the expression of 11 different MHC-associated molecules in lung macrophages. Additionally, we show reduced DNA methylation in a regulatory region of gene complement factor B (CFB) as the possible driving mechanism of widespread MHC gene suppression. Our results demonstrate MHC molecule downregulation by P. aeruginosa-derived EVs in lung macrophages, which is consistent with an immune evasion strategy employed by a prokaryote in a host-pathogen interaction, potentially leading to decreased pulmonary bacterial clearance.

Here, we demonstrate that BcCVs and MIICs have overlapping features and that interferon-gamma-activated macrophages infected with B. cenocepacia can process bacterial antigens for presentation by class II MHC molecules to CD4+ T-cells and by class I MHC molecules to CD8+ T-cells. Infected macrophages also release processed bacterial peptides into the extracellular medium, stabilizing empty class I MHC molecules of bystander cells. Together, we conclude that BcCVs acquire MIIC characteristics, supporting the notion that macrophages infected with B. cenocepacia contribute to establishing an adaptive immune response against the pathogen.

32900780	"How can we relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis? An international qualitative survey
"	"Relieving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was identified as a 'top ten' priority by our James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership in cystic fibrosis (CF). We conducted an online survey to find out more about the effect of GI symptoms in CF. We co-produced an online survey distributed to the CF community via web-based platforms. The survey consisted of open and closed questions designed to help us learn more about the effects of GI symptoms for people with CF (pwCF). We analysed the data using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. We promoted the survey via social media and web-based platforms which allowed respondents from any country to take part. Our participants came from the CF community, including: adults and children with CF, parents and close family of pwCF and healthcare professionals (HCPs) working with pwCF. There were 276 respondents: 90 (33%) pwCF, 79 (29%) family, 107 (39%) HCPs. The most commonly reported symptoms by lay respondents were stomach cramps/pain, bloating and a 'combination of symptoms'. The top three symptoms that HCPs said were reported to them were reduced appetite, bloating and constipation. Almost all (94% (85/90)) HCPs thought medications helped to relieve GI symptoms but only 58% (82/141) of lay respondents agreed. Our survey has shown that GI symptoms among our participants are prevalent and intrude on daily lives of pwCF. There is a need for well-designed clinical studies to provide better evidence for management of GI symptoms and complications.

32923987	"Pendrin stimulates a chloride absorption pathway to increase CFTR-mediated chloride secretion from Cystic Fibrosis airway epithelia
"	"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an inherited multi-system disease, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that disrupt its ability to secrete anions from epithelia. Recovery of functional anion secretion may be curative for CF, so different components of the ion transport machinery have become attractive therapeutic targets. Several members of the SLC26 ion transporter family have been linked to epithelial ion flux, some through putative functional interactions with CFTR. Using a small-scale qPCR screen, we confirmed that the anion transporter SLC26A4 (pendrin) is downregulated in CF. Upregulation of pendrin using interleukins IL-4 or IL-13 increased Cl- secretion through CFTR in human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) derived epithelia differentiated in vitro and measured in the Ussing Chamber. Inhibition or knockdown of pendrin prevented this increased secretion. Increased CFTR activity was not driven by increases in CFTR protein or upstream regulatory pathway components. When basolateral Cl- absorption through NKCC1 was inhibited, a pendrin-dependent Cl- absorption pathway allowing CFTR to continue secreting Cl- from the epithelium was revealed. Although CFTR is often considered the bottleneck in the transepithelial Cl- transport pathway, these studies indicate that basolateral Cl- permeability becomes limiting as CFTR activity increases. Therefore, an increase of epithelial Cl- absorption via pendrin might have additional therapeutic benefit in combination with CFTR modulators.

32973305	"Rheological analysis of sputum from patients with chronic bronchial diseases
"	"Bronchial diseases are characterised by the weak efficiency of mucus transport through the lower airways, leading in some cases to the muco-obstruction of bronchi. It has been hypothesised that this loss of clearance results from alterations in the mucus rheology, which are reflected in sputum samples collected from patients, making sputum rheology a possible biophysical marker of these diseases and their evolution. However, previous rheological studies have focused on quasi-static viscoelastic (linear storage and loss moduli) properties only, which are not representative of the mucus mobilisation within the respiratory tract. In this paper, we extend this approach further, by analysing both quasi-static and some dynamic (flow point) properties, to assess their usability and relative performance in characterising several chronic bronchial diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis) and distinguishing them from healthy subjects. We demonstrate that pathologies influence substantially the linear and flow properties. Linear moduli are weakly condition-specific and even though the corresponding ranges overlap, distinct levels can be identified. This directly relates to the specific mucus structure in each case. In contrast, the flow point is found to strongly increase in muco-obstructive diseases, which may reflect the complete failure of mucociliary clearance causing episodic obstructions. These results suggest that the analysis of quasi-static and dynamic regimes in sputum rheology is in fact useful as these regimes provide complementary markers of chronic bronchial diseases.

"	"Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that mostly affects the sweat glands, respiratory system, digestive system, and reproductive system. Many and various types of mutations have been reported in CFTR in different ethnicities and countries/regions. Analysis of CFTR gene rearrangements is recommended in patients with unidentified mutated alleles in CFTR sequencing analysis. We collected MLPA analyses of 527 patients from Turkey who had at least one unidentified mutation in CFTR sequence analysis. Heterozygous/homozygous deletions were detected in the CFTR gene in 49 individuals (9.2%) from 35 families. Twelve different single/multi exon deletions were demonstrated, two of which were not previously reported in the literature. Mutations have previously reported in patients from various regions including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and Turkey is located at a crossroads between them. The most frequent mutation was the exon 2 deletion, accounting for 60%. Moreover, patients with exon 2 deletions, were especially originated from northern Turkey. This finding is valuable in leading and shaping planned screening programs in Turkey. Our study, the most comprehensive study for rearrangement analysis in patients from Tukey, revealed a candidate hotspot region of patients suspected of having CFTR-related disorders from Turkey.

"	"Regular physical activity (PA) is a valued part of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Although the accelerometer, SenseWear Armband (SWA), accurately measures habitual PA in CF, it is mostly used for research purposes. For the first time, we analyzed different methods of measuring PA in daily life by the use of smartphones and other electronic devices such as smartwatch and Fitbit. Twenty-four stable adults with CF (mean age 37.5 ± 11.5SD yrs.; FEV1 58 ± 19% predicted, BMI 22.9 ± 3.2) were studied. Daily PA was monitored for seven consecutive days. All patients wore the accelerometer SWA and at the same time they monitored PA with the electronic device they used routinely. They were allocated into one of four arms according to their device: Smartwatch, Fitbit, Android smartphones and iOS smartphones. PA related measurements included: duration of PA, energy expenditure, number of steps. There was a good agreement between SWA and Fitbit for number of steps (p = 0.605) and energy expenditure (p = 0.143). iOS smartphones were similar to SWA in monitoring the number of steps (p = 0.911). Significant differences were found between SWA and both Smartwatch and Android smartphones. Fitbit and iOS smartphones seem to be a valuable approach to monitor daily PA. They provide a good performance to measure step number compared to SWA.

"	"Pulmonary exacerbation is the most common acute event occurring in a patient with cystic fibrosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most commonly involved organism. Azithromycin has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects on the lungs and our study aimed to determine the role of long-term intermittent use of oral azithromycin on pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016 at a tertiary care hospital, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. The criteria for enrolment included cystic fibrosis patients aged 3-18 years who were classified into two groups based on their antibiotic use. The Azithromycin group included those CF patients who were on three days per week oral Azithromycin (10 mg per Kg per day) for 6 months. The non-azithromycin group included CF patients who were not on long term oral azithromycin. Our primary outcome was to assess the reduction in the number of exacerbations. Sixty-three patients with a mean age (10.06±3.80) and mean pulmonary exacerbations of (3.67±1.58) in the 6 months before enrolment were included in our study. Out of these, 30 patients were included in the azithromycin group and 33 patients in the non-azithromycin group. Overall, 180 exacerbations were documented during the study period. The one-way ANOVA (F (1,61) =8.033, p<0.05) demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the mean number of exacerbations between the azithromycin (2.70±1.72) and non-azithromycin group (3.81±1.40) however, the mean length of stay between the groups was not significant (p=0.582). P. aeruginosa was found to be the most predominant colonizer of the airways. Long term low dose azithromycin therapy is beneficial in young patients with cystic fibrosis. It is an effective prevention strategy for pulmonary exacerbations.

In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 26 episodes (25 patients) with P. aeruginosa infection admitted to two CF centres for treatment of an acute pulmonary exacerbation were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg CaEDTA in Tris-buffered saline or placebo (Tris-buffered saline) nebulised in combination with 250 mg tobramycin twice daily for six weeks followed with four week safety follow-up. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and bacterial density of P. aeruginosa. A secondary endpoint was lung function. The study drug was well tolerated with adverse events comparable in both groups. The mean (SD) reduction in sputum P. aeruginosa count (log10 CFU/g) in the CaEDTA vs placebo group was 2·05 (2·57) vs 0·82 (2·71) at two weeks relative to admission (p = 0·39).

In 2017, the Global Lung Function Initiative published new reference values (GLI-2017) for DLCO, alveolar volume (VA) and transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide (KCO). We aimed to assess the applicability of GLI-2017 reference values for DLCO on a large population by comparing them to the European Community of Steel and Coal equations of 1993 (ECSC-93) widely used. In this retrospective study, spirometric indices, total lung capacity, DLCO, VA and KCO were measured in adults classified in 5 groups (controls, asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial lung diseases (ILD)). Statistical analysis comparing the 2 equations sets were stratified by sex. 4180 tests were included. GLI-2017 z-scores of the 3 DLCO indices of the controls (n = 150) are nearer to 0 (expected value in a normal population) than ECSC-93 z-scores. All groups combined, in both genders, DLCO GLI-2017 z-scores and %predicted are significantly higher than ECSC z-scores and %predicted. In the ILD group, differences between the 2 equation sets depend on the DLCO impairment severity: GLI-2017 z-scores are higher than ECSC z-scores in patients with no or ""mild"" decrease in DLCO, but are lower in ""moderate"" or ""severe"" decrease. GLI-2017 reference values for DLCO are more suitable to our population and influence the diagnostic criteria and severity definition of several lung diseases.

The aim of our study was to determine the impact of simple advice provided by the pediatrician on the smoking habits of parents of children with cystic fibrosis (CF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Parents were interviewed on their smoking habits. Smoking cessation advice was provided by the pediatrician. A new smoking habits assessment was done at 3 months by phone interviews. A total of 260 parents were interviewed (91 in the CF group, 136 in the DM group, and 33 in the bronchiolitis group). A total of 70 parents were active smokers: 33% of parents of children with CF, 23.5% of parents of children with DM, and 24.2% for those with infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis (p = .42). In the CF group, smoking cessation had been significantly more frequently discussed with the medical team previously. A total of 67 smoking parents (95.7%) answered the 3-month assessment: 29.8% reported having started a smoking cessation process; 10.4% had quit smoking. The quitting rate was significantly higher in the groups of patients followed for a respiratory disorder (37.5% for bronchiolitis, 15% for CF vs. 0% for DM, p = .005). This study shows the important role that information and simple advice from pediatricians can have in initiating smoking cessation in parents of patients followed in specialized clinics or who are hospitalized, with a greater efficiency in parents of patients suffering from lung disorders.

Epidemiological and clinical data were described, and standardized mortality rates were calculated per year and for the 2000-2017 period. A joinpoint regression analysis was performed to detect changes in the mortality rates during the study period. Overall, 2,854 CF-related deaths were identified during the study period, ranging from 68 in 1999 to 289 in 2017. CF was the underlying cause of death in 83.5% of the death certificates. A continuous upward trend in the death rates was observed, with a significant annual percent change of 6.84% (5.3-8.4%) among males and 7.50% (6.6-8.4%) among females. The median age at death increased from 7.5 years in 1999 to 56.5 years in 2017. Diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 77% of the associated causes in the death certificates that reported CF as the underlying cause of death. A significant and continuous increase in CF-related death rates was found in Brazil in the last years, as well as a concurrent increase in the median age at death.

In this work we produced Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles (GPMVs) from a bronchial epithelial cell line and validated their use as a cell-like alternative to investigate the steps involved in the adhesion process of B. cenocepacia. RNA-sequencing was performed and the analysis of the B. cenocepacia K56-2 transcriptome after the first contacts with the surface of host cells allowed the recognition of genes implicated in bacterial adaptation and virulence-associated functions. The sensing of host membranes led to a transcriptional shift that caused a cascade of metabolic and physiological adaptations to the host specific environment. Many of the differentially expressed genes encode proteins related with central metabolic pathways, transport systems, cellular processes, and virulence traits. The understanding of the changes in gene expression that occur in the early steps of infection can uncover new proteins implicated in B. cenocepacia-host cell adhesion, against which new blocking agents could be designed to control the progression of the infectious process.

"	"The emergence of antibiotic tolerance was a tricky problem in the treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected cystic fibrosis and burn victims. The quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor may serve as a new tactic for the bacterial resistance by inhibiting the biofilm formation and the production of virulence factors. This study explored the potential of luteolin as a QS inhibitor against P. aeruginosa and the molecular mechanism involved. Crystal violet staining, CLSM observation, and SEM analysis were carried out to assess the effect of luteolin on biofilm formation. The motility assays and the production of virulence factors were determined to evaluate the QS-inhibitory activity of luteolin. Acyl-homoserine lactone, RT-PCR, and molecular docking assays were conducted to explain its anti-QS mechanisms. The biofilm formation, the production of virulence factors, and the motility of P. aeruginosa could be efficiently inhibited by luteolin. Luteolin could also attenuate the accumulation of the QS-signaling molecules N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) (P < 0.01) and downregulate the transcription levels of QS genes (lasR, lasI, rhlR, and rhlI) (P < 0.01). Molecular docking analysis indicated that luteolin had a greater docking affinity with LasR regulator protein compared with OdDHL. This study is important as it reports the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-biofilm formation activity of luteolin against P. aeruginosa. This study also indicated that luteolin could be helpful when used for the treatment of clinical drug-resistant infections of P. aeruginosa.

However, the exact function of CFTR on human sperm fertilizing capacity, and correlation with sperm quality has not been established. The present study may shed light on some unexplained male infertility, and on a possible new method for diagnosis of male infertility and strategy for male contraception. To assess the effect of CFTR on human sperm fertilizing capacity, we examined sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction using chlortetracycline staining, analyzed sperm hyperactivation by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA), measured intracellular cAMP levels using ElA and evaluated sperm penetration of zona-free hamster eggs assay in fertile men. The percentage of spermatozoa expressing CFTR from fertile, healthy and infertile men (mainly teratospermic, asthenoteratospermic, asthenospermic and oligospermic) was conducted by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Progesterone significantly facilitated human sperm capacitation and ZP3 triggered the acrosome reaction, both were significantly inhibited by CFTR inhibitor-172 (CFTRinh-172; 10 nM-1 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of 100 nM CFTRinh-172 markedly depressed intracellular cAMP levels, sperm hyperactivation and sperm penetration of zona-free hamster eggs. In addition, the percentage of spermatozoa expressing CFTR in the fertile men was significantly higher than healthy and infertile men categories (P < 0.01). CFTR is essential for human sperm fertilizing capacity and the impairment of CFTR expression in spermatozoa is correlated with a reduction of sperm quality. These results suggest that defective expression of CFTR in human sperm may lead to the reduction of sperm fertilizing capacity.

We compared two processing mutants: DeltaF508 and the ER exit code mutant DAA. Although both have severe kinetic processing defect, DAA but not DeltaF508 has substantial accumulation in its mature form, leading to higher level of processing at the steady state. DAA has much less profound conformational abnormalities. It has lower Hsp70 association and higher post-ER stability than DeltaF508. The ER exit code is necessary for DeltaF508 residual export and rescue. R555K, a mutation that rescues DeltaF508 misprocessing, improves Sec24 association and enhances its post-ER stability. Using in situ limited proteolysis, we demonstrated a clear change in trypsin sensitivity in DeltaF508 NBD1, which is reversed, together with that of other domains, by low temperature, R555K or both. We observed a conversion of the proteolytic pattern of DAA from the one resembling DeltaF508 to the one similar to wild-type CFTR during its maturation. Low temperature and R555K are additive in improving DeltaF508 conformational maturation and processing. Our data reveal a dual contribution of ER exit code and domain conformation to CFTR misprocessing and underscore the importance of conformational repair in effective rescue of DeltaF508.

Recent studies indicate another important function of transport of ions and electrolytes - establishing wound electric fields that guide cell migration. We found chloride (Cl(-)) flux is a major component of the corneal wound electric current. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of Cl(-) transport, we studied Cl(-) channels and transporters in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. We tested a transformed human corneal epithelial cell line (tHCE), primary cultures of human corneal epithelial cells (pHCE), and human donor corneas. We first used RT-PCR to determine expression levels of mRNA of CLC (Cl(-) channels/transporters of CLC gene family) family members and CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) in HCE cells. We then confirmed protein expression and distribution of selected CLC family members and CFTR with Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Finally, Cl(-) currents were recorded with electrophysiological techniques. The mRNAs of CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-5, CLC-6, and CFTR were detected in the HCE cell line. CLC-1 and CLC-7 were not detectable. Western blot and immunostaining confirmed protein expression and distribution of CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6 and CFTR in human corneal epithelium. CLC-2 preferentially labeled the apical and basal layers, while CLC-3 and CLC-4 labeled only the superficial layer. CLC-6 and CFTR labeling showed a unique gradient with strong staining in apical layers which gradually decreased towards the basal layers. Corneal endothelium was positive for CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6 and possibly CFTR. Human corneal epithelial cells demonstrated voltage dependent Cl(-) currents. HCE cells express functional Cl(-) channels and transporters. CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6, and CFTR had distinct expression patterns in human corneal epithelium. Those molecules and their distribution may play important roles in maintaining resting Cl(-) fluxes and in regulating Cl(-) flux at corneal wounds, which may be a major contributor to wound electrical signaling.

"	"Throughout the body, the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) plays a critical role in salt and liquid homeostasis. In cystic fibrosis airways, for instance, improper regulation of ENaC results in hyperabsorption of sodium that causes dehydration of airway surface liquid. This dysregulation then contributes to mucus stasis and chronic lung infections. ENaC is known to undergo proteolytic cleavage, which is required for its ability to conduct Na(+) ions. We have previously shown that the short, palate lung and nasal epithelial clone (SPLUNC1) binds to and inhibits ENaC in both airway epithelia and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In this study, we found that SPLUNC1 was more potent at inhibiting ENaC than either SPLUNC2 or long PLUNC1 (LPLUNC1), two other PLUNC family proteins that are also expressed in airway epithelia. Furthermore, we were able to shed light on the potential mechanism of SPLUNC1's inhibition of ENaC. While SPLUNC1 did not inhibit proteolytic activity of trypsin, it significantly reduced ENaC currents by reducing the number of ENaCs in the plasma membrane. A better understanding of ENaC's regulation by endogenous inhibitors may aid in the development of novel therapies designed to inhibit hyperactive ENaC in cystic fibrosis epithelia.

"	"Investigation of microbial communities, particularly human associated communities, is significantly enhanced by the vast amounts of sequence data produced by high throughput sequencing technologies. However, these data create high-dimensional complex data sets that consist of a large proportion of zeros, non-negative skewed counts, and frequently, limited number of samples. These features distinguish sequence data from other forms of high-dimensional data, and are not adequately addressed by statistical approaches in common use. Ultimately, medical studies may identify targeted interventions or treatments, but lack of analytic tools for feature selection and identification of taxa responsible for differences between groups, is hindering advancement. The objective of this paper is to examine the application of a two-part statistic to identify taxa that differ between two groups. The advantages of the two-part statistic over common statistical tests applied to sequence count datasets are discussed. Results from the t-test, the Wilcoxon test, and the two-part test are compared using sequence counts from microbial ecology studies in cystic fibrosis and from cenote samples. We show superior performance of the two-part statistic for analysis of sequence data. The improved performance in microbial ecology studies was independent of study type and sequence technology used.

21966295	"Immunopathology and immunogenetics of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
"	"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a Th2 hypersensitivity lung disease in response to Aspergillus fumigatus that affects asthmatic and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Sensitization to A. fumigatus is common in both atopic asthmatic and CF patients, yet only 1%-2% of asthmatic and 7%-9% of CF patients develop ABPA. ABPA is characterized by wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates which may lead to pulmonary fibrosis and/or bronchiectasis. The inflammatory response is characterized by Th2 responses to Aspergillus allergens, increased serum IgE, and eosinophilia. A number of genetic risks have recently been identified in the development of ABPA. These include HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4RA) polymorphisms, IL-10 -1082GA promoter polymorphisms, surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) polymorphisms, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations. The studies indicate that ABPA patients are genetically at risk to develop skewed and heightened Th2 responses to A. fumigatus antigens. These genetic risk studies and their consequences of elevated biologic markers may aid in identifying asthmatic and CF patients who are at risk to the development of ABPA. Furthermore, these studies suggest that immune modulation with medications such as anti-IgE, anti-IL-4, and/or IL-13 monoclonal antibodies may be helpful in the treatment of ABPA.

22174830	"Neutrophil elastase enhances sputum solubilization in cystic fibrosis patients receiving DNase therapy
"	"Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from chronic lung infection and inflammation due to the secretion of viscous sputum. Sputum viscosity is caused by extracellular DNA, some of which originates from the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). During NET formation neutrophil elastase (NE) partially processes histones to decondense chromatin. NE is abundant in CF sputum and is thought to contribute to tissue damage. Exogenous nucleases are a palliative treatment in CF as they promote sputum solubilization. We show that in a process reminiscent of NET formation, NE enhances sputum solubilization by cleaving histones to enhance the access of exogenous nucleases to DNA. In addition, we find that in Cf sputum NE is predominantly bound to DNA, which is known to downregulate its proteolytic activity and may restrict host tissue damage. The beneficial role of NE in CF sputum solubilization may have important implications for the development of CF therapies targeting NE.

22194755	"The Novel CFTR Mutation A457P in a Male with a Delayed Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that may be caused by more than 1000 different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We describe the case of a CF patient who was initially diagnosed at 16 years of age after presenting with mild respiratory compromise and pancreatic sufficiency. When genetic testing was first performed using a CF mutation panel, only a single F508del CFTR allele was identified. We subsequently performed testing, which revealed a previously unreported mutation: A457P (p.Ala457Pro, c.1369G>C). The patient's clinical course through adulthood is described, and genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed. The A457P mutation appears to confer a relatively mild phenotype, as is usually observed with CFTR class IV-VI defects. With the advent of more comprehensive and widely available genetic testing techniques, identification of CF genotypes in patients with milder disease variants may help stratify patients for targeted therapy and prevent late complications of the disease.

22298109	"MudPIT analysis of released proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa laboratory and clinical strains in relation to pro-inflammatory effects
"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most common virulent pathogen contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF). During bacterial lung colonization, the products of its metabolism are released in the extracellular space contributing to the pathogenic events associated with its presence. To gain insights on the mechanisms involved in the Pa pathogenesis we focused our attention on proteins released by Pa using a MudPIT approach combined with cell biology assays. Conditioned medium (CM) collected under aerobic and microaerobic conditions from Pa clinical strains (in early and late colonization), unlike the laboratory strain, induced expression of IL-8 mRNA in CF airway epithelial cells. We have identified proteins released by clinically relevant Pa strains, focusing on the pro-inflammatory effects as metalloproteases (MMPs). In fact, their expression pattern was associated with the highest pro-inflammatory activity measured in the early clinically isolated strain. The relation was further supported by the result of the analysis of a larger and independent set of Pa isolates derived from sporadically and chronically infected CF patients: 76% of sporadic samples expressed protease activity (n = 44), while only 27% scored positive in the chronically infected individuals (n = 38, p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Finally, looking for a possible mechanism of action of bacterial MMPs, we found that CM from early clinical isolates can cleave CXCR1 on the surface of human neutrophils, suggesting a potential role for the bacterially released MMPs in the protection of the pathogen from the host's response.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, with lung and liver manifestations. Because of pitfalls of gene therapy, novel approaches for reconstitution of the airway epithelium and CFTR expression should be explored. In the present study, human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) were isolated from term placentas and characterized for expression of phenotypic and pluripotency markers, and for differentiation potential towards mesoderm (osteogenic and adipogenic) lineages. Moreover, hAMSCs were induced to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, as demonstrated by mixed function oxidase activity and expression of albumin, alpha1-antitrypsin, and CK19. We also investigated the CFTR expression in hAMSCs upon isolation and in coculture with CF airway epithelial cells. Freshly isolated hAMSCs displayed low levels of CFTR mRNA, which even decreased with culture passages. Following staining with the vital dye CM-DiI, hAMSCs were mixed with CFBE41o- respiratory epithelial cells and seeded onto permeable filters. Flow cytometry demonstrated that 33-50% of hAMSCs acquired a detectable CFTR expression on the apical membrane, a result confirmed by confocal microscopy. Our data show that amniotic MSCs have the potential to differentiate into epithelial cells of organs relevant in CF pathogenesis and may contribute to partial correction of the CF phenotype.

22582115	"Activity and inhibition of prostasin and matriptase on apical and basolateral surfaces of human airway epithelial cells
"	"Prostasin is a membrane-anchored protease expressed in airway epithelium, where it stimulates salt and water uptake by cleaving the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). Prostasin is activated by another transmembrane tryptic protease, matriptase. Because ENaC-mediated dehydration contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF), prostasin and matriptase are potential therapeutic targets, but their catalytic competence on airway epithelial surfaces has been unclear. Seeking tools for exploring sites and modulation of activity, we used recombinant prostasin and matriptase to identify substrate t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-Gln-Ala-Arg-4-nitroanilide (QAR-4NA), which allowed direct assay of proteases in living cells. Comparisons of bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) with and without functioning cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) revealed similar levels of apical and basolateral aprotinin-inhibitable activity. Although recombinant matriptase was more active than prostasin in hydrolyzing QAR-4NA, cell surface activity resisted matriptase-selective inhibition, suggesting that prostasin dominates. Surface biotinylation revealed similar expression of matriptase and prostasin in epithelial cells expressing wild-type vs. ΔF508-mutated CFTR. However, the ratio of mature to inactive proprostasin suggested surface enrichment of active enzyme. Although small amounts of matriptase and prostasin were shed spontaneously, prostasin anchored to the cell surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol was the major contributor to observed QAR-4NA-hydrolyzing activity. For example, the apical surface of wild-type CFBE41o- epithelial cells express 22% of total, extractable, aprotinin-inhibitable, QAR-4NA-hydrolyzing activity and 16% of prostasin immunoreactivity. In conclusion, prostasin is present, mature and active on the apical surface of wild-type and CF bronchial epithelial cells, where it can be targeted for inhibition via the airway lumen.

"	"This study aimed to describe lung function in a cohort of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who underwent infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) and preschool spirometry. Children performed up to four IPFTs (raised volume rapid thoracic compression technique) over 1 yr and five preschool spirometry tests over up to 2 yrs during participation in prospective, multicentre studies of infant and preschool lung function. All lung function data were reviewed centrally for measurement acceptability. 45 children had 252 acceptable measurements (137 IPFTs and 115 preschool spirometries) at ages 0.3-6.5 yrs. The median number of measurements per participant was 6 (range 3-9). Recent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was associated with 5.1% (95% CI 0.01-9.9%) lower forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)) and 16.4% (95% CI 7.0-24.9%) lower forced expiratory flow at 25-25% of forced vital capacity (FEF(25-75%)), after adjustment for length, test type and centre. Recent cough was associated with 5.7% (95% CI 1.1-10.1%) lower FEV(0.5) and 10.1% (95% CI 0.6-18.7%) lower FEF(25-75%). Even after accounting for infection status, cough, sex, length, test type and centre, there was significant inter-individual variability in lung function (p<0.01 for each of FEV(0.5), FEF(25-75%) and forced vital capacity). Recent P. aeruginosa infection and cough are associated with lower lung function in children with CF. Significant inter-individual variability in lung function remains to be explained.

22856641	"New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance in cystic fibrosis
"	"Topical delivery of aerosolized therapies is an established treatment for chronic airway infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent developments in nebuliser technology have enabled Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) of mesh generated aerosol particles resulting in more efficient airway deposition than existing jet nebulizers. An additional feature of these new devices is the ability to record and examine the performance of the device by downloading stored data (electronic data capture). In a series of studies we have used this downloading facility to monitor treatment times and examine adherence to nebulizer therapy in our pediatric patients. We found routine adherence monitoring is possible in busy CF clinic. We have shown that good adherence to treatment can be maintained in both patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on long-term therapy, and in patients with first/new growths of Pseudomonas on short-term eradication therapy. When adherence was examined from an individual perspective, we demonstrated a wide variation both between and within individual patients. A further modification of AAD technology, Target Inhalation Mode (TIM) optimises patient inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism. This new breathing mode has also been evaluated in our pediatric CF clinic in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and we have shown that children maintain adherence to treatment through the TIM mouthpiece and average treatment times reduced from 6.9 to 3.7 min when using TIM. This is a new era of aerosol delivery and novel advances in medical devices need to be monitored and assessed rigorously, particularly as new and potentially expensive therapies emerge from translational studies. Electronic data capture enables CF teams to work in an open partnership with patients to achieve the common goals of improving drug delivery and reducing patient burden.

"	"Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication associated with fertility drugs. It is characterized by increased vascular permeability and substantial fluid shift with accumulation in the body cavity. The pathogenesis of OHSS remains obscure, and no definitive treatments are currently available. Using western blot and short-circuit current (Isc) techniques, we investigate the potential coactions of analysis in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and aquaporin 1 (AQP1) on the hyper permeability of body cavity peritoneal epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of OHSS. The rats develop OHSS symptoms, with the up regulation of both CFTR and AQP1 expression and enhanced CFTR channel activity in peritoneal epithelial cells, can also be mimicked by administration of estrogen, alone in ovariectomized rats. Administration of progesterone suppresses CFTR activity, OHSS symptoms as well as CFTR and AQP1 expression. Besides, AQP1 inhibitor, HgCl(2), can suppress CFTR channel activity. Therefore, antisera against CFTR or AQP1 to OHSS animals may result in alleviation of the symptom. This study confirms the coactions of CFTR and AQP1 play a critical role in the development and progression of increased peritoneal epithelial permeability in severe OHSS. These findings may provide grounds for ameliorating assisted reproduction treatment strategy to reduce the risk of OHSS in in vitro fertilization (IVF).

22966014	"Nonintegral stoichiometry in CFTR gating revealed by a pore-lining mutation
"	"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Unlike most other ABC proteins that function as active transporters, CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel. The opening of CFTR's gate is associated with ATP-induced dimerization of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), whereas gate closure is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis-triggered partial separation of the NBDs. This generally held theme of CFTR gating-a strict coupling between the ATP hydrolysis cycle and the gating cycle-is put to the test by our recent finding of a short-lived, post-hydrolytic state that can bind ATP and reenter the ATP-induced original open state. We accidentally found a mutant CFTR channel that exhibits two distinct open conductance states, the smaller O1 state and the larger O2 state. In the presence of ATP, the transition between the two states follows a preferred O1→O2 order, a telltale sign of a violation of microscopic reversibility, hence demanding an external energy input likely from ATP hydrolysis, as such preferred gating transition was abolished in a hydrolysis-deficient mutant. Interestingly, we also observed a considerable amount of opening events that contain more than one O1→O2 transition, indicating that more than one ATP molecule may be hydrolyzed within an opening burst. We thus conclude a nonintegral stoichiometry between the gating cycle and ATP consumption. Our results lead to a six-state gating model conforming to the classical allosteric mechanism: both NBDs and transmembrane domains hold a certain degree of autonomy, whereas the conformational change in one domain will facilitate the conformational change in the other domain.

"	"How diversity evolves and persists in biofilms is essential for understanding much of microbial life, including the uncertain dynamics of chronic infections. We developed a biofilm model enabling long-term selection for daily adherence to and dispersal from a plastic bead in a test tube. Focusing on a pathogen of the cystic fibrosis lung, Burkholderia cenocepacia, we sequenced clones and metagenomes to unravel the mutations and evolutionary forces responsible for adaptation and diversification of a single biofilm community during 1,050 generations of selection. The mutational patterns revealed recurrent evolution of biofilm specialists from generalist types and multiple adaptive alleles at relatively few loci. Fitness assays also demonstrated strong interference competition among contending mutants that preserved genetic diversity. Metagenomes from five other independently evolved biofilm lineages revealed extraordinary mutational parallelism that outlined common routes of adaptation, a subset of which was found, surprisingly, in a planktonic population. These mutations in turn were surprisingly well represented among mutations that evolved in cystic fibrosis isolates of both Burkholderia and Pseudomonas. These convergent pathways included altered metabolism of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate, polysaccharide production, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, global transcription, and iron scavenging. Evolution in chronic infections therefore may be driven by mutations in relatively few pathways also favored during laboratory selection, creating hope that experimental evolution may illuminate the ecology and selective dynamics of chronic infections and improve treatment strategies.

23757023	"Mechanosensitive ATP release maintains proper mucus hydration of airways
"	"The clearance of mucus from the airways protects the lungs from inhaled noxious and infectious materials. Proper hydration of the mucus layer enables efficient mucus clearance through beating of cilia on airway epithelial cells, and reduced clearance of excessively concentrated mucus occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Key steps in the mucus transport process are airway epithelia sensing and responding to changes in mucus hydration. We reported that extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine were important luminal autocrine and paracrine signals that regulated the hydration of the surface of human airway epithelial cultures through their action on apical membrane purinoceptors. Mucus hydration in human airway epithelial cultures was sensed by an interaction between cilia and the overlying mucus layer: Changes in mechanical strain, proportional to mucus hydration, regulated ATP release rates, adjusting fluid secretion to optimize mucus layer hydration. This system provided a feedback mechanism by which airways maintained mucus hydration in an optimum range for cilia propulsion. Understanding how airway epithelia can sense and respond to changes in mucus properties helps us to understand how the mucus clearance system protects the airways in health and how it fails in lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis.

"	"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a rare and fatal complication in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who lack concomitant risk factors. The few documented cases in children have all resulted in deaths during hospitalisation. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with CF who was admitted for an exacerbation which was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The findings on imaging raised concerns about a possible fungal infection. As a result, voriconazole therapy was started prior to his respiratory deterioration. He was later found to be β-D glucan and Aspergillus Ag galactomannan positive confirming the suspicion for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Three months after diagnosis, he was discharged home under stable condition. Voriconazole was continued beyond discharge and resulted in improvement of respiratory symptoms. This underscores the importance of early treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with CF. Unfortunately, the patient died 6 months after diagnosis from a CF exacerbation.

"	"To develop stem/progenitor cell-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, it is first necessary to identify markers of human lung epithelial progenitor/stem cells and to better understand the potential for differentiation into distinct lineages. Here we investigated integrin α6β4 as an epithelial progenitor cell marker in the human distal lung. We identified a subpopulation of α6β4(+) cells that localized in distal small airways and alveolar walls and were devoid of pro-surfactant protein C expression. The α6β4(+) epithelial cells demonstrated key properties of stem cells ex vivo as compared to α6β4(-) epithelial cells, including higher colony forming efficiency, expression of stem cell-specific transcription factor Nanog, and the potential to differentiate into multiple distinct lineages including basal and Clara cells. Co-culture of α6β4(+) epithelial cells with endothelial cells enhanced proliferation. We identified a subset of adeno-associated virus (AAVs) serotypes, AAV2 and AAV8, capable of transducing α6β4(+) cells. In addition, reconstitution of bronchi epithelial cells from CF patients with only 5% normal α6β4(+) epithelial cells significantly rescued defects in Cl(-) transport. Therefore, targeting the α6β4(+) epithelial population via either gene delivery or progenitor cell-based reconstitution represents a potential new strategy to treat CF lung disease.

"	"Understanding the importance of respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been limited because of challenges using clinic- or hospital-based diagnostic testing. We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self- (or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6-18 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of -2.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.5, -1.2; P < .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was -3.8 (95% CI -6.8, -0.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for home-collected swabs. Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.

"	"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes a wide range of infections, including chronic biofilm infections in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. We previously found that the inner-membrane protein MgtE can function both as a magnesium transporter and a virulence modulator, although the exact mechanism governing these activities is unclear. To address this issue, we carried out an experimental characterization of P. aeruginosa MgtE and generated a computer-rendered model. Our in silico analysis demonstrated the structural similarity of P. aeruginosa MgtE to that of the crystal structure of MgtE in Thermus thermophilus. Experimentally, we verified that MgtE is not essential for growth and found that it may not be involved directly in biofilm formation, even under low-magnesium conditions. We demonstrated both magnesium transport and cytotoxicity-regulating functions, and showed that magnesium-binding sites in the connecting helix region of MgtE are vital in coupling these two functions. Furthermore, limiting magnesium environments stimulated mgtE transcriptional responses. Our results suggested that MgtE might play an important role in linking magnesium availability to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.

However, the establishment and maintenance of disease registries is a burdensome initiative from economical and organisational points of view and experience sharing on registries management is important to avoid waste of resources. The aim of this paper is to discuss the problems embedded in the institution and management of an international disease registry to warn against common mistakes that can derail the best of intentions: we share the experience of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry, which collects data on almost 30,000 patients from 23 countries. We discuss the major problems that researchers often encounter in the creation and management of disease registries: definition of the aims the registry has to reach, definition of the criteria for patients referral to the registry, definition of the information to record, set up of a data quality process, handling of missing data, maintenance of data confidentiality, regulation of data use and dissemination of research results. We give examples on how many crucial aspects were solved by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry regarding objectives, inclusion criteria and variables definition, data management, data quality controls, missing data handling, confidentiality maintenance, data use and results dissemination. We suggest an extensive literature research and discussions in working groups with different stake holders, including patient representatives, on the objectives, inclusion criteria and the information to record. We propose to pilot the recording of few variables and test the applicability of their definition first. The use of a shared electronic platform for data collection that automatically computes derived variables, and automatically performs basic data quality controls is a good data management practice, that also helps in reducing missing data. We found crucial for success the collaboration with existing national and international registries, cystic fibrosis organisations and patients' associations.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in CFTR, a plasma-membrane-localized anion channel. The most common mutation in CFTR, deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508), causes misfolding of CFTR resulting in little or no protein at the plasma membrane. The CFTR corrector VX-809 shows promise for treating CF patients homozygous for ΔF508. Here, we demonstrate the significance of protein-protein interactions in enhancing the stability of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant channel protein at the plasma membrane. We determined that VX-809 prolongs the stability of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane. Using competition-based assays, we demonstrated that ΔF508 CFTR interacts poorly with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) compared to wild-type CFTR, and VX-809 significantly increased this binding affinity. We conclude that stabilized CFTR-NHERF1 interaction is a determinant of the functional efficiency of rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Our results demonstrate the importance of macromolecular-complex formation in stabilizing rescued mutant CFTR at the plasma membrane and suggest this to be foundational for the development of a new generation of effective CFTR-corrector-based therapeutics.

"	"Estrogen is known to stimulate uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretion via CFTR. This study investigated testosterone effect on these changes in a rat model. Ovariectomized adult female rats received estrogen for five days or estrogen for three days followed by two days peanut oil or testosterone either alone or in the presence of flutamide or finasteride. At the end of treatment, uteri were perfused with perfusate containing CFTRinh-172. The rate of fluid and Cl(-) secretion were determined. Dose-dependent effect of testosterone and effect of forskolin on fluid secretion rate were measured. Animals were sacrificed and uteri were removed for CFTR protein and mRNA expression analyses, histology and cAMP measurement. Morphology of uterus, levels of expression of CFTR protein and mRNA and distribution of CFTR protein were observed. Estrogen causes increase while testosterone causes decrease in uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretions. The effects of estrogen but not testosterone were antagonized by CFTRinh-172. Luminal fluid volume and apical expression of CFTR in the luminal epithelia were highest under estrogen and lowest under testosterone influences. Similar changes were observed in CFTR protein and mRNA expressions. Uterine cAMP level was highest under estrogen and lowest under testosterone influence. Forskolin increases fluid secretion rate in estrogen but not in testosterone-treated animals. Testosterone effects were dose-dependent and were antagonized by flutamide however, not finasteride. Testosterone inhibition of estrogen-induced uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretion occurs via inhibition of CFTR expression and functional activities. These changes could explain the adverse effects of testosterone on fertility.

25222606	"Effect of different breathing aids on ventilation distribution in adults with cystic fibrosis
"	"We investigated the effect of different breathing aids on ventilation distribution in healthy adults and subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). In 11 healthy adults and 9 adults with CF electrical impedance tomography measurements were performed during spontaneous breathing, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy randomly applied in upright and lateral position. Spatial and temporal ventilation distribution was assessed. The proportion of ventilation directed to the dependent lung significantly increased in lateral position compared to upright in healthy and CF. This effect was enhanced with CPAP but neutralised with PEP, whereas the effect of PEP was larger in the healthy group. Temporal ventilation distribution showed exactly the opposite with homogenisation during CPAP and increased inhomogeneity with PEP. PEP shows distinct differences to CPAP with respect to its impact on ventilation distribution in healthy adults and CF subjects EIT might be used to individualise respiratory physiotherapy.

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) Guidelines Committee on Mental Health sought the views of CF health care professionals concerning mental health care delivery. An online survey which focused on the current provision and barriers to mental health care was distributed to CF health care professionals. Of the 1454 respondents, many did not have a colleague trained in mental health issues and 20% had no one on their team whose primary role was focused on assessing or treating these issues. Insufficient resources and a lack of competency were reported in relation to mental health referrals. Seventy-three percent of respondents had no experience with mental health screening. Of those who did, they utilized 48 different, validated scales. These data have informed the decision-making, dissemination and implementation strategies of the Mental Health Guidelines Committee sponsored by the CFF and ECFS.

"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common recessive conditions among whites, with an estimated carrier frequency of 1 in 25 in the United States. Population-based CF carrier screening was implemented in the United States in 2001. The number of mutations screened by each laboratory may vary; however, the 23 most common CF mutations recommended for screening by the American College of Medical Genetics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are included in all platforms. The c.1364C>A (p.A455E) mutation located in exon 10 of the CFTR gene is one of the 23 mutations. Because CFTR exon 10 and its flanking intronic regions are duplicated and transposed onto several other chromosomes of the human genome during evolution and function as unprocessed pseudogenes, variations in the CFTR pseudogenes may confound CF screening results for mutations located in exon 10 of the CFTR gene. We report an incorrectly identified carrier status for the c.1364C>A (p.A455E) mutation in a healthy individual using the Hologic InPlex CF assay. Further analysis revealed that the mutation resides in one of the CFTR pseudogenes. Because most commercial kits and laboratory-developed tests for CF carrier screening involve a short amplicon encompassing this mutation, this finding suggests that individuals with the c.1364C>A (p.A455E) mutation may require further investigation to avoid a false assignment of CF carrier status.

"	"Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the most prevalent organism infecting the respiratory tract of CF children, and remains the second most prevalent organism in CF adults. During early childhood, SA infections are associated with pulmonary inflammation and decline in FEV1, but their clinical significance in adult CF patients is poorly characterized. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to determine the association between airway microbiology and clinical outcomes (FEV1, rate of pulmonary exacerbations, CRP levels and clinical scores). In a cohort of 84 adult CF patients, 24 % were infected with SA only, 60 % were infected with PA, and 16 % had neither PA nor SA. CF patients with SA experienced fewer pulmonary exacerbations and lower CRP levels than those with PA. In adult CF patients, SA infections alone, in the absence of PA, are a marker of milder disease.

"	"Induction of mucus hypersecretion in the airway epithelium by Th2 cytokines is associated with the expression of TMEM16A, a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel. We asked whether exposure of airway epithelial cells to bacterial components, a condition that mimics the highly infected environment occurring in cystic fibrosis (CF), also results in a similar response. In cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, treatment with pyocyanin or with a P. aeruginosa culture supernatant caused a significant increase in TMEM16A function. The Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion, triggered by stimulation with UTP, was particularly enhanced by pyocyanin in cells from CF patients. Increased expression of TMEM16A protein and of MUC5AC mucin by bacterial components was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in CF and non-CF cells. We also investigated TMEM16A expression in human bronchi by immunocytochemistry. We found increased TMEM16A staining in the airways of CF patients. The strongest signal was observed in CF submucosal glands. Our results suggest that TMEM16A expression/function is upregulated in CF lung disease, possibly as a response towards the presence of bacteria in the airways.

26633362	"RpoN Regulates Virulence Factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via Modulating the PqsR Quorum Sensing Regulator
"	"The alternative sigma factor RpoN regulates many cell functions, such as motility, quorum sensing, and virulence in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). P. aeruginosa often evolves rpoN-negative variants during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patients. It is unclear how RpoN interacts with other regulatory mechanisms to control virulence of P. aeruginosa. In this study, we show that RpoN modulates the function of PqsR, a quorum sensing receptor regulating production of virulence factors including the phenazine pyocyanin. The ∆rpoN mutant is able to synthesize 4-quinolone signal molecule HHQ but unable to activate PqsR and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (pqs) quorum sensing. The ∆rpoN mutant produces minimal level of pyocyanin and is unable to produce the anti-staphylococcal agents. Providing pqsR in trans in the ∆rpoN mutant restores its pqs quorum sensing and virulence factor production to the wild-type level. Our study provides evidence that RpoN has a regulatory effect on P. aeruginosa virulence through modulating the function of the PqsR quorum sensing regulator.

26715741	"Trace incorporation of heavy water reveals slow and heterogeneous pathogen growth rates in cystic fibrosis sputum
"	"Effective treatment for chronic infections is undermined by a significant gap in understanding of the physiological state of pathogens at the site of infection. Chronic pulmonary infections are responsible for the morbidity and mortality of millions of immunocompromised individuals worldwide, yet drugs that are successful in laboratory culture are far less effective against pathogen populations persisting in vivo. Laboratory models, upon which preclinical development of new drugs is based, can only replicate host conditions when we understand the metabolic state of the pathogens and the degree of heterogeneity within the population. In this study, we measured the anabolic activity of the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus directly in the sputum of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), by combining the high sensitivity of isotope ratio mass spectrometry with a heavy water labeling approach to capture the full range of in situ growth rates. Our results reveal S. aureus generation times with a median of 2.1 d, with extensive growth rate heterogeneity at the single-cell level. These growth rates are far below the detection limit of previous estimates of CF pathogen growth rates, and the rates are slowest in acutely sick patients undergoing pulmonary exacerbations; nevertheless, they are accessible to experimental replication within laboratory models. Treatment regimens that include specific antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin) further appear to correlate with slow growth of S. aureus on average, but follow-up longitudinal studies must be performed to determine whether this effect holds for individual patients.

We examined the association between bacterial colonization in the sputum (MRSA with or without pseudomonas (PA)) and computed tomography (CT) scores in CF patients. MRSA patients were divided according to PA status based on at least three consecutive sputum cultures; controls were patients without MRSA (with or without PA), matched for gender and age at CT. Clinical data and CT scores were compared between groups. Of 33 patients with MRSA, 14 had no PA (MRSA + PA-) and 19 had also PA (MRSA + PA+). MRSA + PA- and MRSA + PA+ patients had CT scores similar to their controls PA+ (38.25 ± 20.18 vs. 32.22 ± 18.74, P = .4, and 41.88 ± 18.18 vs. 45.33 ± 11.5, P = .4, respectively). Although MRSA + PA- had worse CT scores than their matched PA- controls, their mean FEV1 values were similar. Colonization with MRSA in CF is associated with structural CT changes at least similar to those in PA. A cause and effect relationship cannot be established. The current findings call for a larger study assessing longitudinally the impact of MRSA acquisition and eradication protocols.

"	"Chronic pulmonary colonization with bacterial pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We observed that β1-integrins accumulate on the luminal membrane of upper-airway epithelial cells from mice and humans with CF. β1-integrin accumulation is due to increased ceramide and the formation of ceramide platforms that trap β1-integrins on the luminal pole of bronchial epithelial cells. β1-integrins downregulate acid ceramidase expression, resulting in further accumulation of ceramide and consequent reduction of surface sphingosine, a lipid that kills bacteria. Interrupting this vicious cycle by triggering surface β1-integrin internalization via anti-β1-integrin antibodies or the RGD peptide ligand-or by genetic or pharmacological correction of ceramide levels-normalizes β1-integrin distribution and sphingosine levels in CF epithelial cells and prevents P. aeruginosa infection in CF mice. These findings suggest a therapeutic avenue to ameliorate CF-associated bacterial infections.

"	"Lung transplantation has revolutionized the treatment of end-stage pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis. However, infection of the transplanted lungs can lead to serious complications, including graft failure and death. Although many of these patients have concurrent sinusitis, it is unclear whether bacteria from the sinuses can infect the allograft. This is a single-institution retrospective study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis from 2005 to 2015 at Duke University Hospital. Pre- and posttransplant nasal and pulmonary cultures obtained via nasal endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), respectively, were analyzed. A total of 141 patients underwent 144 lung transplants. Sinus cultures were available for 76 patients (12 pretransplant, 42 posttransplant, 22 both pre- and posttransplant). Pretransplant BAL cultures were available for 139 patients, and posttransplant BAL cultures were available for all patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were the most common organisms cultured. There was a significant correlation between pretransplant sinus and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA (p = 0.003), MRSA (p = 0.013), and Burkholderia cepacia (p = 0.001). There was a high correlation between pretransplant sinus cultures and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA, MRSA, and Burkholderia sp. This suggests that the paranasal sinuses may act as a reservoir for allograft colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of sinusitis affects allograft colonization and transplant outcomes.

"	"Ivacaftor is generally safe and effective in patients aged 2 years and older who have cystic fibrosis and specific CFTR mutations. We assessed its use in children aged 12 to <24 months. The ARRIVAL study is a phase 3, single-arm, two-part, multicentre study. Eligible children were aged 12 to <24 months at enrolment and had a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele and could participate in one or both parts of the study. Children received 50 mg (bodyweight 7 to <14 kg) or 75 mg (bodyweight ≥14 to <25 kg) ivacaftor orally every 12 h. In study part A, children received ivacaftor for 3 days plus one morning. In study part B, children received 24 weeks of treatment. Children were enrolled into part A at seven sites in Australia (one site), the UK (one), and the USA (five) and into part B at 13 sites in Australia (two sites), Canada (one), the UK (three), and the USA (seven). Primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (parts A and B) in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part B were pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration. We also explored changes in growth parameters and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02725567. Children aged 12 to <24 months were enrolled between Aug 25, 2016, and Nov 1, 2017. Seven children were enrolled in part A, of whom five received 50 mg and two received 75 mg ivacaftor. All completed treatment. Of 19 children enrolled in part B, including one from part A, all received 50 mg ivacaftor and 18 completed treatment (one withdrew because of difficulty with blood draws). All children received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Pharmacokinetics indicated exposure was similar to that in children aged 2 to <6 years and adults. No children discontinued because of adverse events or safety findings. In part A, three (43%) of seven children had treatment-emergent adverse events, all of which were mild and deemed not to be or unlikely to be related to ivacaftor. By 24 weeks in part B, treatment-emergent adverse events had been reported in 18 (95%) of 19 children, of which most were mild or moderate and the most frequent was cough (14 [74%] children). Two children in part B had four serious adverse events: one had constipation (possibly related to ivacaftor), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and eczema herpeticum, and one had persistent cough, all needing hospital admission. In five (28%) of 18 children aspartate or alanine aminotransferase concentrations rose to more than three times the upper limit of normal (to more than eight times in two children with concurrent infections). At week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was -73·5 (SD 17·5) mmol/L. Growth parameters for age were normal at baseline and at week 24. At week 24, concentrations of faecal elastase-1 had increased and concentrations of immunoreactive trypsinogen had decreased from baseline. Mean serum lipase and amylase were raised at baseline and rapidly decreased after treatment was started. Ivacaftor was generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 12 to <24 months for up to 24 weeks and was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in sweat chloride concentrations. Improvements in biomarkers of pancreatic function suggest that ivacaftor preserves exocrine pancreatic function if started early. The study is continuing in infants younger than 12 months.

"	"Background Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common comorbidity reported in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). There is a dearth of data on glucose intolerance or CFRD in children with CF from developing countries. So, we planned to study the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) in children with CF and its relation with the duration and severity of CF. Methods We performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on children (2-18 years old) having CF for at least 6 months. Two-hour plasma glucose levels on OGTT were correlated with various disease-related factors. Results Out of the 25 children enrolled, there were 18 boys and seven girls. The mean age and duration of CF were 7.9±4.3 and 3.16±2.5 years, respectively. AGT was observed in 16 (64%) children with CF including three (12%) children with CFRD. Children with a duration of CF of 3 years had significantly higher prevalence (81.8%) of AGT when compared with duration ≤3 years (p-value<0.05). Twelve out of 17 (70.6%) children were colonized with Pseudomonas and 12 out of 15 (80%) children >6 years of age had AGT. There was a positive correlation of 2-h glucose value on OGTT with duration of CF and number of hospitalizations with acute pulmonary exacerbations. Conclusions The majority of children having CF for >3 years and/or age >6 years developed AGT. In our clinical setting, an annual screening with OGTT to detect AGT may be required at an early age and duration of CF.

However, confirmatory testing of presumptive screen-positive cases is required using high efficiency separations for improved specificity in order to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for certain classes of IEMs. Here, we describe recent advances using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for reliable second-tier screening or confirmatory testing based on targeted analysis of amino acids, acylcarnitines, nucleosides, and other classes of polar metabolites associated with IEMs. Additionally, nontargeted metabolite profiling enables the identification of unknown biomarkers of clinical significance for other genetic diseases that are currently screened by bioassays and/or mutation panels, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Noteworthy, CE-MS allows for resolution of isobaric/isomeric interferences without complicated sample handling that is ideal when analyzing volume-restricted biospecimens from neonates/infants, including dried blood spots and sweat specimens. New developments to improve concentration sensitivity, as well as enhance sample throughput and quality control for unambiguous confirmatory testing of IEMs will also be discussed when using multiplexed separations based on multisegment injection-CE-MS.

To compare the utility of lung T1-mapping MRI with ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI in children with cystic fibrosis in detecting early stage lung disease and monitoring pulmonary exacerbations. We performed a prospective study in 16 children between September 2017 and January 2018. In Phase 1, we compared five CF patients with normal spirometry (mean 11.2 years) to five age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. In Phase 2, we longitudinally evaluated six CF patients (median 11 years) in acute pulmonary exacerbation. All children had non-contrast lung T1-mapping and UTE MRI and spirometry testing. We compared the mean normalized T1 value and percentage lung volume without T1 value in CF patients and healthy subjects in Phase 1 and during treatment in Phase 2. We also performed cystic fibrosis MRI scoring. We evaluated differences in continuous variables using standard statistical tests. In Phase 1, mean normalized T1 values of the lung were significantly lower in CF patients in comparison to healthy controls (P=0.02) except in the right lower lobe (P=0.29). The percentage lung volume without T1 value was also significantly higher in CF patients (P=0.006). UTE MRI showed no significant differences between CF patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.11). In Phase 2, excluding one outlier case who developed systemic disease in the course of treatment, the whole-lung T1 value increased (P=0.001) and perfusion scoring improved (P=0.02) following therapy. We observed no other significant changes in the MRI scoring. Lung T1-mapping MRI can detect early regional pulmonary CF disease in children and might be helpful in the assessment of acute pulmonary exacerbations.

The majority of these patients (58.7%, n = 111) had a duration of symptoms between 5-10 years. The etiology of bronchiectasis was identified in 92.9% of cases. Post-infectious bronchiectasis was the most common cause (67.8%, n = 133), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (9.2%, n = 18), and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (7.1%, n = 14). Among the post infectious causes, a history of TB was present in 85% (n = 114/133) of patients. Obstructive impairment was the most common spirometric pattern, observed in 68.9% (n = 135) of patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated organism (36.2%, n = 71). Hemoptysis was the most frequent complication found in 20.9% of patients (n = 41). Out of these 196 patients, 94.4% (n = 185) received medical management and were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory failure was significantly associated with the Pseudomonas group as compared to non-pseudomonas group [(n = 21 (29%) vs n = 18 (14.4%) p = 0.01]. During hospitalization seven patients (3.6%) were died because of respiratory failure. Conclusions Post TB bronchiectasis was the leading cause of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis in this cohort, with Pseudomonas was the commonest pathogen isolated from the respiratory specimen, which was significantly associated with respiratory failure. On spirometry, obstructive impairment was found in the majority of patients and hemoptysis was the most frequent complication.

33010097	"Impulse oscillometry and spirometry measurements relative to personal best values at the time of acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis in adults
"	"Diagnosis of acute exacerbation (AE) of cystic fibrosis (CF) must be precise because both under- and over-prescription of antibiotics may be detrimental. How lung function tests contribute to diagnose AE is unclear. We aimed to describe variation of spirometry and oscillometry measurements, at Stable state and at AE in adults with CF. Patients were included in a retrospective single-centre study when both spirometry (FEV1, FVC) and oscillometry (X5, R5, R5-R20 and AX) data were available for at least one Stable and one AE visit between December 2016 and July 2019. For each visit, we calculated variation (Δ) in spirometry and oscillometry indices in comparison with personal best values. Measurements were expressed as % of predicted values and Z-scores when applicable. Areas under ROC curves (AUC) were computed. Forty-two patients (28 ± 9 years, FEV1 64 ± 21%) were included; 80 AE and 104 Stable visits were analysed. FEV1 (L, %pred and Z-score) and FVC (%pred and Z-score) varied significantly between AE and Stable visits (p < .05), although differences were small (80 ml/2.7%pred for FEV1). Among oscillometry indices, X5 (kPa.s.L-1 ), R5-R20 (kPa.s.L-1 ) and AX (kPa/L) varied significantly. The AUCs for the variation in spirometry indices ranged from 0.601 (ΔFVC L) to 0.635 (ΔFEV1%pred). They were not significantly different from the AUCs for ΔX5 (0.589), ΔR5-R20 (0.649) and ΔAX (0.598). Performance of both spirometry and oscillometry to discriminate AE from Stable state was poor. Variation of oscillometry indices (X5, R5-R20, AX) may be helpful when spirometry is unreliable or uncomfortable.

33257262	"Updated guidance on the management of children with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-related metabolic syndrome/cystic fibrosis screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CRMS/CFSPID)
"	"Over the past two decades there has been considerable progress with the evaluation and management of infants with an inconclusive diagnosis following Newborn Screening (NBS) for cystic Fibrosis (CF). In addition, we have an increasing amount of evidence on which to base guidance on the management of these infants and, importantly, we have a consistent designation being used across the globe of CRMS/CFSPID. There is still work to be undertaken and research questions to answer, but these infants now receive more consistent and appropriate care pathways than previously. It is clear that the majority of these infants remain healthy, do not convert to a diagnosis of CF in childhood, and advice on management should reflect this. However, it is also clear that some will convert to a CF diagnosis and monitoring of these infants should facilitate their early recognition. Those infants that do not convert to a CF diagnosis have some potential of developing a CFTR-RD later in life. At present, it is not possible to quantify this risk, but families need to be provided with clear information of what to look out for. This paper contains a number of changes from previous guidance in light of developing evidence, but the major change is the recommendation of a detailed assessment of the child with CRMS/CFSPID in the sixth year of age, including respiratory function assessment and imaging. With these data, the CF team can discuss future care arrangements with the family and come to a shared decision on the best way forward, which may include discharge to primary care with appropriate information. Information is key for these families, and we recommend consideration of a further appointment when the individual is a young adult to directly communicate the implications of the CRMS/CFSPID designation.

33544657	"A Prospective Study of the Effects of Sex Hormones on Lung Function and Inflammation in Women with Cystic Fibrosis.
"	"Epidemiologic studies demonstrate worse outcomes in women with cystic fibrosis (CF) than men. Women are colonized earlier with respiratory pathogens and have increased rates of pulmonary exacerbations post-puberty and near ovulation. The etiology of this disparity is unclear, but sex hormones may contribute to these differences. We sought to explore if natural hormonal fluctuations and hormonal contraception associate with changes in lung function, respiratory symptoms, or inflammatory markers. We prospectively followed women with CF who were not on hormonal contraceptives and reported regular menstrual cycles. We captured study visits at points that corresponded to menses, ovulation, and the luteal phase. A subset of subjects were subsequently placed on a standard oral estrogen/progesterone combination contraceptive pill, ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (Loestrin), and re-evaluated. Measurements included lung function, symptom questionnaires, sweat tests, blood for hormone levels, and sputum for inflammatory markers, bacterial density, and cytology. Twenty-three women participated in this study. Hormone levels were as expected on and off hormonal contraception. At times of peak estrogen (ovulation), there was a significant increase in sputum pro-inflammatory cytokines (neutrophil free elastase) and a corresponding pattern of decrease in lung function. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, neutrophil free elastase) improved when placed on hormone contraception. Our results show that there are potentially important fluctuations in inflammatory biomarkers in the lungs that correlate with changes in lung function in women with CF. Larger studies evaluating the impact of sex hormones on airway inflammation and immune response are necessary to better understand the clinical impact of these responses. Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02036879).

"	"Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for Phe508del with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % pred >40%. We assessed the clinical utility of LUM/IVA in all eligible adult CF patients with FEV1 % pred <40% treated for at least 1 year under a single-centre managed access programme. Following clinical optimisation, eligible patients (n=40) with FEV1 % pred <40% were commenced on LUM/IVA and monitored for tolerance and clinical outcomes, including health service utilisation, pulmonary function, weight and body composition. 24 patients reached 1 year of treatment by the time of evaluation. Six patients discontinued due to adverse events (five for increased airways reactivity) and three underwent lung transplantation. In comparison with the year prior to LUM/IVA commencement, significant reductions (median per year) were observed in the treatment year in the number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (from 3 to 1.5; p=0.0002), hospitalisation days (from 27 to 17; p=0.0002) and intravenous antibiotic (IVAB) usage days (from 45 to 27; p=0.0007). Mean±sd change in FEV1 % pred was -2.10±1.18% per year in the year prior, with the decline reversed in the year following (+1.45±1.13% per year; p=0.035), although there was significant heterogeneity in individual responses. Mean±sd weight gain at 1 year was 2.5±4.1 kg (p=0.0007), comprising mainly fat mass (mean 2.2 kg). The proportion of patients severely underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg·m-2) decreased from 33% at baseline to 13% at 1 year (p=0.003). This real-world evaluation study demonstrated benefits over several clinical domains (infective exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, IVABs, pulmonary function decline and nutritional parameters) in CF patients with severe lung disease.

21259449	"Screening for symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis
"	"Although studies have assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), few have been conducted since the advent of new medical treatments (e.g., nebulized antibiotics, ThAIRpy Vest). Study objectives were to: (1) document symptoms of depression and anxiety for adolescents and young adults with CF and compare with normative values, (2) examine the associations among depressive/anxiety symptoms and gender, age, lung function, and body mass index, and (3) determine the relations between adolescent and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patients and caregivers completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anytime (e.g., beginning or end) during routine CF clinic appointments. Participants included 59 adolescents/young adults with CF (M(age)  = 15.8 years, 54% female, 98% Caucasian, M(FEV1% predicted)  = 84.6) and caregivers of 40 adolescents. Although symptom scores were in the normative range for patients with CF (M(Depression)  = 2.27 and M(Anxiety)  = 5.59), 3% and 32% exhibited clinically elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with age (r = 0.28, 0.36). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were also positively correlated (r = 0.48). Females endorsed higher anxiety symptoms than males. While adolescent and caregiver anxiety scores were not related, higher caregiver depressive symptoms were associated with older patient age and worse lung function. Data from the current study suggest low levels of depressive symptoms and substantial levels of anxiety symptoms in adolescents and young adults with CF. Consistent with prior literature, depressive symptoms appear higher in older patients and are significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Caregiver symptomology appears to be more affected by an adolescent's health status, suggesting a need to screen caregivers when health begins to decline.

26846474	"On the mechanism of gating defects caused by the R117H mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
"	"Two functional abnormalities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a 25% reduction of the single-channel conductance (g) and a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po ), were found with the R117H mutation that is associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis. Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25% decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po ). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged 'burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by ∼10-fold. Moreover, our data demonstrate that a synergistic improvement of R117H-CFTR function can be accomplished with a combined regiment of VX-770 (Ivacaftor), nitrate ion (NO3 (-) ) and N(6) -(2-phenylethyl)-2'-deoxy-ATP (d-PATP), which almost completely rectifies the gating defect of R117H-CFTR. Clinical implications of our results are discussed.

27084387	"Evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis
"	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multisystemic disorder with broad clinical manifestations apart from the well-characterized pulmonary dysfunction. Recent findings have described impairment in conduit vessel function in patients with CF; however, whether microvascular function is affected in this population has yet to be elucidated. Using laser-Doppler imaging, we evaluated microvascular function through postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), local thermal hyperemia (LTH), and iontophoresis with acetylcholine (ACh). PORH [518 ± 174% (CF) and 801 ± 125% (control), P = 0.039], LTH [1,338 ± 436% (CF) and 1,574 ± 620% (control), P = 0.045], and iontophoresis with ACh [416 ± 140% (CF) and 617 ± 143% (control), P = 0.032] were significantly lower in patients with CF than control subjects. In addition, the ratio of PORH to LTH was significantly (P = 0.043) lower in patients with CF (55.3 ± 5.1%) than control subjects (68.8 ± 3.1%). Significant positive correlations between LTH and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%predicted) (r = 0.441, P = 0.013) and between the PORH-to-LTH ratio and exercise capacity (r = 0.350, P = 0.049) were observed. These data provide evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with CF compared with control subjects. In addition, our data demonstrate a complex relationship between microvascular function and classical markers of disease severity (i.e., pulmonary function and exercise capacity) in CF.

"	"Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) can develop silently in early life and approximately 10% of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) become cirrhotic before adulthood. Clinical, biological, and ultrasound criteria used to define CFLD often reveal liver involvement at an advanced stage. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the progression of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in pediatric patients with CF. The change of LSM, expressed as kPa/year and %/year, was measured using transient elastography (Fibroscan) in 82 children with CF (median age: 6.8 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 5.8). Mean time interval between the 2 LSM was 3.5 years. Median initial liver stiffness was 3.7 kPa (IQR: 1.3), and then progressed by 0.23 kPa/year, that is, 6%/year. The 7 patients who developed CFLD had a higher initial level of alanine aminotransferase (50 [IQR: 15] vs 30 [IQR: 18], P = 0.0001) and presented a more rapid progression of LSM (0.94 vs 0.23 kPa/year, P = 0.02). The present study shows that the slope of worsening of liver stiffness is greater in patients who will develop CFLD, suggesting that annual transient elastography may be useful to detect risk of severe liver disease at an earlier stage.

"	"In cystic fibrosis, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel causes misfolding and premature degradation. One possible approach to reducing the detrimental health effects of cystic fibrosis could be the identification of proteins whose suppression rescues F508del-CFTR function in bronchial epithelial cells. However, searches for these potential targets have not yet been conducted, particularly in a relevant airway background using a functional readout. To identify proteins associated with F508del-CFTR processing, we used a high-throughput functional assay to screen an siRNA library targeting 6,650 different cellular proteins. We identified 37 proteins whose silencing significantly rescued F508del-CFTR activity, as indicated by enhanced anion transport through the plasma membrane. These proteins included FAU, UBE2I, UBA52, MLLT6, UBA2, CHD4, PLXNA1, and TRIM24, among others. We focused our attention on FAU, a poorly characterized protein with unknown function. FAU knockdown increased the plasma membrane targeting and function of F508del-CFTR, but not of wild-type CFTR. Investigation into the mechanism of action revealed a preferential physical interaction of FAU with mutant CFTR, leading to its degradation. FAU and other proteins identified in our screening may offer a therapeutically relevant panel of drug targets to correct basic defects in F508del-CFTR processing.

Surprisingly, resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones of mexZ mutants was far below the breakpoint of clinical resistance. However, the fitness increase of the mutant bacteria in presence of the relevant antibiotics, as demonstrated in competition experiments between mutant and ancestor bacteria, showed that 1) very small phenotypic changes cause significant fitness increase with severe adaptive consequences, and 2) standardized phenotypic tests fail to detect such low-level variations. The frequent appearance of P. aeruginosa mexZ mutants in CF patients is directly connected to the intense use of the target antibiotics, and low-level antibiotic resistance, if left unnoticed, can result in accumulation of additional genetic changes leading to high-level resistance.

"	"Although K+ channels are important in mediating the driving force for colonic ion transport, their role in small intestinal transport is poorly understood. To investigate this, small intestinal short circuit currents (Isc ) and HCO3- secretion were measured in mice, and intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in small intestinal epithelial SCBN cells. The expression and location of Kv subtypes were verified by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Diabetic mice were also used to investigate the role of Kv subtypes in regulating intestinal glucose absorption. We found that KV7.1 is not involved in duodenal ion transport, while KCa3.1 selectively regulates duodenal Isc and HCO3- secretion in a Ca2+-mediated but not cAMP-mediated manner. Blockade of KCa3.1 increased the rate of HCO3- fluxes via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels in SCBN cells. Jejunal Isc was significantly stimulated by glucose, but markedly inhibited by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA). Moreover, both Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 were expressed in jejunal mucosae. Finally, 4-AP significantly attenuated weight gain of normal and diabetic mice, and both 4-AP and TEA significantly lowered blood glucose of diabetic mice. This study not only examines the contribution of various K+ channel subtypes to small intestinal epithelial ion transport and glucose absorption, but also proposes a novel concept for developing specific K+ channel blockers to reduce weight gain and lower blood glucose in diabetes mellitus.

32811866	"ENaC regulation by phospholipids and DGK explained through mathematical modeling
"	"Cystic fibrosis is a condition caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It is also thought to increase the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The altered function of these ion channels is one of the causes of the thick dehydrated mucus that characterizes the disease and is partially responsible for recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation events that ultimately destroy the lungs of affected subjects. Phosphoinositides are signaling lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes and membrane proteins, including ENaC. Inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an enzyme of the phosphoinositide pathway, reduces ENaC function. We propose a computational analysis that is based on the combination of two existing mathematical models: one representing the dynamics of phosphoinositides and the other explaining how phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) influences ENaC activity and, consequently, airway surface liquid. This integrated model permits, for the first time, a detailed assessment of the intricate interactions between DGK and ENaC and is consistent with available literature data. In particular, the computational approach allows comparisons of two competing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ENaC. The results strongly suggest that the regulation of ENaC is primarily exerted through the control of PI(4,5)P2 production by type-I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KI), which in turn is controlled by phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of the DGK reaction.

The main aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with genetically diagnosed PCD and to investigate the correlation between clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings and genetic analyses of these patients. This is a cohort study in which we analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and genetic results of 46 patients with genetically diagnosed PCD through whole-exome sequencing at our single center from a total of 265 patients with PCD within a 5-year period. Genetic analysis revealed pathogenic variants in DNAH5 (n = 12 individuals, 12 families), CCDC40 (n = 9 individuals, six families), RSPH4A (n = 5 individuals, three families), DNAH11 (n = 4 individuals, four families), HYDIN (n = 5 individuals, five families), CCNO (n = 4 individuals, four families), DNAI1 (n = 2 individuals, one family), ARMC4 (n = 2 individuals, two families), TTC25 (n = 1), DNAH1 (n = 1), and CCDC39 (n = 1) genes. Although not statistically significant, the age at diagnosis was lower (median: 3 years; range, 6 months-4 years) in patients with CCNO pathogenic variants due to the early reporting of symptoms, and the median body mass index (BMI) and BMI z scores were lower in patients at 18.7 and 16 kg/m2 , and -0.78 and -1.2 with CCDC40 and CCNO pathogenic variants, respectively. The median forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75% were 53%, 64%, and 28%, respectively; these parameters were also lower in the CCDC40 group than in the other groups. There was no significant correlation between the genetic results and symptoms, radiologic findings, and microbiologic data of patients with PCD. In PCD, there was significant heterogeneity of lung disease, patients who had pathogenic variants in CCNO presented earlier, and those with CCDC40 and CCNO had worse lung disease, and poorer nutritional status compared with the other subgroups. We hope that whole genotype-phenotype and clinical relationships will be identified in PCD.

"	"Studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model because disruption of essential ciliary genes in mice results in a high incidence of lethal hydrocephalus. To develop a viable mouse model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1, are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA, and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6 months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD.

We report our extensive experience of TEM analysis in a large series of patients in order to evaluate its feasibility and results. TEM analysis performed in 1,149 patients with suspected PCD was retrospectively reviewed. Biopsies (1,450) were obtained from nasal (44%) or bronchial (56%) mucosa in children (66.5%) and adults (33.5%). TEM analysis was feasible in 71.4% of patients and showed a main defect suggestive of PCD in 29.9%. TEM was more feasible in adults than in children, regardless of the biopsy site. Main defects suggestive of PCD were found in 76.9% of patients with sinopulmonary symptoms and in only 0.4% of patients with isolated upper and 0.4% with isolated lower respiratory tract infections. The defect pattern was similar in children and adults, involving dynein arms (81.2%) or central complex (CC) (18.8%). Situs inversus was never observed in PCD patients with CC defect. Kartagener syndrome with normal ciliary ultrastructure was not an exceptional condition (10.2% of PCD). In conclusion, TEM analysis is feasible in most patients and is particularly useful for PCD diagnosis in cases of sinopulmonary syndrome of unknown origin.

"	"Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have structural and/or functional alterations of cilia that imply deficits in mucociliary clearance and different respiratory pathologies. A useful indicator for the difficult diagnosis is the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) that is significantly lower in pathological cases than in physiological ones. The CBF computation is not rapid, therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an automated method to evaluate it directly from videos of ciliated cells. The cells are taken from inferior nasal turbinates and videos of ciliary movements are registered and eventually processed by the developed software. The software consists in the extraction of features from videos (written with C++ language) and the computation of the frequency (written with Matlab language). This system was tested both on the samples of nasal cavity and software models, and the results were really promising because in a few seconds, it can compute a reliable frequency if compared with that measured with visual methods. It is to be noticed that the reliability of the computation increases with the quality of acquisition system and especially with the sampling frequency. It is concluded that the developed software could be a useful mean for PCD diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital autosomal recessive disease that produces impairment of mucosal ciliary movement. Children with this disorder usually manifest recurrent and chronic infections of the upper and lower airways. We describe the history of a 12-month-old boy in whom the correct diagnosis of PCD was achieved after the occurrence of ethmoid mucocele associated with omolateral proptosis. A careful description of this new feature of PCD and its dangerous complications are also presented.

20097527	"Ventricular rotation is independent of cardiac looping: a study in mice with situs inversus totalis using speckle-tracking echocardiography
"	"The authors conducted an ultrasound interrogation of a mutant mouse model with a Dnah5 mutation to determine whether cardiac mechanics may be affected by reversal of cardiac situs. This mutant is a bona fide model of primary ciliary dyskinesia, with surviving homozygous mice showing either situs solitus (SS) or situs inversus totalis (SI). High-frequency ultrasound interrogations of 27 neonatal and infant Dnah5 mutant mice, 16 with SS and 11 with SI, were conducted using an ultra-high-frequency biomicroscope. Electrocardiographic and respiratory gating were used to reconstruct high-resolution two-dimensional cines at 1,000 Hz, with speckle-tracking echocardiography used to further analyze midchamber and apical rotation. All SS mice exhibited the expected counterclockwise apical rotation as viewed caudocranially, and surprisingly, the same counterclockwise motion was also observed in SI mice. Speckle-tracking analysis confirmed counterclockwise systolic rotation in both SS and SI mice, and this increased in magnitude from the subepicardium to the endocardium and from the papillary muscles to the apex. The magnitude of apical endocardial rotation was not different for SS and SI mice (5.64+/-0.75 degrees and 5.76+/-1.90 degrees, respectively, P=.93). The anatomic segments responsible for the largest components of apical endocardial systolic rotation differed between the SS and SI hearts (P=.004). In both, the two largest contributors to rotation were offset 180 degrees from each other, but the anatomic regions differed between them. In SS hearts, maximal regional rotation occurred at the anterior mid-septum and posterolateral free wall, while in SI hearts, it was derived from the posterior septum and the anterolateral free wall. Analysis by episcopic fluorescence image capture histology of representative SI and SS mice showed normal intracardiac and segmental anatomy ({S,D,S} or {I,L,I}) without intracardiac defects. These results show that mirror-image cardiac looping did not result in mirror-image rotation of the morphologic left ventricle. These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether fiber orientation and cardiac mechanics may be abnormal in individuals with reversal of cardiac situs. The results of this study indicate that cardiac looping and myofiber orientation may be independently regulated.

"	"The quakingviable mouse (qkv) is a spontaneous recessive mouse mutant with a deletion of approximately 1.1 Mb in the proximal region of chromosome 17. The deletion affects the expression of three genes; quaking (Qk), Parkin-coregulated gene (Pacrg) and parkin (Park2). The resulting phenotype, which includes dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression, respectively. Pacrg is required for correct development of the spermatozoan flagella, a specialized type of motile cilia. In vertebrates, motile cilia are required for multiple functions related to cellular movement or movement of media over a stationary cell surface. To investigate the potential role of PACRG in motile cilia we analysed qkv mutant mice for evidence of cilial dysfunction. Histological and magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated that qkv mutant mice were affected by acquired, communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structural analysis of ependymal cilia demonstrated that the 9 + 2 arrangement of axonemal microtubules was intact and that both the density of ciliated cells and cilia length was similar to wild-type littermates. Cilia function studies showed a reduction in ependymal cilial beat frequency and cilial mediated flow in qkv mutant mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Moreover, transgenic expression of Pacrg was necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC phenotype in the qkv mutant. This study provides novel in vivo evidence that Pacrg is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia and primary ciliary dyskinesia.

20167855	"Lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a cross-sectional and 3-decade longitudinal study
"	"Early diagnosis and treatment is considered important to prevent lung damage in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Few studies have addressed long-term evolution of lung function after PCD diagnosis. We investigated whether long-term lung function was dependent on age or level of lung function at PCD diagnosis. An observational, single-center, cross-sectional, and three-decade longitudinal study of FEV(1) and FVC related to age at diagnosis until current age was performed. Linear regression was used to describe the relation between first measured lung function values and age at diagnosis across the cohort. Courses of lung function after diagnosis and the according slopes were used to group patients into increasing, stable, or decreasing courses. Additionally, slopes from courses of 10 years of follow-up were related to age at diagnosis and initial level of lung function, respectively, using linear regression. Seventy-four children and adults with PCD were observed for median 9.5 (range, 1.5-30.2) years during which 2,937 lung function measurements were performed. First measured FEV(1) was less than 80% of predicted in one-third of preschool-diagnosed children. During observation, 34% of patients lost more than 10 percentage points, 57% were stable, and 10% improved more than 10 percentage points in FEV(1). Courses of lung function after diagnosis were related to neither age at diagnosis nor initial level. Our study strongly suggests that PCD is a disease of serious threat to lung function already at preschool age, and with a high degree of variation in courses of lung function after diagnosis that was not linked to either age or level of lung function at diagnosis. Early diagnosis did not protect against decline in lung function.

Family-based sequencing allowed us to delineate recombination sites precisely, identify 70% of the sequencing errors (resulting in > 99.999% accuracy), and identify very rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We also directly estimated a human intergeneration mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome, for which the gene was concurrently identified, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes have been previously identified. Family-based genome analysis enabled us to narrow the candidate genes for both of these Mendelian disorders to only four. Our results demonstrate the value of complete genome sequencing in families.

20335083	"Value of nasal nitric oxide in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"The aim of this study is to report nasal nitric oxide (nNO) values in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and to compare them with nNO values in healthy children, asthmatic children, children with cystic fibrosis and children with post infectious bronchiectasis. We determined nNO values in 9 children with PCD, 36 asthmatic children, 31 children with cystic fibrosis, 8 children with post infectious bronchiectasis and 37 healthy children. We compared nNO values between these different conditions and calculated sensitivity and specificity of nNO to diagnose PCD. All children with PCD - except one (nNO 348 ppb) - had nNO values below 112 ppb, mean 88 ppb (95%CI 9.6-166). The nNO mean was 898 ppb (95%CI 801-995) in healthy children, 1023 ppb (95%CI 911-1137) in asthmatic children, 438 ppb (95%CI 367-508) in cystic fibrosis children and 361 ppb (95%CI 252-470) in children with post infectious bronchiectasis. The mean concentration of nNO was lower (P<0.05) in PCD patients, compared to the other groups. The measurement of nasal NO in our study population showed, at a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb, a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 99.1% in the diagnosis of PCD [ROC 0.98 (95%CI 0.94-0.99); P<0.0001; probability ratio 95.1]. The measurement of nasal NO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD, in which a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb suggests the disease, although nNO above 112 ppb does not exclude PCD.

"	"For all motile eukaryotic cilia and flagella, beating is regulated by changes in intraciliary calcium concentration. Although the mechanism for calcium regulation is not understood, numerous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is a key axonemal calcium sensor. Using anti-CaM antibodies and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii axonemal extracts, we precipitated a complex that includes four polypeptides and that specifically interacts with CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. One of the complex members, FAP221, is an orthologue of mammalian Pcdp1 (primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1). Both FAP221 and mammalian Pcdp1 specifically bind CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. Reduced expression of Pcdp1 complex members in C. reinhardtii results in failure of the C1d central pair projection to assemble and significant impairment of motility including uncoordinated bends, severely reduced beat frequency, and altered waveforms. These combined results reveal that the central pair Pcdp1 (FAP221) complex is essential for control of ciliary motility.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary disorder of mucociliary clearance causing chronic upper and lower airways disease. We determined the number of patients with diagnosed PCD across Europe, described age at diagnosis and determined risk factors for late diagnosis. Centres treating children with PCD in Europe answered questionnaires and provided anonymous patient lists. In total, 223 centres from 26 countries reported 1,009 patients aged < 20 yrs. Reported cases per million children (for 5-14 yr olds) were highest in Cyprus (111), Switzerland (47) and Denmark (46). Overall, 57% were males and 48% had situs inversus. Median age at diagnosis was 5.3 yrs, lower in children with situs inversus (3.5 versus 5.8 yrs; p < 0.001) and in children treated in large centres (4.1 versus 4.8 yrs; p = 0.002). Adjusted age at diagnosis was 5.0 yrs in Western Europe, 4.8 yrs in the British Isles, 5.5 yrs in Northern Europe, 6.8 yrs in Eastern Europe and 6.5 yrs in Southern Europe (p < 0.001). This strongly correlated with general government expenditures on health (p < 0.001). This European survey suggests that PCD in children is under-diagnosed and diagnosed late, particularly in countries with low health expenditures. Prospective studies should assess the impact this delay might have on patient prognosis and on health economic costs across Europe.

"	"Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) mediates the reaction 2ADP <--> ATP + AMP, providing energy for the beating of cilia. A study recently showed that AK7 expression may be correlated with the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) phenotype in mice. In this study, we characterized AK7 expression in vitro in an air-liquid interface (ALI) model and in middle nasal turbinate biopsy specimens from a cohort of patients with PCD to elucidate whether AK7 expression is correlated with ciliary malfunction. AK7 expression was measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. In vitro differentiated nasal human epithelial cell siRNA experiments were performed to investigate the effect of AK7 expression on ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Ciliary motility and ultrastructure were evaluated in a cohort of 29 patients with PCD (PCD, n = 17; Kartagener's syndrome, n = 12) and 26 healthy control donors. AK7 expression was mainly located on the apical surface of differentiated nasal ALI cells, and targeted suppression of the AK7 gene decreased CBF by 41%. AK7 expression was diminished significantly in patients with PCD (0.54 +/- 0.1-fold; p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls (1.1 +/- 0.08-fold). Furthermore, AK7 expression was correlated with CBF in patients with PCD (r = 0.5; p = 0.009). AK7 expression was correlated with CBF in vitro and in nasal biopsy specimens from patients with PCD, which may have contributed to the ciliary malfunction observed in our patients with PCD.

Recent linkage and mutational analyses identified several genes that are responsible for Kartagener syndrome. Most of them encode subunits of axonemal dyneins, highlighting the importance of dynein motors to ciliary motility. Recent data indicate that defects in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport are involved in the etiology of ALS. Genes encoding the dynein heavy chain of cytoplasmic and outer arm axonemal dyneins are reported to have similar sequences in their central and 3'-end regions. Although a causal link between ALS and Kartagener syndrome has not yet been definitely established, the precise relationship between disrupted axonemal dynein function in Kartagener syndrome and motor neuron death should be investigated.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that produces lifelong difficulties with chronic airway inflammation. Little is known about the role of chronic airway inflammation on chloride ion transport properties in PCD. This study assessed the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride (Cl) ion transport properties of freshly excised nasal mucosa from PCD compared with normal and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Electrophysiology study utilizing Ussing type hemi-chamber technique with three different types of nasal tissue (normal, CRS, PCD) obtained from patients during endoscopic surgery at a tertiary referral center. Nasal tissues were examined under short-circuit conditions, and gradient-driven Cl currents were continuously recorded. The cAMP elevating agonist (forskolin) was added to stimulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl secretion. To prevent misinterpretation of flux measurement, Cl transport inhibitors were used at the end of all experiments. Basal Cl currents (I(Cl)) and changes in I(Cl) to forskolin (DeltaI(Cl)) were compared between normal, CRS, and PCD nasal tissues. Forskolin stimulated Cl currents across all different types of nasal epithelia. The Cl secretory response was effectively blocked by the Cl ion transport inhibitors. I(Cl) were significantly higher in normals (155.0 +/- 9.3 microA/cm(2)) compared to CRS (79.1 +/- 15.0 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (70.9 +/- 20.4 microA/cm(2)) (P = .005). DeltaI(Cl) in CRS (14.8 +/- 2.3 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (12.2 +/- 2.4 microA/cm(2)) were markedly diminished compared to normals (28.3 +/- 4.7 microA/cm(2)) (P = .024). PCD tissues were characterized by impaired I(Cl) and DeltaI(Cl). Both parameters were reduced by 54.3% and 56.9% in PCD when compared to normals.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a+-and CD66b+-, but not CD11b+-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.

Patients referred for PCD evaluation were consecutively recruited for 30 months. In addition to standard diagnostic testing for PCD, a computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses was performed in all subjects. 86 patients (46 children aged 8-17 yrs) were studied.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by abnormalities in ciliary structure and/or function. Frequent, intermittent or chronic airway infections precipitated by impaired airway mucociliary clearance may cause permanent lung damage and reduced lung function. Early diagnosis is considered important for the prevention of lung damage, but diagnosis is probably often delayed or even missed since diagnosis of PCD is both complex and time consuming, and yet not always exact. The aims of this PhD thesis were to evaluate the discriminative capacity and ""real-life"" clinical application of two candidates for supplemental diagnostic testing for PCD: Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement placed as a first line test to point out probable PCD patients for further investigation or exclude patients, regardless of age, Pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance (PRMC) as a second line test for PCD investigation in children from 5 years of age. And additionally, Proposing an algorithm for the pathway of diagnosing PCD based on these two studies and recommendations from the literature. Nasal NO and PRMC demonstrated to be two highly valid supplementary diagnostic tools to be placed in each end of the diagnostic pathway when investigating selected patients referred for PCD work up. Nasal NO measurement demonstrated to have an obvious place as a first line test in the pathway of PCD investigation and PRMC as second line test as a supplement to ciliary function test and EM-test in cases of difficult diagnoses. Neither of these tests can stand alone in diagnosis or excluding of PCD. PCD remains to be a diagnosis that should be made at a tertiary PCD centre, as clinical evaluation of referred patients is crucial before excluding the disease.

The joi mutation was caused by genomic insertion of the medaka transposon, Tol1. In the joi mutant, cilia in Kupffer's vesicle (KV), an organ functionally equivalent to the mouse node in terms of left-right (LR) specification, are generated but their motility is disrupted, resulting in a LR defect. Ultrastructural analysis revealed severe reduction in the outer dynein arms in KV cilia of joi mutants. We also found the other dnai2 gene in the medaka genome.

A statistically significant relationship between nNO level and age was demonstrated in this study group of pre-school children (p < 0.001). An increase in nNO of about 100 ppb was observed in children older than 6 yr vs. those aged < 3. This study presents a description of normal nNO values in pre-school children. The effect of the age and the eventual presence of rhinitis and snoring need to be considered whenever nNO is evaluated in the clinical practice, in particular in non-cooperative children.

21131972	"CCDC39 is required for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex and for normal ciliary motility in humans and dogs
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, reduced fertility in males and situs inversus in about 50% of affected individuals (Kartagener syndrome). It is caused by motility defects in the respiratory cilia that are responsible for airway clearance, the flagella that propel sperm cells and the nodal monocilia that determine left-right asymmetry. Recessive mutations that cause PCD have been identified in genes encoding components of the outer dynein arms, radial spokes and cytoplasmic pre-assembly factors of axonemal dyneins, but these mutations account for only about 50% of cases of PCD. We exploited the unique properties of dog populations to positionally clone a new PCD gene, CCDC39. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the human ortholog underlie a substantial fraction of PCD cases with axonemal disorganization and abnormal ciliary beating. Functional analyses indicated that CCDC39 localizes to ciliary axonemes and is essential for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex.

"	"To determine the efficacy of our nasal brush biopsy technique to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia. Retrospective chart review at an urban children's hospital. We obtained medical records of all patients who underwent an endoscopic guided ciliary brush biopsy from January 2000 to June 2008. Data recorded included the procedure date, biopsy location, presence of motility on light microscopy, and whether specimen was sent for electron microscopy and those results. Sixty pediatric patients between the ages of 16 months and 17.3 years with chronic sinusitis (35 males, 25 females) were identified. Three were excluded because biopsies were taken from a non nasal location. Forty-seven specimens had light microscopy evaluation only, as normal motile cilia were identified. Ten had haphazard or absent motility and required further evaluation with electron microscopy. Electron microscopy ruled out defects for three samples, was non-diagnostic for five, and the remaining two reports could not be found. Overall, in 47/57 (82%) cases, light microscopy alone ruled out primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Using both methods, there was a 91% success rate in ruling out PCD. Obtaining an endoscopic biopsy with a cytosoft cytology brush (Camarillo California) from the posterior portion of the inferior turbinate gave sufficient specimen to examine for PCD. Light microscopy alone or in concert with evaluation by electron microscopy confirmed normal cilia in 91% of specimens ruling out the diagnosis of PCD. The algorithm suggested is simple and has high success in allowing the clinician to exclude the diagnosis of PCD in the patient with chronic or recurrent upper respiratory infections.

"	"No study has evaluated the correlation between different expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms in nasal epithelial cells and nasal NO (nNO) level in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Gene expression of endothelial (NOS3) and inducible NOS (NOS2) and their correlation with nNO level, ciliary function and morphology were studied in patients with PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). NOS3 gene polymorphisms were studied in blood leukocytes. A total of 212 subjects were studied (48 with PCD, 161 with SCD and three normal subjects). nNO level correlated with mean ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.044; r = 0.174). The lower the nNO level the higher was the percentage of immotile cilia (p<0.001; r = -0.375). A significant positive correlation between NOS2 gene expression and nNO levels was demonstrated in all children (p = 0.001; r = 0.428), and this correlation was confirmed in patients with PCD (p = 0.019; r = 0.484). NOS2 gene expression was lower in PCD than in SCD (p = 0.04). The NOS3 isoform correlated with missing central microtubules (p = 0.048; r = 0.447). nNO levels were higher in PCD subjects with the NOS3 thymidine 894 mutation, and this was associated with a higher ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.045). These results demonstrate a relationship between nNO level, NOS mRNA expression and ciliary beat frequency.

"	"Examination of ciliary ultrastructure remains the cornerstone diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of abnormal ciliary structure and/or function. Obtaining a biopsy with sufficient interpretable cilia and producing quality transmission electron micrographs (TEM) is challenging. Methods for processing tissues for optimal preservation of axonemal structures are not standardized. This study describes our experience using a standard operating procedure (SOP) for collecting nasal scrape biopsies and processing TEMs in a centralized laboratory. We enrolled patients with suspected PCD at research sites of the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium. Biopsies were performed according to a SOP whereby curettes were used to scrape the inferior surface of the inferior turbinate, with samples placed in fixative. Specimens were shipped to a central laboratory where TEMs were prepared and blindly reviewed. Four hundred forty-eight specimens were obtained from 107 young children (0-5 years), 189 older children (5-18 years), and 152 adults (> 18 years), and 88% were adequate for formal interpretation. The proportion of adequate specimens was higher in adults than in children. Fifty percent of the adequate TEMs showed normal ciliary ultrastructure, 39% showed hallmark ultrastructural changes of PCD, and 11% had indeterminate findings. Among specimens without clearly normal ultrastructure, 72% had defects of the outer and/or inner dynein arms (IDA), while 7% had central apparatus defects with or without IDA defects. In summary, nasal scrape biopsies can be performed in the outpatient setting and yield interpretable samples, when performed by individuals with adequate training and experience according to an SOP.

The present study was an audit of all patients referred for PCD diagnostic testing over a 3-yr period whose initial electron microscopy (EM) and beat pattern analysis suggested an inner dynein arm or radial spoke defect. 21 patients referred for diagnostic testing for PCD suspected of an inner dynein arm defect and six suspected of a radial spoke defect on initial EM and beat pattern analysis had repeat testing performed. On repeat testing, five patients initially suspected of an inner dynein arm defect and one with a radial spoke defect had normal EM and beat pattern, leading to the initial diagnosis being questioned. Patients suspected of PCD due to an inner dynein arm defect or radial spoke defect should have the diagnosis reassessed if it has been based on only one diagnostic sample.

"	"Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is assessed by nasal aspiration/insufflation via one nostril or by nasal silent exhalation through a facemask and is also measured during humming, a manoeuvre that results in increased nNO in the presence of a patent osteomeatal complex. Humming nNO peak is absent in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hand-held devices are used successfully for exhaled or nNO analysis. No study compared nNO during silent and humming exhalation using hand-held and stationary analysers. Thirty-eight subjects (14 PCD; 11 CF; 13 healthy individuals) measured nNO with a stationary and a hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalations. No difference between nNO obtained from stationary or hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalation was found (P > 0·05). Patients with PCD exhibited lower silent and humming nNO than CF or controls (P < 0·001). During both silent and humming exhalation, there was a significant correlation between nNO from the two analyzers both in the whole study population and within each group (r ≥ 0·7, P < 0·01). Bland-Altman plots confirmed this agreement. Using the hand-held device during humming, nNO values of 50, 81 and 21 ppb had sensitivity and specificity > 90% for discriminating PCD or CF from healthy subjects, and patients with PCD from patients with CF, respectively. The hand-held device is as effective as the stationary analyzer for assessing nNO during silent and humming exhalation. Its wider use might result in an increased number of subjects suspected to have PCD.

In the first case, the mirrored anatomy of the right atrium was reconstructed using three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping, which guided successful ablation of a typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. In the second case, computerized tomography showed the presence of left atrial isomerism with interruption of the inferior vena cava and azygous continuation into the superior vena cava, guiding advancement of the ablation catheter for access into the positionally right atrial ablation site. These cases illustrate the role of imaging in patients with unusual anatomy of the cardiac chambers and major blood vessels guiding optimal catheter access for catheter ablation.

"	"Recently, it has been suggested that misprojections of the temporal retina to the contralateral hemisphere might not be specific for patients with albinism and might also be associated with the Kartagener syndrome (i.e., with situs inversus totalis in the presence of primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). The authors tested whether such projection abnormalities are associated with PCD and situs inversus. In 10 patients with PCD (five with situs inversus totalis) and in 10 age- and sex-matched controls, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded monocularly, as follows: conventional pattern-onset VEPs (cVEPs) and multifocal VEPs (mfVEPs) for 60 locations constituting a visual field of 44° diameter. cVEPs from 13 albinotic subjects were included as a reference. For each eye, interhemispheric difference potentials were calculated and correlated with each other to assess the lateralization of the responses: positive and negative correlation coefficients indicated lateralizations on same or opposite hemispheres, respectively. Misrouted optic nerves are expected to yield negative interocular correlations. For both cVEPs and mfVEPs, the distribution of the correlation coefficients in the PCD patients yielded largely positive values and did not differ from that of the controls. Consequently, neither large- nor small-scale lateralization abnormalities were observed in PCD. Further, the optic nerve projection did not depend on the presence of situs inversus. The absence of evidence for projection abnormalities in a cohort of 10 subjects with PCD, five of whom had Kartagener syndrome, underscores that misrouting of the optic nerves is not a common trait of these subjects.

"	"Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is a reliable non-invasive screening test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but the recommended technique, exhalation against resistance (ER), requires cooperation limiting its use in young children. Our objectives were to determine whether easier non-velum closure techniques have the ability to discriminate PCD and longitudinal reproducibility. We conducted a case-control study evaluating 5 breathing techniques (ER, breath hold, tidal breathing mouth open, tidal breathing mouth closed, and humming) for measuring nNO in patients with PCD compared with control subjects (cystic fibrosis [CF], non-PCD non-CF bronchiectasis, and healthy). A subgroup repeated measurements 1 month later. Sensitivity, specificity, and intraclass correlation coefficient of each nNO technique were determined. We tested 85 children (20 PCD, 32 CF, 14 broncheoctasis, and 19 healthy), aged 5 to 18 years (mean age, 11.5 years); 52% of children were male. All breathing techniques discriminated patients with PCD from control subjects with high specificity (>90%), 100% sensitivity, and intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8. nNO output cutoff values for diagnosing PCD varied with techniques (ER, 59 nL/min; breath hold, 61 nL/min; tidal breathing mouth open, 37 nL/min; tidal breathing mouth closed, 30 nL/min; humming, 41 nL/min). Non-velum closure techniques are reproducible and valid to discriminate PCD; however, they generally yield lower values than ER.

With these objectives in mind, the records of 412 patients who visited the pediatric pulmonology clinic within a six-month period were reviewed. The referral diagnoses, consisting mostly of primary ciliary dyskinesia, recurrent lung infections caused by immune deficiency and bronchiectasis, as well as definitive diagnoses were recorded. Tuberculosis (14%), cystic fibrosis (7.8%), bronchiectasis (4.6%), immune deficiency (1.6%), hydatid cyst (2%), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (1%) were the most commonly diagnosed diseases. Final diagnosis in 145 of the 412 patients (35.2%) differed from the referral diagnosis. Consanguineous marriages are encountered more commonly in developing countries like Turkey, leading to an increased incidence of genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dysgenesis, cystic fibrosis and immune deficiencies. Infectious diseases such as hydatid cyst and tuberculosis are also common. In any country in which there is a unique distribution of diseases, in other words, a characteristic and unique disease spectrum, courses and instructional fellowship programs should be arranged accordingly.

21663943	"Expression of nitric oxide synthases in primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Nitric oxide is believed to play a central role in nonspecific defense of upper airways. Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have very low concentration of nasal nitric oxide, which may contribute to the chronic upper airway diseases encountered by these patients. The mechanisms underlying this drop of nasal nitric oxide in primary ciliary dyskinesia are still unknown. The goal of the present work was to study nitric oxide synthases expression in upper airway tissues from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. For this purpose, 5 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and 10 nonallergic age-matched patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia undergoing nasal polypectomy were included. Nasal nitric oxide concentration was measured before polypectomy, and nitric oxide synthase expression and function were studied in nasal polyps. The nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia was lower than that in patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia (13 [9-16] ppb versus 210 [167-254] ppb, P < .0001). Nitric oxide synthase 2 immunostaining was prominent at the apical part of the ciliated epithelial cells and was similar in both groups. Nitric oxide synthase 3 staining was restricted to endothelial cells in both groups. In addition, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase activity was superimposable to nitric oxide synthases 2 and 3 immunostaining, suggesting a preserved NADPH-activity of nitric oxide synthase. We therefore conclude that the drop in nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia is not secondary to the loss of nitric oxide synthase expression.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) results from defects in motile cilia function. Mice homozygous for the mutation big giant head (bgh) have several abnormalities commonly associated with PCD, including hydrocephalus, male infertility, and sinusitis. In the present study, we use a variety of histopathological and cell biological techniques to characterize the bgh phenotype, and we identify the bgh mutation using a positional cloning approach. Histopathological, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic analyses demonstrate that the male infertility results from shortened flagella and disorganized axonemal and accessory structures in elongating spermatids and mature sperm. In addition, there is a reduced number of elongating spermatids during spermatogenesis and mature sperm in the epididymis. Histological analyses show that the hydrocephalus is characterized by severe dilatation of the lateral ventricles and that bgh sinuses have an accumulation of mucus infiltrated by neutrophils. In contrast to the sperm phenotype, electron microscopy demonstrates that mutant respiratory epithelial cilia are ultrastructurally normal, but video microscopic analysis shows that their beat frequency is lower than that of wild-type cilia. Through a positional cloning approach, we identified two sequence variants in the gene encoding sperm flagellar protein 2 (SPEF2), which has been postulated to play an important role in spermatogenesis and flagellar assembly. A causative nonsense mutation was validated by Western blot analysis, strongly suggesting that the bgh phenotype results from the loss of SPEF2 function. Taken together, the data in this study demonstrate that SPEF2 is required for cilia function and identify a new genetic cause of PCD in mice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PCD of a system of high-resolution digital high-speed video analysis with proprietary software that we developed for analysis of ciliary motility (Desinsoft-Bio 200). The secondary aim was to correlate nasal ciliary activity with clinical and structural abnormalities in PCD. We analysed nasal mucociliary transport, cilia ultrastructure, nasal ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern studied by high-resolution digital high-speed video in 25 cases of PCD (11 Kartagener syndrome), 27 secondary ciliary dyskinesia and 34 healthy volunteers. Nasal mucociliary transport was defective in both primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Ciliary immotility was observed only in 6 patients with Kartagener syndrome and correlated with the absence of dynein. We observed a correlation between partial dynein deficiencies and ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia activity and structure was normal in secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Nasal mucociliary transport showed high sensitivity for PCD diagnosis with a low specificity. High-resolution digital high-speed video has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PCD. This system of video analysis is more useful than ultrastructural study and mucociliary transport for PCD screening. Dynein absence is correlated with cilia immotility and is more common in patients with Kartagener syndrome.

We retrospectively evaluated two paired spirometry and HRCT examinations from 20 PCD patients (age, 11.6 years; range, 6.5-27.5 years). The evaluations were performed in stable state and during unstable lung disease. HRCT scans were scored blind by two raters. Compared to the first assessment, at the second evaluation spirometry did not change while HRCT scores significantly worsened (P < 0.01). Age was significantly related to HRCT total (r = 0.5; P = 0.02) and bronchiectasis scores (r = 0.5; P = 0.02). At both evaluations, HRCT total score correlated with FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.01; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.006; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively), and bronchiectasis score was related to FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.03; r = -0.6; P = 0.002, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.008; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively). No relationship was found between the change in HRCT scores and the change in spirometry. In PCD, structural lung disease may worsen despite spirometry being stable.

Human disease loci have been identified but a mouse model without additional deleterious defects is elusive. The inversus viscerum mouse, mutated at the outer arm dynein heavy chain 11 locus (Dnahc11) is a known model of heterotaxy. We demonstrated immotile tracheal cilia with normal ultrastructure and reduced sperm motility in the Dnahc11(iv) mouse. This is accompanied by gross rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis media, all indicators of human PCD. Strikingly, age-related progression of the disease is evident. The Dnahc11(iv) mouse is robust, lacks secondary defects, and requires no intervention to precipitate the phenotype. Together these findings show the Dnahc11(iv) mouse to be an excellent model of many aspects of human PCD. Mutation of the homologous human locus has previously been associated with hyperkinetic tracheal cilia in PCD. Two PCD patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure, one with immotile and one with hyperkinetic cilia were found to carry DNAH11 mutations. Three novel DNAH11 mutations were detected indicating that this gene should be investigated in patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure and static, as well as hyperkinetic cilia.

Eight age- and body mass index-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Main variables were forced expiratory volume at 1 s, peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak) ) and time spent in PA. Forty per cent of patients with PCD had impaired lung function as expressed by FEV(1) < 85% predicted. Only patients with impaired lung function exhibited reduced VO(2peak) (18·1 ± 7·9 mL/kg/min). Time spent in total daily PA was slightly lower in patients than controls, with no difference between patients with normal or reduced lung function. In multiple regression models, male gender (β = 0·518, P = 0·018), age (β = 0·752, P = 0·035) and time spent in vigorous PA (β = 0·353, P = 0·049) were independent predictors of aerobic fitness. Assessment of resting pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary functional capacity could contribute to the evaluation of pulmonary impairment in PCD. Given the benefit of physical exercise on airway clearance and on general health and quality of life, patients with PCD should be encouraged to adopt an active lifestyle.

"	"The examination of ciliary ultrastructure in a nasal sample remains a definitive diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The quantitative assessment of ciliary ultrastructure in the diagnosis of PCD over a 20-year period was reviewed. During this period, 1182 patients were referred for ciliary ultrastructural analysis, 242 (20%) of whom were confirmed as having the disease. The two main causes of PCD identified were a lack of outer dynein arms (43%) and a lack of both inner and outer dynein arms (24%). Other causes included transposition, radial spoke and inner dynein arm defects. No specific ultrastructural defects were detected in 33 patients (3%) diagnosed as having PCD on the basis of their clinical features and screening tests that included a low nasal nitric oxide concentration or slow saccharine clearance and abnormal ciliary beat frequency or pattern. Electron microscopy analysis can confirm but does not always exclude a diagnosis of PCD.

22157010	"Functional architecture of the outer arm dynein conformational switch.
"	"Dynein light chain 1 (LC1/DNAL1) is one of the most highly conserved components of ciliary axonemal outer arm dyneins, and it associates with both a heavy chain motor unit and tubulin located within the A-tubule of the axonemal outer doublet microtubules. In a variety of model systems, lack of LC1 or expression of mutant forms leads to profound defects in ciliary motility, including the failure of the hydrodynamic coupling needed for ciliary metachronal synchrony, random stalling during the power/recovery stroke transition, an aberrant response to imposed viscous load, and in some cases partial failure of motor assembly. These phenotypes have led to the proposal that LC1 acts as part of a mechanical switch to control motor function in response to alterations in axonemal curvature. Here we have used NMR chemical shift mapping to define the regions perturbed by a series of mutations in the C-terminal domain that yield a range of phenotypic effects on motility. In addition, we have identified the subdomain of LC1 involved in binding microtubules and characterized the consequences of an Asn → Ser alteration within the terminal leucine-rich repeat that in humans causes primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together, these data define a series of functional subdomains within LC1 and allow us to propose a structural model for the organization of the dynein heavy chain-LC1-microtubule ternary complex that is required for the coordinated activity of dynein motors in cilia.

22218906	"Assessing PCP in the cochlea of mammalian ciliopathy models
"	"The increased availability of mouse models of human genetic ciliary diseases has led to advances in our understanding of the diverse cellular roles played by cilia. The family of so-called ""ciliopathies"" includes Alström Syndrome, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, and Polycystic Kidney Disease, among many others. In mouse models of Alström Syndrome and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, we have shown developmental defects in the mechano-sensory stereociliary bundles on the apical surfaces of ""hair"" cells in the cochlea, the mammalian hearing organ. Stereocilia are specialized actin-based microvilli, whose characteristic patterning is thought to be dependent on the hair cell's primary cilium (""kinocilium""). Ciliopathy-associated proteins are localized to the ciliary axoneme and/or the ciliary basal body, or to the bundle itself. Ciliopathy-associated genes functionally interact with genes of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, and so implicate PCP in the control of hair cell development.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetically heterogenous condition. Mutations in DNAH5 or DNAI1 genes can be found in about a third of the patients with PCD. Increased occurrence of mutations was described in several exons of these long genes. The objective of the study was to test the sensitivity of sequencing of selected 13 exons (as compared to costly sequencing of all 100 exons of the two genes), and to determine the prevalence of the DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations in the Czech PCD database. The Czech national PCD database has identified 31 pediatric patients, diagnosed based on clinical findings and tests on the ciliated epithelium. Twenty-seven patients from 24 families agreed on genetic testing. In the first step, direct sequencing of selected 13 exons (9 of DNAH5 and 4 of DNAI1) was performed, and then we compared its effectiveness in detecting at least one mutation with results of sequencing all 100 exons of the two genes. The sequencing of all exons identified compound heterozygosity for PCD mutations in nine patients from eight families (DNAH5 in eight and DNAI1 in one patient), and heterozygozity for a DNAH5 mutation of uncertain functional significance in one additional patient. The first step of selected exon sequencing detected a mutation in five out of these eight families, its actual sensitivity being 62.5%, with a high predictive value. The phenotypic and clinical characteristics of all the paediatric patients with PCD are shown. Selected exon sequencing detects at least one mutated allele in over a half of our patients who have PCD due to DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations. To lower the costs of the genetic testing, targeted step-wise genetic testing may be a reasonable approach to detect mutations in PCD patients, especially if their phenotype is taken into account.

"	"Functional and structural lung evaluations are part of the follow-up of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We aimed to evaluate transversal and longitudinal relationships between lung function test (LFT) and chest computed tomography (CT) in children with PCD, in stable clinical condition. Data from children followed in the French National Center were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were (i) definitive diagnosis of PCD, (ii) age less than 15 years at the beginning of follow-up, (iii) at least 8 years of follow-up, (iv) at least two couples of concurrent CT and LFT available in a phase of clinical stability of the lung disease without modification of the treatment regimen in the last 4 weeks. Twenty children (median age at entry 4.6 years, median follow-up 15.4 years) were included. Concurrent LFT (blood gas and spirometry) and CT (score) results were recorded. LFT indices (PaO(2) (n = 210), FVC, FEV(1) , FEF(2575%) (n = 195)) significantly decreased with age, and the mean annual decrease (z-score (% predicted)) was -0.17 (-0.49%), -0.09 (-0.50%), -0.10 (-0.89%), and -0.07 (-1.73%), respectively. First CT (median age 8.7 years) revealed bronchiectasis (70%), mucous plugging (70%), peribronchial thickening (90%), parenchymal abnormalities (65%), and hyperinflation (50%). CT scores (n = 74) significantly increased with age, and was negatively correlated to PaO(2), FVC, FEV(1), and FEF(2575%) longitudinal changes. In stable clinical condition, functional, and structural progressive impairments significantly correlated in children with PCD. Further prospective studies, including large populations of patients with various levels of disease severity, are needed to confirm whether lung function follow-up can be used to adjust CT frequency and help at minimizing the radiation burden in children with a good life expectancy.

"	"CCDC39 and CCDC40 genes have recently been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects and axonemal disorganisation; their contribution to the disease is, however, unknown. Aiming to delineate the CCDC39/CCDC40 mutation spectrum and associated phenotypes, this study screened a large cohort of patients with IDA defects, in whom clinical and ciliary phenotypes were accurately described. All CCDC39 and CCDC40 exons and intronic boundaries were sequenced in 43 patients from 40 unrelated families. The study recorded and compared clinical features (sex, origin, consanguinity, laterality defects, ages at first symptoms and at phenotype evaluation, neonatal respiratory distress, airway infections, nasal polyposis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, infertility), ciliary beat frequency, and quantitative ultrastructural analyses of cilia and sperm flagella. Biallelic CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations were identified in 30/34 (88.2%) unrelated families with IDA defects associated with axonemal disorganisation (22 and eight families, respectively). Fourteen of the 28 identified mutations are novel. No mutation was found in the six families with isolated IDA defects. Patients with identified mutations shared a similar phenotype, in terms of both clinical features and ciliary structure and function. The sperm flagellar ultrastructure, analysed in 4/7 infertile males, showed evidence of abnormalities similar to the ciliary ones. CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations represent the major cause of PCD with IDA defects and axonemal disorganisation. Patients carrying CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations are phenotypically indistinguishable. CCDC39 and CCDC40 analyses in selected patients ensure mutations are found with high probability, even if clinical or ciliary phenotypes cannot prioritise one analysis over the other.

"	"Otitis media with effusion (OME) in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is recurrent and persistent and presents a complex clinical problem for otolaryngologists. We sought to review the otological presentation of children with PCD treated medically and surgically and to compare audiological outcomes and complications of surgical and medical management in children with PCD and correlate these findings with known PCD ultrastructural ciliary phenotype. A retrospective review was performed of all patients with PCD and OME presenting from 1991 to 2009. Patients were grouped into ""medical management"" and ""ventilation tube (VT) insertion"" groups to observe changes in hearing and post-operative complications. Of 31 patients with PCD and OME, 20 received VTs and 11 were treated by medical management strategies. A median of one set of VTs (range 1-5) were inserted per patient. Hearing thresholds improved to normal (<25 dB HL) in 80% ears with VTs (mean improvement from 27.1 dB to 22.1 dB (p=0.034)), whereas patients managed medically had stable thresholds (22.7-23.6 dB (p=0.397) over the study period. At least one episode of post-operative otorrhea occurred in eight (42.1%) VT insertion patients during the study period, and four had multiple episodes. We could not demonstrate any differences in post-surgical outcomes between patient groups based on ultrastructural ciliary phenotype. Otorrhea was well controlled with medical therapy with only one requiring tube removal. Bilateral cholesteatoma was found in two patients. Our data support the use of VT insertion as an option for patients with PCD and OME with mild to moderate hearing loss. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of multiple insertions and the likelihood of post-operative otorrhea, although this was not very troublesome in our group. Ultrastructural ciliary phenotype did not appear to alter the likelihood of post-operative otorrhea in our series. Cholesteatoma should be considered as a potential cause of otorrhea in PCD.

"	"RPGR gene encodes retinitis pigmentosa guanosine triphosphatase regulator protein, mutations of which cause 70% of the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) cases. Rarely, RPGR mutations can also cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and male subfertility. Two patients with PCD\_RP and their relatives were analyzed using DNA sequencing, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), photometry, and high-speed videomicroscopy. The Polish patient carried a previously known c.154G>A substitution (p.Gly52Arg) in exon 2 (known to affect splicing); the mutation was co-segregating with the XLRP symptoms in his family. The c.824 G>T mutation (p. Gly275Val) in the Australian patient was a de novo mutation. In both patients, TEM and IF did not reveal any changes in the respiratory cilia structure. However, following ciliogenesis in vitro, in contrast to the ciliary beat frequency, the ciliary beat coordination in the spheroids from the Polish proband and his relatives carrying the c.154G>A mutation was reduced. Analysis of the ciliary alignment indicated severely disturbed orientation of cilia. Therefore, we confirm that defects in the RPGR protein may contribute to syndromic PCD. Lack of ultrastructural defects in respiratory cilia of the probands, the reduced ciliary orientation and the decreased coordination of the ciliary bundles observed in the Polish patient suggested that the RPGR protein may play a role in the establishment of the proper respiratory cilia orientation.

The most important anesthetic implications of Kartegener's syndrome surgery are assessement of pulmonary and cardiac structure and function. We present a case of 43-year-old woman with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and bilateral sectetory otitis media. The chest radiograph and CT scans showed dextrocardia and situs inversus with chronic bronchitis without bronchiectasis. Spirometry showed forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.66 L and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.62 L. Electroechography showed no cardiac abnormalities with 55-60% of EF. The anesthetic implications of Kartagener's syndrome are varied. The regional or general anesthesia might be involved with sinus surgery, ear surgery, pulmonary surgery, infertility or abdominal and cardiac surgery. The main anesthetic considerations among patients with Kartagener's syndrome are related to the pulmonary function which include preoperative respiratory infections due to bronchiectasis. We should also monitor potentially occluded congenital heart diseases. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare disease and when the patient need an operation we have to consider surgery with regional or general anesthesia. The general anesthesia would be safe after complete preanaesthetic examination of the patient. The ECG, chest CT scans, spirometry and echocardiography are mandatory before the operation.

"	"Airway cilia depend on precise changes in shape to transport the mucus gel overlying mucosal surfaces. The ciliary motion can be recorded in several planes using video microscopy. However, cilia are densely packed, and automated computerized systems are not available to convert these ciliary shape changes into forms that are useful for testing theoretical models of ciliary function. We developed a system for converting planar ciliary motions recorded by video microscopy into an empirical quantitative model, which is easy to use in validating mathematical models, or in examining ciliary function, e.g., in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The system we developed allows the manipulation of a model cilium superimposed over a video of beating cilia. Data were analyzed to determine shear angles and velocity vectors of points along the cilium. Extracted waveforms were used to construct a composite waveform, which could be used as a standard. Variability was measured as the mean difference in position of points on individual waveforms and the standard. The shapes analyzed were the end-recovery, end-effective, and fastest moving effective and recovery with mean (± SE) differences of 0.31(0.04), 0.25(0.06), 0.50(0.12), 0.50(0.10), μm, respectively. In contrast, the same measures for three different PCD waveforms had values far outside this range.

During the validation process, we focused on rod-shaped bacteria as surrogates for M. tuberculosis. The Cough Cylinder enabled us to sample Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and mycobacteria from aerosols produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and tuberculosis. Pathogens in droplets and in airborne particles could be sampled. Delayed air sampling allowed specific measurement of persistent airborne particles. This novel experimental system allows measurement of aerosol pathogen spread in a highly standardised fashion. It also offers the possibility to assess the impact of different interventions to limit aerosol transmission.

"	"The Cilia represent one of the main mechanisms contributing to the clearance of microorganisms and particles from the respiratory epithelium. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically determined disorder characterized by irreversible systemic dysmotility of the cilia. Secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) differs from primary defects on the reversible ultrastructural alterations that can occur after any insult to a previously normal mucosa. Hence, this study aimed to describe and compare the main ultrastructural ciliary features in PCD and SCD through transmission electron microscopy. The most frequent PCD abnormalities were missing or short dynein arms, missing central microtubules, and displacement of one of the nine peripheral doublets. The most common changes found in SCD were compound cilia and peripheral microtubule alterations associated with modifications of the respiratory epithelium. PCD presented a higher percentage of altered cilia (>30 %) when compared to SCD (5 %), demonstrating that SCD is more limited in area than PCD. Whereas in PCD the changes in the dynein arms and in the central microtubules are fundamental for diagnostic confirmation, the diagnosis of SCD usually involves compound cilia and disarrangements in peripheral microtubules.

This observational study was conducted at the Department of Pediatrics and Physiology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from January 2011 to December 2011. The study population consisted of 22 children with symptoms suggestive of PCD and the diagnosis was confirmed by ciliary biopsy. Using the American Thoracic Society guidelines, measurements of FENO were performed in 22 subjects with proven PCD biopsies and in 11 healthy age-matched subjects. No significant differences were found on the basis of age or ventilatory function tests between the PCD patients and control groups. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide values were significantly lower in children with PCD (6.19+/-1.43) compared to control group (17.00+/-6.30) (CI: -14.854 to -5.927, p<0.0001). Rhinorrhea was seen in 7 (31.8%), recurrent acute otitis media in 16 (72.7%), chronic otitis media in 5 (22.7%), recurrent sinusitis in 5 (22.7%), chronic productive cough in 8 (36.4%), bronchospasm in 11 (50%), and dextrocardia in 3 (13.6%) subjects. There was no correlation between age, FENO, and ventilatory function parameters. The measurement of FENO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD. It can complement other tests such as nasal biopsy and electron microscopy studies.

"	"Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz. Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal (frequency range 34 to 52 Hz) and respiratory epithelial cells (frequency 3 to 18 Hz) were captured using a high-speed digital video recorder. To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system. The overall mean difference (± SD) between the ciliaFA and direct measurement high-speed digital imaging methods was -0.05 ± 1.25 Hz, the correlation coefficient was shown to be 0.991 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from -1.99 to 1.49 Hz for respiratory and from -2.55 to 3.25 Hz for ependymal cilia. A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) using Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias. We have included free access to the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use.

Loss-of-function mutations disrupting DRC1 result in severe defects in assembly of the N-DRC structure and defective ciliary movement in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and humans. Our results highlight a role for N-DRC integrity in regulating ciliary beating and provide the first direct evidence that mutations in DRC genes cause human disease.

23418344	"Sperm-associated antigen-17 gene is essential for motile cilia function and neonatal survival
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting from defects in cilia assembly or motility, is caused by mutations in a number of genes encoding axonemal proteins. PCD phenotypes are variable, and include recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, hydrocephaly, situs inversus, and male infertility. We generated knockout mice for the sperm-associated antigen-17 (Spag17) gene, which encodes a central pair (CP) protein present in the axonemes of cells with ""9 + 2"" motile cilia or flagella. The targeting of Spag17 resulted in a severe phenotype characterized by immotile nasal and tracheal cilia, reduced clearance of nasal mucus, profound respiratory distress associated with lung fluid accumulation and disruption of the alveolar epithelium, cerebral ventricular expansion consistent with emerging hydrocephalus, failure to suckle, and neonatal demise within 12 hours of birth. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the loss of one CP microtubule in approximately one quarter of tracheal cilia axonemes, an absence of a C1 microtubule projection, and other less frequent CP structural abnormalities. SPAG6 and SPAG16 (CP proteins that interact with SPAG17) were increased in tracheal tissue from SPAG17-deficient mice. We conclude that Spag17 plays a critical role in the function and structure of motile cilia, and that neonatal lethality is likely explained by impaired airway mucociliary clearance.

"	"Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement is an established first line test in the work-up for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Tidal breathing nNO (TB-nNO) measurements require minimal cooperation and are potentially useful even in young children. Hand-held NO devices are becoming increasingly widespread for asthma management. Therefore, we chose to assess whether hand-held TB-nNO measurements reliably discriminate between PCD, and Healthy Subjects (HS) and included Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients as a disease control group known to have intermediate nNO levels. In this cross sectional, single centre, single occasion, proof-of-concept study in children and adults with PCD and CF, and in HS we compared feasibility, success rates, discriminatory capacity, repeatability and agreement between a hand-held electrochemical device equipped with a nNO software application sampling at flow rates 2 ml/s or 5 ml/s, and two stationary chemiluminescence devices, applying both tidal breathing and velum closure techniques. Measurements were done in 16 PCD patients, 21 patients with CF and 20 HS aged between 3.8 and 60.9 years. Hand-held TB-nNO showed high success rate (96.5-100%) vs. velum closure nNO techniques (70.2-89.5%). Hand-held TB-nNO sampling at flow rate 5 ml/s showed equally high discriminative power (PCD vs. HS [p<0.0001] and PCD vs. CF [p<0.0001]) and reaching close to 100% sensitivity and specificity, superior repeatability (CV% = 10%) and equal limits of agreement compared to TB-nNO by stationary devices and even compared to velum closure sampling. Hand-held TB-nNO discriminates significantly between PCD, CF and HS and shows promising potential as a widespread targeted case-finding tool for PCD, although further studies are warranted before implementation.

"	"The study of nasal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and ultrastructure may contribute to the understanding of pathognomonic cases of male infertility associated with defects in sperm motility. This study was designed to report a particular case of male infertility, characterized by the association of two respiratory autosomal recessive genetic diseases (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency [AAT-D] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). A 39-year-old patient with complete sperm immotility, AAT-D, and bronchiectasis was studied in the Laboratory of Male Fertility, the Department of Urology, the Respiratory Center of a Pediatric Hospital, and in the Department of Clinical Medicine of a Rehabilitation Respiratory Hospital. Family history, physical examination, hormonal analysis, microbial assays, semen analysis, nasal ciliary function, and structure study by digital high-speed video photography and transmission electron microscopy are described. A noninvasive nasal biopsy to retrieve ciliated epithelium lining the inferior surface of the inferior nasal turbinates was performed and CBF was determined. Beat pattern was slightly curved and rigid, not wide, and metacronic in all the observed fields analyzed. CBF was 8.2 Hz in average (reference value, 10-15 Hz) Ultrastructural assay revealed absence of the inner dynein arms in 97% of the cilia observed. The final infertility accurate diagnosis was achieved by the study of nasal CBF and ultrastructure contributing to the patient health management and genetic counseling while deciding fatherhood. Beyond this particular case, the present report may open a new field of studies in male infertility, mainly in cases of asthenozoospermia.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, respiratory distress in term neonates, laterality (situs) defects, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities seen by electron microscopy. Mutations in radial spoke head proteins occur in PCD patients with central apparatus defects. Advances in genetic testing have been crucial in addressing the diagnostic challenge. Here, we describe a novel splice-site mutation (c.921+3_6delAAGT) in RSPH4A, which leads to a premature translation termination signal in nine subjects with PCD (seven families). Loss-of-function was confirmed with quantitative ciliary ultrastructural analysis, measurement of ciliary beat frequency and waveform, and transcript analysis. All nine individuals carrying c.921+3_6delAAGT splice-site mutation in RSPH4A were Hispanic with ancestry tracing to Puerto Rico. This mutation is a founder mutation and a common cause of PCD without situs abnormalities in patients of Puerto Rican descent.

"	"DYX1C1 has been associated with dyslexia and neuronal migration in the developing neocortex. Unexpectedly, we found that deleting exons 2-4 of Dyx1c1 in mice caused a phenotype resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic airway disease, laterality defects and male infertility. This phenotype was confirmed independently in mice with a Dyx1c1 c.T2A start-codon mutation recovered from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. Morpholinos targeting dyx1c1 in zebrafish also caused laterality and ciliary motility defects. In humans, we identified recessive loss-of-function DYX1C1 mutations in 12 individuals with PCD. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analyses of DYX1C1-mutant motile cilia in mice and humans showed disruptions of outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs, respectively). DYX1C1 localizes to the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells, its interactome is enriched for molecular chaperones, and it interacts with the cytoplasmic ODA and IDA assembly factor DNAAF2 (KTU). Thus, we propose that DYX1C1 is a newly identified dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF4).

"	"Multiple causes for tree-in-bud (TIB) opacities have been reported. However, to our knowledge the relative frequencies of the causes have not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative frequency of causes of TIB opacities and identify patterns of disease associated with TIB opacities. Cases with TIB opacities in the radiology report in 2010 were identified by searching the Radiology Information System. Medical records and CT scan examinations were reviewed for the causes of TIB opacities. Patterns of disease associated with TIB opacities were evaluated. Causes for TIB opacities were established in 166 of 406 (40.9%) cases. Respiratory infections (119 of 166, 72%) with mycobacteria (65 of 166, 39%), bacteria (44 of 166, 27%), viruses (four of 166, 3%), or multiple organisms (six of 166, 4%) were most common. Aspiration was the cause in 42 of 166 (25%). Alternating areas of normal lung with regions of small airways disease (TIB opacities, bronchiectasis) (random small airways pattern) was specific (0.92) for Mycobacterium avium complex infection. Nearly uniform distribution of bronchiectasis (widespread bronchiectasis pattern) was specific for ""diseases predisposing to airway infection"" (specificity 0.92), such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and immunodeficiency states. Consolidation and TIB opacities (bronchopneumonia pattern) were usually due to bacterial infection or aspiration. Dependent distribution (specificity 0.79) and esophageal abnormality (specificity 0.86) with TIB opacities were associated with aspiration. Chronicity of findings was associated with mycobacterial infection (P &lt; .0001, sensitivity 0.96). Acuteness of findings was associated with bacterial infection (P &lt; .001, specificity 0.87). TIB opacities are most often a manifestation of infections or aspiration. Patterns of disease can provide clues to the most likely diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 20 genes, but collectively they account for only ∼65% of all PCDs. To identify mutations in additional genes that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on three unrelated probands with ciliary outer and inner dynein arm (ODA+IDA) defects. Mutations in SPAG1 were identified in one family with three affected siblings. Further screening of SPAG1 in 98 unrelated affected individuals (62 with ODA+IDA defects, 35 with ODA defects, 1 without available ciliary ultrastructure) revealed biallelic loss-of-function mutations in 11 additional individuals (including one sib-pair). All 14 affected individuals with SPAG1 mutations had a characteristic PCD phenotype, including 8 with situs abnormalities. Additionally, all individuals with mutations who had defined ciliary ultrastructure had ODA+IDA defects. SPAG1 was present in human airway epithelial cell lysates but was not present in isolated axonemes, and immunofluorescence staining showed an absence of ODA and IDA proteins in cilia from an affected individual, thus indicating that SPAG1 probably plays a role in the cytoplasmic assembly and/or trafficking of the axonemal dynein arms. Zebrafish morpholino studies of spag1 produced cilia-related phenotypes previously reported for PCD-causing mutations in genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins. Together, these results demonstrate that mutations in SPAG1 cause PCD with ciliary ODA+IDA defects and that exome sequencing is useful to identify genetic causes of heterogeneous recessive disorders.

"	"Impaired mucociliary clearance causes pulmonary disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Although the sinopulmonary disease is similar, morbidity and mortality are different. Both patients with PCD and patients with CF with pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS) show no nutrient malabsorption and are diagnosed at a later age compared with patients with CF with pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI). Clinical status, microbiology, FEV1, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans presented as total Brody score (CT-TBS) were compared for patients with PCD, CF-PI, and CF-PS, all treated at the same medical center, by the same team, and by a similar routine follow-up. One hundred sixty-four patients, 34 with PCD, 88 with CF-PI, and 42 with CF-PS were enrolled. PCD was diagnosed at a similar age as CF-PS but significantly later than CF-PI. Mean FEV1 % predicted was similar for the three groups. The rate of FEV1 change with age in PCD was similar to CF-PS but significantly lower than in CF-PI. Severity of structural lung disease (CT-TBS) was similar for PCD and CF-PS and significantly higher in CF-PI. No correlation between TBS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and FEV1 in PCD was seen, whereas a negative correlation with FEV1 was observed for both CF groups. Although in our study PCD was similar to CF-PS, the lack of correlation between FEV1 and age, CT-TBS, and P aeruginosa infection in PCD suggests that impaired mucociliary clearance is not the only cause for inducing pulmonary damage in these diseases. Furthermore, a comparison of disease characteristics for PCD and CF should distinguish between CF-PI and CF-PS as different entities.

"	"We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused when defects of motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, male infertility, and situs abnormalities. Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia function remain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an in vivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.

Moreover, the identification of this novel mutation in DNAH5 indirectly indicates that exome capture and sequencing are beneficial in the genetic research of midget consanguinity families.

24226769	"The heterotaxy gene GALNT11 glycosylates Notch to orchestrate cilia type and laterality
"	"Heterotaxy is a disorder of left-right body patterning, or laterality, that is associated with major congenital heart disease. The aetiology and mechanisms underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals. The mechanism that specifies these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a patient with heterotaxy, and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11 activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1 signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch, establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for human heterotaxy.

24236100	"Reduced nasal nitric oxide production in cystic fibrosis patients with elevated systemic inflammation markers
"	"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced within the respiratory tract and can be detected in exhaled bronchial and nasal air. The concentration varies in specific diseases, being elevated in patients with asthma and bronchiectasis, but decreased in primary ciliary dyskinesia. In cystic fibrosis (CF), conflicting data exist on NO levels, which are reported unexplained as either decreased or normal. Functionally, NO production in the paranasal sinuses is considered as a location-specific first-line defence mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between upper and lower airway NO levels and blood inflammatory parameters, CF-pathogen colonisation, and clinical data. Nasal and bronchial NO concentrations from 57 CF patients were determined using an electrochemical analyser and correlated to pathogen colonisation of the upper and lower airways which were microbiologically assessed from nasal lavage and sputum samples. Statistical analyses were performed with respect to clinical parameters (lung function, BMI), laboratory findings (CRP, leucocytes, total-IgG, fibrinogen), and anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy. There were significant correlations between nasal and bronchial NO levels (rho = 0.48, p<0.001), but no correlation between NO levels and specific pathogen colonisation. In patients receiving azithromycin, significantly reduced bronchial NO and a tendency to reduced nasal NO could be found. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation of nasal NO to CRP (rho = -0.28, p = 0.04) and to leucocytes (rho = -0.41, p = 0.003) was observed. In contrast, bronchial NO levels showed no correlation to clinical or inflammatory parameters. Given that NO in the paranasal sinuses is part of the first-line defence mechanism against pathogens, our finding of reduced nasal NO in CF patients with elevated systemic inflammatory markers indicates impaired upper airway defence. This may facilitate further pathogen acquisition in the sinonasal area, with consequences for lung colonisation and the overall outcome in CF.

Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.

Demographic data and concomitant diagnoses of AR, cystic fibrosis, immunologic disorders and primary ciliary dyskinesia were analyzed for relationships with CRS. A total of 4044 children with an average age of 8.9 years and a slight male predominance (53.8%) with CRS were identified. Of these children, 0.2% had primary ciliary dyskinesia, 4.1% had cystic fibrosis, 12.3% had an immunologic disorder, and 26.9% had AR.

AR is more prevalent than the other comorbidities combined in children with CRS, and is independently associated with the presence of asthma. Formal allergy testing, guided by clinical history and regional allergen sensitivity prevalence, should be strongly considered in all children with CRS, in particular those with reactive airway disease.

Biallelic mutations in DNAH11 have been described as one cause of PCD with NU.The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD, in relation to the ultrastructural defect. Additionally, we aimed to demonstrate the need for biopsy and cell culture to reliably diagnose PCD, especially the NU subtype. We retrospectively analyzed data from 206 patients with PCD. We compared the clinical characteristics, lung function, microbiology and imaging results of 68 patients with PCD and NU to those of 90 patients with dynein deficiencies and 41 patients with central pair abnormalities. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the robustness of the diagnosis of the NU subtype in cell culture by data from genetic analysis. PCD with NU comprised 33% (68/206) of all patients with PCD. Compared to other subtypes, patients with PCD and NU had a similar frequency of upper and lower respiratory tract problems, as well as similar lung function and imaging. With the currently widely applied approach, without cell culture, the diagnosis would have been missed in 16% (11/68) of patients with NU. Genetic analysis was performed in 29/68 patients with PCD and NU, and biallelic mutations were found in 79% (23/29) of tested patients. We reported on the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD and NU. We have shown that systematic performance of biopsy and cell culture increases sensitivity to detect PCD, especially the subtype with NU.PCD with NU has similar clinical characteristics as other PCD types and requires biopsy plus ciliogenesis in culture for optimal diagnostic yield.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogenous autosomal recessive disease in which mutations disrupt ciliary function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and life-long lung disease. Mouse tracheal cells with a targeted deletion in the axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 (Dnaic1) gene differentiate normally in culture but lack ciliary activity. Gene transfer to undifferentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with avian influenza hemagglutinin restored Dnaic1 expression and ciliary activity. Importantly, apical treatment of well-differentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with lentiviral vector also restored ciliary activity, demonstrating successful gene transfer from the apical surface. Treatment of Dnaic1(flox/flox) mice expressing an estrogen-responsive Cre recombinase with different doses of tamoxifen indicated that restoration of ∼20% of ciliary activity may be sufficient to prevent the development of rhinosinusitis. However, although administration of a β-galactosidase-expressing vector into control mice demonstrated efficient gene transfer to the nasal epithelium, treatment of Dnaic1(-/-) mice resulted in a low level of gene transfer, demonstrating that the severe rhinitis present in these animals impedes gene transfer. The results demonstrate that gene replacement therapy may be a viable treatment option for PCD, but further improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer are necessary.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) leads to recurrent/chronic respiratory infections, resulting in chronic inflammation and potentially in chronic pulmonary disease with bronchiectasis. We analyzed longitudinal data on body length/height and body mass index (BMI) for 29 children and young adults with PCD aging 1.5-24 years (median, 14.5) who had been diagnosed at the age of 0.5-17 years (median, 8). Of these, 10 carried pathogenic mutations in either DNAH5 or DNAI1. In children with PCD, body length/height progressively decreased from +0.40 ± 0.24 SDS (the 1st birthday), +0.16 ± 0.23 SDS (3 years old), and -0.13 ± 0.21 SDS (5 years old) to -0.54 ± 0.19 SDS (7 years old; P = 0.01 versus 0), -0.67 ± 0.21 SDS (9 years old; P = 0.005 versus 0), -0.52 ± 0.24 SDS (11 years old; P = 0.04 versus 0), and -0.53 ± 0.23 SDS (13 years old; P = 0.03 versus 0). These results reflect low growth rates during the childhood growth period. Thereafter, heights stabilized up to the age of 17 years. The growth deterioration was not dependent on sex or disease severity but was more pronounced in DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutation carriers. BMI did not differ from population standards, which suggests that nutritional deficits are not the cause of growth delay. We conclude that PCD leads to chronic deprivation with significant growth deterioration during childhood.

24498942	"The role of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of motile cilia. The diagnosis of PCD has previously relied on ciliary analysis with transmission electron microscopy or video microscopy. However, patients with PCD may have normal ultrastructural appearance, and ciliary analysis has limited accessibility. Alternatively, PCD can be diagnosed by demonstrating biallelic mutations in known PCD genes. Genetic testing is emerging as a diagnostic tool to complement ciliary analysis where interpretation and access may delay diagnosis. To determine the diagnostic yield of genetic testing of patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of PCD in a multiethnic urban center. Twenty-eight individuals with confirmed PCD on transmission electron microscopy of ciliary ultrastructure and 24 individuals with a probable diagnosis of PCD based on a classical PCD phenotype and low nasal nitric oxide had molecular analysis of 12 genes associated with PCD. Of 49 subjects who underwent ciliary biopsy, 28 (57%) were diagnosed with PCD through an ultrastructural defect. Of the 52 individuals who underwent molecular genetic analysis, 22 (42%) individuals had two mutations in known PCD genes. Twenty-four previously unreported mutations in known PCD genes were observed. Combining both diagnostic modalities of biopsy and molecular genetics, the diagnostic yield increased to 69% compared with 57% based on biopsy alone. The diagnosis of PCD is challenging and has traditionally relied on ciliary biopsy, which is unreliable as the sole criterion for a definitive diagnosis. Molecular genetic analysis can be used as a complementary test to increase the diagnostic yield.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis and male infertility. The pulmonary phenotype in PCD is caused by the impaired motility of cilia in the respiratory epithelium, due to ultrastructural defects of these organelles. We hypothesized that defects of multi-protein ciliary complexes should be reflected by gene expression changes in the respiratory epithelium. We have previously found that large group of genes functionally related to cilia share highly correlated expression pattern in PCD bronchial tissue. Here we performed an explorative analysis of differential gene expression in the bronchial tissue from six PCD patients and nine non-PCD controls, using Illumina HumanRef-12 Whole Genome BeadChips. We observed 1323 genes with at least 2-fold difference in the mean expression level between the two groups (t-test p-value <0.05). Annotation analysis showed that the genes down-regulated in PCD biopsies (602) were significantly enriched for terms related to cilia, whereas the up-regulated genes (721) were significantly enriched for terms related to cell cycle and mitosis. We assembled a list of human genes predicted to encode ciliary proteins, components of outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, radial spokes, and intraflagellar transport proteins. A significant down-regulation of the expression of genes from all the four groups was observed in PCD, compared to non-PCD biopsies. Our data suggest that a coordinated down-regulation of the ciliome genes plays an important role in the molecular pathomechanism of PCD.

Situs inversus totalis occurs in ~50 % of PCD patients and it is known as Kartagener syndome. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and peritonitis, pleuritis, arthritis, or erysipelas-like skin disease. FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene which is located on chromosome 16p13.3. p.M680I, p.M694 V, p.M694I, p.V726A on exon 10 and p.E148Q on exon 2 are the most common mutations among FMF patients and these constitute 85 % of all. Homozygosity of R202Q polymorphism is strongly associated with FMF. We would like to present a case of Kartagener syndrome accompanied by FMF with R202Q polymorphism. Our case is the first in the literature indicating the accidental coexistence of FMF and Kartagener syndrome.

"	"Cilia play major functions in physiology and development, and ciliary dysfunctions are responsible for several diseases in humans called ciliopathies. Cilia motility is required for cell and fluid propulsion in organisms. In humans, cilia motility deficiencies lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, with upper-airways recurrent infections, left-right asymmetry perturbations, and fertility defects. In Drosophila, we identified hemingway (hmw) as a novel component required for motile cilia function. hmw encodes a 604-amino acid protein characterized by a highly conserved coiled-coil domain also found in the human orthologue, KIAA1430. We show that HMW is conserved in species with motile cilia and that, in Drosophila, hmw is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and spermatozoa. We created hmw-knockout flies and found that they are hearing impaired and male sterile. hmw is implicated in the motility of ciliated auditory sensory neurons and, in the testis, is required for elongation and maintenance of sperm flagella. Because HMW is absent from mature flagella, we propose that HMW is not a structural component of the motile axoneme but is required for proper acquisition of motile properties. This identifies HMW as a novel, evolutionarily conserved component necessary for motile cilium function and flagella assembly.

All 10 patients had recurrent chronic sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis/bronchiectasis since childhood. Nine cases with translocation of heart and big vessels were diagnosed as Kartagener syndrome. One woman was suffering from barrenness and one man sterility after marriage for long time without birth control. Nasal NO levels were significantly lower in 2 patients with PCD but it was almost normal in one patient. Ciliary ultrastructure investigated by transmission electron microscope were almost normal in 4 cases without missing of inner or outer dynein arms. Two cases taking exome capture sequencing showed that mutations happened in DNAH5 and DNAH11. Five subjects underwenting sanger sequencing on 6 common exon fragments of DNAH5 and DNAH11 did not show any abnormality. Ten cases took medication therapy, while 5 patients once underwent functional endoscope sinus surgery. All of the 10 patients had improvement of their symptoms and signs after treatment.

"	"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in innate immunity and has been reported to be associated with the age-related decline in lung function in cystic fibrosis. MBL polymorphisms are associated with lung function decline in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). We performed sputum microbiology, spirometry pre- and post-administration of salbutamol, ciliary motion analysis, ultrastructural assessment of cilia, ciliogenesis in culture, and chest high resolution computed tomography in children with a clinical history of respiratory tract infections and/or presence of bronchiectasis suggestive of PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). All subjects were evaluated for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding MBL-2. The diagnosis of PCD was established in 45 subjects, while in the remaining 53 the diagnosis was SCD. A significant bronchodilator response was observed only in PCD associated with the MBL2-3 genotype, which is known to be associated with low/undetectable MBL serum levels. Also, bronchiectasis severity was significantly greater in subjects with MBL2-3 in both PCD and SCD. No other association was found between MBL genotypes and clinical findings. MBL plays a relatively minor role as a disease modifier in PCD. A similar finding in SCD supports the likely significance of this result.

To describe the clinical findings and the molecular changes of affected dogs and estimate the worldwide prevalence of the mutation in a large cohort of OES. 578 OES, including 28 affected and 550 clinically healthy dogs. This retrospective study reviewed the data of OES diagnosed with PCD and OES tested for the mutation. Clinical data including results of physical examination and further investigations were obtained on 11/28 dogs. CCDC39 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis in affected dogs and healthy dogs. DNA was extracted on 561/578 dogs and a genetic test by Taqman technology was developed to genotype the CCDC39 mutation in these dogs. Clinical findings were recurrent nasal discharge and cough, pyrexia, leucocytosis, and bronchopneumonia. Ultrastructural defects were characterized by central microtubular abnormalities and decreased number of inner dynein arms (IDAs). Molecular analysis revealed a reduced expression of CCDC39 RNA and an absence of CCDC39 protein in affected dogs compared to healthy dogs. The mutation was more frequent in nonrandomly selected European OES population with a higher proportion of carriers (19%) compared to non-European dogs (7%). CCDC39 mutation is dispersed in a worldwide population and is responsible for PCD in this breed. Genetic testing might enable control of this disease.

"	"We present a study of five children from three unrelated Irish Traveller families presenting with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). As previously characterized disorders in the Irish Traveller population are caused by common homozygous mutations, we hypothesised that all three PCD families shared the same recessive mutation. However, exome sequencing showed that there was no pathogenic homozygous mutation common to all families. This finding was supported by histology, which showed that each family has a different type of ciliary defect; transposition defect (family A), nude epithelium (family B) and absence of inner and outer dynein arms (family C). Therefore, each family was analysed independently using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The affected siblings in family A share a novel 1 bp duplication in RSPH4A (NM\_001161664.1:c.166dup; p.Arg56Profs_11), a radial-spoke head protein involved in ciliary movement. In family B, we identified three candidate genes (CCNO, KCNN3 and CDKN1C), with a 5-bp duplication in CCNO (NM021147.3:c.258262dup; p.Gln88Argfs_8) being the most likely cause of ciliary aplasia. This is the first study to implicate CCNO, a DNA repair gene reported to be involved in multiciliogenesis, in PCD. In family C, we identified a ∼3.5-kb deletion in DYX1C1, a neuronal migration gene previously associated with PCD. This is the first report of a disorder in the relatively small Irish Traveller population to be caused by >1 disease gene. Our study identified at least three different PCD genes in the Irish Traveller population, highlighting that one cannot always assume genetic homogeneity, even in small consanguineous populations.

Here we report recessive loss-of-function and missense mutations in MCIDAS-encoding Multicilin, which was shown to promote the early steps of multiciliated cell differentiation in Xenopus. MCIDAS mutant respiratory epithelial cells carry only one or two cilia per cell, which lack ciliary motility-related proteins (DNAH5; CCDC39) as seen in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Consistent with this finding, FOXJ1-regulating axonemal motor protein expression is absent in respiratory cells of MCIDAS mutant individuals. CCNO, when mutated known to cause RGMC, is also absent in MCIDAS mutant respiratory cells, consistent with its downstream activity. Thus, our findings identify Multicilin as a key regulator of CCNO/FOXJ1 for human multiciliated cell differentiation, and highlight the 5q11 region containing CCNO and MCIDAS as a locus underlying RGMC.

"	"Cilia are microtubule-based hair-like organelles that play many important roles in development and physiology, and are implicated in a rapidly expanding spectrum of human diseases, collectively termed ciliopathies. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), one of the most prevalent of ciliopathies, arises from abnormalities in the differentiation or motility of the motile cilia. Despite their biomedical importance, a methodical functional screen for ciliary genes has not been carried out in any vertebrate at the organismal level. We sought to systematically discover novel motile cilia genes by identifying the genes induced by Foxj1, a winged-helix transcription factor that has an evolutionarily conserved role as the master regulator of motile cilia biogenesis. Unexpectedly, we find that the majority of the Foxj1-induced genes have not been associated with cilia before. To characterize these novel putative ciliary genes, we subjected 50 randomly selected candidates to a systematic functional phenotypic screen in zebrafish embryos. Remarkably, we find that over 60% are required for ciliary differentiation or function, whereas 30% of the proteins encoded by these genes localize to motile cilia. We also show that these genes regulate the proper differentiation and beating of motile cilia. This collection of Foxj1-induced genes will be invaluable for furthering our understanding of ciliary biology, and in the identification of new mutations underlying ciliary disorders in humans.

Different ways to measure nasal nitric oxide levels in children are currently available. The possibility of obtaining nasal nitric oxide measurement from relatively young children, combined with the availability of portable devices that can be used even in the office setting, opens new perspectives for nasal nitric oxide analysis in the pediatric daily practice. This review presents a synopsis about the current clinical applications of nasal nitric oxide measurement in the pediatric clinical practice. A total of 3,775 articles on the topic were identified, of which 883 duplicates were removed, and 2,803 were excluded based on review of titles and abstracts. Eighty-nine full text articles were assessed for eligibility and 32 additional articles were obtained from the reference lists of the retrieved studies. Since very low nasal nitric oxide levels are found in the majority of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, most publications support a central role for nasal nitric oxide to screen the disease, and indicate that it is a very helpful first-line tool in the real-life work-up in all age groups. Decreased nasal nitric oxide concentration is also typical of cystic fibrosis, even though nasal nitric oxide is not as low as in primary ciliary dyskinesia. In other upper airway disorders such as allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, and adenoidal hypertrophy, clinical utility of nasal nitric oxide is still critically questioned and remains to be established. Since nNO determination is flow dependent, a general consensus from the major investigators in this area is highly desirable so that future studies will be performed with the same flow rate. A shared nNO methodology will enable to overcome the challenges that lie ahead in incorporating nNO measurement into the mainstream clinical setting of pediatric airway diseases.

Investigations in zebrafish show that ciliation is important for the development of the otolith organs, but this has never been evaluated in humans. PCD is a congenital defect of ciliary structure. We undertook a pilot study to determine whether patients with PCD have absent or reduced otoconial function compared to the normal population. Vestibular function testing, including utricular centrifugation (UCF) testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and electronystagmography, was undertaken in five patients with known PCD. Patients also completed validated questionnaires regarding subjective balance function and symptoms. There were markedly reduced or unobtainable VEMPs bilaterally in three of the five subjects and unilaterally in the remaining two subjects. No subject had a pathological UCF asymmetry, but three subjects showed utricular abnormalities. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) at 0.25 Hz sinusoidal rotation was normal in all subjects. There were no subjective dizzy symptoms or balance issues. We speculate that the reduced saccular and utricular function in PCD patients observed in this pilot study suggests a relationship between cilia structure and/or motility, and otoconia seeding and/or positioning.

In humans, defects specifically affecting motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, infertility and laterality defects in the genetically heterogeneous disorder Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Using the comparatively simple Drosophila system, in which mechanosensory neurons possess modified motile cilia, we employed a recently elucidated cilia transcriptional RFX-FOX code to identify novel PCD candidate genes. Here, we report characterization of CG31320/HEATR2, which plays a conserved critical role in forming the axonemal dynein arms required for ciliary motility in both flies and humans. Inner and outer arm dyneins are absent from axonemes of CG31320 mutant flies and from PCD individuals with a novel splice-acceptor HEATR2 mutation. Functional conservation of closely arranged RFX-FOX binding sites upstream of HEATR2 orthologues may drive higher cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during early motile ciliogenesis. Immunoprecipitation reveals HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2, but not HSP70 or HSP90, distinguishing it from the client/chaperone functions described for other cytoplasmic proteins required for dynein arm assembly such as DNAAF1-4. These data implicate CG31320/HEATR2 in a growing intracellular pre-assembly and transport network that is necessary to deliver functional dynein machinery to the ciliary compartment for integration into the motile axoneme.

"	"Patients with congenital heart disease with heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal airway ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide, characteristics associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a reflection of the role of motile cilia in airway clearance and left-right patterning. To assess the potential broader clinical significance of airway ciliary dysfunction in congenital heart disease, we assessed the prevalence of ciliary dysfunction versus respiratory symptoms in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease were recruited (n = 218), 39 with heterotaxy. Nasal nitric oxide measurements and nasal biopsies for ciliary motion video microscopy were conducted. Sinopulmonary symptoms were reviewed by questionnaire. A high prevalence of ciliary motion defects (51.8%) and low or borderline low nasal nitric oxide levels (35.5%) were observed in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with ciliary motion defects or low nasal nitric oxide showed increased sinopulmonary symptoms, with most respiratory symptoms seen in those with both abnormal ciliary motion and low nitric oxide. Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide were more important in determining risk of sinopulmonary symptoms than heterotaxy status. Patients with congenital heart disease without heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide. This was associated with more sinopulmonary symptoms. These findings suggest that patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease and respiratory symptoms may benefit from screening for ciliary dysfunction and implementation of medical interventions to reduce sinopulmonary morbidities.

"	"Cilia line the surface of the respiratory tract and beat in a coordinated wave to protect the lungs against infection. Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare condition attributed to cilia dysfunction. Murine models of BBS suggest a respiratory phenotype; however, no reports have studied the translation of these findings in patients. We assessed the clinical symptoms of motile cilia dysfunction and the histology of ciliated respiratory epithelium in patients with BBS. We report an increased prevalence of neonatal respiratory distress at birth (12%), general practitioner-diagnosed asthma (21%), otitis media (33%), and rhinitis (36%) in patients with BBS. These symptoms, however, occurred at a significantly reduced prevalence compared with patients with known motile cilia dysfunction (primary ciliary dyskinesia). Respiratory epithelial assessment revealed cellular damage, significant ciliary depletion (on 60% of ciliated cells), and goblet cell hyperplasia in patients with BBS (50% goblet cells). These findings were quantifiably similar to those of patients with asthma (P > .05). Surprisingly, motile cilia function and ultrastructure were grossly normal with the exception of occasional unique inclusions within the ciliary membrane. In conclusion, motile ciliary structure and function are essentially normal in patients with BBS.

25386990	"Cilia dysfunction in lung disease
"	"A characteristic feature of the human airway epithelium is the presence of ciliated cells bearing motile cilia, specialized cell surface projections containing axonemes composed of microtubules and dynein arms, which provide ATP-driven motility. In the airways, cilia function in concert with airway mucus to mediate the critical function of mucociliary clearance, cleansing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. The prototypical disorder of respiratory cilia is primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder that leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, to repeated chest infections, and to the progressive destruction of lung architecture. Numerous acquired lung diseases are also marked by abnormalities in both cilia structure and function. In this review we summarize current knowledge regarding airway ciliated cells and cilia, how they function to maintain a healthy epithelium, and how disorders of cilia structure and function contribute to inherited and acquired lung disease.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease affecting motile cilia lining the respiratory tract. Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).

"	"The laterality in the embryo is determined by left-right asymmetric gene expression driven by the flow of extraembryonic fluid, which is maintained by the rotary movement of monocilia on the nodal cells. Defects manifest by abnormal formation and arrangement of visceral organs. The genetic etiology of defects not associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the cause of situs anomalies, including heterotaxy syndrome and situs inversus totalis, in a consanguineous family. Whole-exome analysis revealed a homozygous deleterious deletion in the WDR16 gene, which segregated with the phenotype. WDR16 protein was previously proposed to play a role in cilia-related signal transduction processes; the rat Wdr16 protein was shown to be confined to cilia-possessing tissues and severe hydrocephalus was observed in the wdr16 gene knockdown zebrafish. The phenotype associated with the homozygous deletion in our patients suggests a role for WDR16 in human laterality patterning. Exome analysis is a valuable tool for molecular investigation even in cases of large deletions.

Despite their importance, the native structure of human cilia is unknown, and structural defects in the cilia of patients are often undetectable or remain elusive because of heterogeneity. Here we develop an approach that enables visualization of human (patient) cilia at high-resolution using cryo-electron tomography of samples obtained noninvasively by nasal scrape biopsy. We present the native 3D structures of normal and PCD-causing RSPH1-mutant human respiratory cilia in unprecedented detail; this allows comparisons of cilia structure across evolutionarily distant species and reveals the previously unknown primary defect and the heterogeneous secondary defects in RSPH1-mutant cilia. Our data provide evidence for structural and functional heterogeneity in radial spokes, suggest a mechanism for the milder RSPH1 PCD phenotype and demonstrate that cryo-electron tomography can be applied to human disease by directly imaging patient samples.

To investigate technical and practical issues related to TB-nNO methods in children referred for suspected or asserted PCD, we recorded, in a prospective multicenter study, TB-nNO (calculated as the mean of 5 peaks, 10 or 30 sec during tidal breathing) and VC-nNO when available. We studied 142 children (PCD diagnosis asserted in 47, excluded in 39). Nasal NO values were significantly different according to methods, VC-nNO being higher than TB-nNO (TB-nNO 5 peaks higher than mean of 10 or 30 sec). Specificity (90-94%) and sensitivity (86-97%) were similar between TB-nNO and VC-nNO methods. Age was more correlated with VC-nNO than with TB-nNO. TB-nNO could differ between the two nostrils by more than 10% (or 10 ppb when nNO absolute value lower 100 ppb) in 32-43% of the tested children, according to the different tidal breathing values, and was reproducible in the long term but influenced by ambient NO. Despite TB-nNO values being lower than VC-nNO, TB-nNO was found to be as discriminant for PCD, and probably more discriminant in children less than 8 years old, as the VC method. These results were obtained using the chemiluminescence technique which allows an easier assessment of relevant factors such as nasal permeability and ambient NO than the electrochemical technique.

This study aims to provide clinical strategies on diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Clinical data of seven patients diagnosed as PCD in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were analyzed. We also extracted data from other cases in mainland China from the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database by the end of 2012. A total of 127 cases of PCD were summarized and analyzed in this study. Seven patients in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were finally confirmed to have PCD. All of them had clinical history of recurrent respiratory infection. Imaging analysis showed varying degrees of bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests in four patients showed combined obstructive and restrictive patterns. Three cases were confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy. We then further extracted information from literature for those 127 PCD patients in mainland China. All of them had chronic respiratory infection. Seven cases were complicated with recurrent otitis media and 15 cases were complicated with infertility. A total of 119 patients were diagnosed with situs inversus totalis (94%). Among those 127 patients, only 9 patients' diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy. Four patients received sinus resection, and one patient received pulmonary lobectomy due to recurrent hemoptysis. One patient died of massive hemoptysis. Being a rare disease and easily confused with uncomplicated bronchiectasis, PCD diagnosis warrants particular attention. Recurrent respiratory infection, especially situs inversus could be the most important indicator of this disease.

In PCD, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), sputum microbiology, self-reported physical activity (PA) level, and quality of life (QoL) by means of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), were also assessed. Seventy-two percent of PCD patients were vitamin-D deficient-to-insufficient and 28% were sufficient. No differences in PFTs parameters were found between vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups. Patients with vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency had significantly higher SGRQ total scores, and thus poorer QoL (p = 0.03). Seventy-nine percent of PCD subjects had limitations in performing vigorous activities, and 53% performed less than 3 hours of PA per week. Vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups did not show any differences in age at PCD diagnosis or at onset of respiratory symptoms, BMI, atopy, current asthma or bronchiectasis. However, 79% of patients with bronchiectasis had vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency. No differences were found in the rate of positive sputum cultures and in the number of antibiotic courses between the two groups. Hypovitaminosis D is common in PCD patients, and is associated with poorer QoL. We recommend the assessment and treatment of hypovitaminosis D to be included in the routine management of PCD.

This mucociliary defense mechanism is essential for pulmonary health, because respiratory ciliary motion defects, such as those in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or congenital heart disease, can cause severe sinopulmonary disease necessitating organ transplant. The visual examination of nasal or bronchial biopsies is critical for the diagnosis of ciliary motion defects, but these analyses are highly subjective and error-prone. Although ciliary beat frequency can be computed, this metric cannot sensitively characterize ciliary motion defects. Furthermore, PCD can present without any ultrastructural defects, limiting the use of other detection methods, such as electron microscopy. Therefore, an unbiased, computational method for analyzing ciliary motion is clinically compelling. We present a computational pipeline using algorithms from computer vision and machine learning to decompose ciliary motion into quantitative elemental components. Using this framework, we constructed digital signatures for ciliary motion recognition and quantified specific properties of the ciliary motion that allowed high-throughput classification of ciliary motion as normal or abnormal. We achieved >90% classification accuracy in two independent data cohorts composed of patients with congenital heart disease, PCD, or heterotaxy, as well as healthy controls.

Secondly, parents with a sick child (e.g. PCD, PBB) answered the questionnaire and a data base was set up. Finally, a computer program consisting of eight different classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy rule-based, random forest, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and nearest neighbour) and an ensemble classifier was developed and trained to categorise any given new questionnaire and suggest a diagnosis. For estimating the diagnostic accuracy, we applied ten-fold stratified cross validation. All questionnaires of patients suffering from CF, asthma (AS), PCD, acute bronchitis (AB) and the healthy control group were correctly diagnosed by the fusion algorithm. For the pneumonia (PM) group 19/21 (90.5%) and for the PBB group 17/18 (94.4%) correct diagnoses could be reached. The program detected the correct diagnoses with an overall sensitivity of 98.8%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses confirmed the accuracy of this diagnostic tool. Case studies highlighted the applicability of the tool in the daily work of a GP.

"	"In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), impaired mucociliary clearance leads to an accumulation of secretions in the airways and susceptibility to repeated bacterial infections. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial flora in non-chronic and chronic infections in the lower airways of patients with PCD. We retrospectively reviewed the presence of bacteria from patients with PCD during an 11-year period and genotyped 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from 12 patients with chronic infection using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We identified 5450 evaluable cultures from 107 patients with PCD (median age 17 years, range 0-74 years) (median age at diagnosis 7.8 years, range 0-63 years). Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent microorganism. Other common pathogens were P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The number of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa at least once varied from 11 to 44 patients (15-47%) annually, and 42 patients (39%) met the criteria for chronic infection at least once. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated in teenagers and adults than children (p 0.02) and the prevalence was significantly lower in patients with preschool (<6 years) PCD diagnosis (p 0.04). Ten out of 12 patients (83%) were chronically infected with a unique clone-type of P. aeruginosa. No sharing of clone-types or patient-to-patient transmission was observed. In conclusion, PCD patients were infected by a unique set of bacteria acquired in an age-dependent sequence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently colonizes the lower respiratory tract and the incidence of chronic infection was higher than previously reported.

26373788	"Ciliary function and motor protein composition of human fallopian tubes
"	"What is the motor protein composition and function of human fallopian tube (FT) cilia? Although the motor protein composition and function of human FT cilia resemble that of respiratory cilia, females with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are not necessarily infertile. FTs are lined with multiple motile cilia, which show a 9 + 2 ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. Case reports suggest an increased incidence of subfertility and ectopic pregnancy in women with PCD, a disease characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. This study consisted of an observational laboratory study on human FT specimens from five healthy females recruited from April 2012 to December 2013 and a descriptive observational retrospective analysis of a clinical PCD database. Human FT tissue was obtained from five healthy females after tubal ligation during caesarean delivery. Motor protein composition was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against dynein arms and nexin-dynein regulatory complex subunits. Ciliary motility was analysed by high-speed video microscopy. A retrospective search of our database of PCD individuals was performed for information on conception and childbirth. The motor protein composition of human FT cilia was identical to that of respiratory cilia. FT cilia showed coordinated beating, resulting in a directed fluid flow towards the uterine cavity. We identified nine PCD individuals with severe dysfunction of respiratory cilia who gave birth to children after spontaneous conception. This suggests that ciliary beating is not the key motor of ovum transport. FT cilia of affected PCD females were not available for analysis. Thus, it remains to be proven that FT cilia indeed show the same defects as respiratory cilia in PCD individuals. Comprehensive epidemiological studies are needed to determine the extent of female (sub-) fertility in PCD. Knowledge of the exact protein composition and function of FT cilia will contribute to a better understanding of cilia-generated fluid flow in female reproduction. These findings are important for subsequent studies of function and protein composition of FT cilia in PCD patients.

"	"Multiciliated epithelial cells protect the upper and lower airways from chronic bacterial infections by moving mucus and debris outward. Congenital disorders of ciliary beating, referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), are characterized by deficient mucociliary clearance and severe, recurrent respiratory infections. Numerous genetic defects, most of which can be detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are so far known to cause different abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. However, some defects are not regularly discernable by TEM because the ciliary architecture of the axoneme remains preserved. This applies in particular to isolated defects of the nexin links, also known as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), connecting the peripheral outer microtubular doublets. Immunofluorescence analyses of respiratory cells from PCD-affected individuals detected a N-DRC defect. Genome-wide exome sequence analyses identified recessive loss-of-function mutations in GAS8 encoding DRC4 in three independent PCD-affected families.

"	"Gene therapy holds promise to cure a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. Recent successes in recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-based gene therapy in the clinic for hereditary disorders such as Leber's congenital amaurosis and hemophilia B encouraged us to reexplore an rAAV approach for pulmonary gene transfer. Only limited clinical successes have been achieved for airway gene transfer so far, underscoring the need for further preclinical development of rAAV-based gene therapy for pulmonary disorders. We sought to determine the preclinical potential of an airway-tropic serotype, rAAV2/5, encoding reporter genes when delivered to mouse airways. Although several groups have assessed the stability of gene transfer using a nonintegrating rAAV in mouse airways, long-term stability for more than a year has not been reported. Additionally, an extensive quantitative analysis of the specific cell types targeted by rAAV2/5 using cell-specific markers is lacking. We obtained sustained gene expression in upper and lower airways up to 15 months after vector administration, a substantial proportion of the lifespan of a laboratory mouse. In addition, we demonstrated that readministration of rAAV2/5 to the airways is feasible and increases gene expression 14 months after primary vector administration, despite the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies. Finally, identification of transduced cell types revealed different subpopulations being targeted by rAAV2/5, with 64% of β-galactosidase-positive cells being ciliated cells, 34% club cells in the conducting airways, and 75% alveolar type II cells in the alveoli at 1 month postinjection. This underscores the therapeutic potential of a nonintegrating rAAV vector to develop a gene therapeutic drug for a variety of pulmonary disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and surfactant deficiencies.

26824761	"ZMYND10--Mutation Analysis in Slavic Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare recessive disease with a prevalence of 1/10,000; its symptoms are caused by a kinetic dysfunction of motile cilia in the respiratory epithelium, flagella in spermatozoids, and primary cilia in the embryonic node. PCD is genetically heterogeneous: genotyping the already known PCD-related genes explains the genetic basis in 60-65% of the cases, depending on the population. While identification of new genes involved in PCD pathogenesis remains crucial, the search for new, population-specific mutations causative for PCD is equally important. The Slavs remain far less characterized in this respect compared to West European populations, which significantly limits diagnostic capability. The main goal of this study was to characterize the profile of causative genetic defects in one of the PCD-causing genes, ZMYND10, in the cohort of PCD patients of Slavic origin. The study was carried out using biological material from 172 unrelated PCD individuals of Polish origin, with no causative mutation found in nine major PCD genes. While none of the previously described mutations was found using the HRM-based screening, a novel frameshift mutation (c.367delC) in ZMYND10, unique for Slavic PCD population, was found in homozygous state in two unrelated PCD patients. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms from the ciliary axoneme, consistent with the already published ZMYND10-mutated phenotype; cDNA analysis revealed the lack of ZMYND10 mRNA, indicating nonsense-mediated decay of the truncated transcript.

"	"Symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are nonspecific and guidance on whom to refer for testing is limited. Diagnostic tests for PCD are highly specialised, requiring expensive equipment and experienced PCD scientists. This study aims to develop a practical clinical diagnostic tool to identify patients requiring testing.Patients consecutively referred for testing were studied. Information readily obtained from patient history was correlated with diagnostic outcome. Using logistic regression, the predictive performance of the best model was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The model was simplified into a practical tool (PICADAR) and externally validated in a second diagnostic centre.Of 641 referrals with a definitive diagnostic outcome, 75 (12%) were positive. PICADAR applies to patients with persistent wet cough and has seven predictive parameters: full-term gestation, neonatal chest symptoms, neonatal intensive care admittance, chronic rhinitis, ear symptoms, situs inversus and congenital cardiac defect. Sensitivity and specificity of the tool were 0.90 and 0.75 for a cut-off score of 5 points. Area under the curve for the internally and externally validated tool was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively.PICADAR represents a simple diagnostic clinical prediction rule with good accuracy and validity, ready for testing in respiratory centres referring to PCD centres.

"	"Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving left-right patterning defects, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a sinopulmonary disease with dyskinetic/immotile cilia in the airway are seemingly disparate diseases. However, they have an overlapping genetic etiology involving mutations in cilia genes, a reflection of the common requirement for motile cilia in left-right patterning and airway clearance. While PCD is a monogenic recessive disorder, heterotaxy has a more complex, largely non-monogenic etiology. In this study, we show mutations in the novel dynein gene DNAH6 can cause heterotaxy and ciliary dysfunction similar to PCD. We provide the first evidence that trans-heterozygous interactions between DNAH6 and other PCD genes potentially can cause heterotaxy. DNAH6 was initially identified as a candidate heterotaxy/PCD gene by filtering exome-sequencing data from 25 heterotaxy patients stratified by whether they have airway motile cilia defects. dnah6 morpholino knockdown in zebrafish disrupted motile cilia in Kupffer's vesicle required for left-right patterning and caused heterotaxy with abnormal cardiac/gut looping. Similarly DNAH6 shRNA knockdown disrupted motile cilia in human and mouse respiratory epithelia. Notably a heterotaxy patient harboring heterozygous DNAH6 mutation was identified to also carry a rare heterozygous PCD-causing DNAI1 mutation, suggesting a DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interaction. Furthermore, sequencing of 149 additional heterotaxy patients showed 5 of 6 patients with heterozygous DNAH6 mutations also had heterozygous mutations in DNAH5 or other PCD genes. We functionally assayed for DNAH6/DNAH5 and DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interactions using subthreshold double-morpholino knockdown in zebrafish and showed this caused heterotaxy. Similarly, subthreshold siRNA knockdown of Dnah6 in heterozygous Dnah5 or Dnai1 mutant mouse respiratory epithelia disrupted motile cilia function. Together, these findings support an oligogenic disease model with broad relevance for further interrogating the genetic etiology of human ciliopathies.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous, recessive disorder of motile cilia, is associated with distinct clinical features. Diagnostic tests, including ultrastructural analysis of cilia, nasal nitric oxide measurements, and molecular testing for mutations in PCD genes, have inherent limitations. To define a statistically valid combination of systematically defined clinical features that strongly associates with PCD in children and adolescents. Investigators at seven North American sites in the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium prospectively and systematically assessed individuals (aged 0-18 yr) referred due to high suspicion for PCD. The investigators defined specific clinical questions for the clinical report form based on expert opinion. Diagnostic testing was performed using standardized protocols and included nasal nitric oxide measurement, ciliary biopsy for ultrastructural analysis of cilia, and molecular genetic testing for PCD-associated genes. Final diagnoses were assigned as ""definite PCD"" (hallmark ultrastructural defects and/or two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), ""probable/possible PCD"" (no ultrastructural defect or genetic diagnosis, but compatible clinical features and nasal nitric oxide level in PCD range), and ""other diagnosis or undefined."" Criteria were developed to define early childhood clinical features on the basis of responses to multiple specific queries. Each defined feature was tested by logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to define the most robust set of clinical features associated with PCD. From 534 participants 18 years of age and younger, 205 were identified as having ""definite PCD"" (including 164 with two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), 187 were categorized as ""other diagnosis or undefined,"" and 142 were defined as having ""probable/possible PCD."" Participants with ""definite PCD"" were compared with the ""other diagnosis or undefined"" group. Four criteria-defined clinical features were statistically predictive of PCD: laterality defect; unexplained neonatal respiratory distress; early-onset, year-round nasal congestion; and early-onset, year-round wet cough (adjusted odds ratios of 7.7, 6.6, 3.4, and 3.1, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity based on the number of criteria-defined clinical features were four features, 0.21 and 0.99, respectively; three features, 0.50 and 0.96, respectively; and two features, 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Systematically defined early clinical features could help identify children, including infants, likely to have PCD. Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00323167).

Older age at diagnosis was associated with impaired baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (r= -0.30, p=0.01) and increased Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation (difference in medians 17 years (95% CI 4.5-20 years); p=0.002).

Lung function decline was associated with ciliary ultrastructure, with microtubular defect patients having the greatest decline (p=0.04). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores of severity of bronchial wall dilatation (p<0.001) and extent of bronchiectasis (p=0.03) additionally showed evidence of modifying FEV1 decline with age.Our study reveals that a large proportion of adult PCD patients are diagnosed late, with impaired FEV1 and increased P. aeruginosa colonisation. Increased disease burden on HRCT and ciliary ultrastructure may predict progressive lung function decline. This study characterises a large adult PCD population, identifies features associated with disease progression and highlights the need for prospective trials to determine whether early diagnosis of high-risk subgroups alongside optimal management can modify disease progression.

"	"Airway diseases, including cigarette smoke-induced chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary dyskinesia are associated with decreased mucociliary clearance (MCC). However, it is not known whether a simple reduction in MCC or concentration-dependent mucus adhesion to airway surfaces dominates disease pathogenesis or whether decreasing the concentration of secreted mucins may be therapeutic. To address these questions, Scnn1b-Tg mice, which exhibit airway mucus dehydration/adhesion, were compared and crossed with Muc5b- and Muc5ac-deficient mice. Absence of Muc5b caused a 90% reduction in MCC, whereas Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited an ∼50% reduction. However, the degree of MCC reduction did not correlate with bronchitic airway pathology, which was observed only in Scnn1b-Tg mice. Ablation of Muc5b significantly reduced the extent of mucus plugging in Scnn1b-Tg mice. However, complete absence of Muc5b in Scnn1b-Tg mice was associated with increased airway inflammation, suggesting that Muc5b is required to maintain immune homeostasis. Loss of Muc5ac had few phenotypic consequences in Scnn1b-Tg mice. These data suggest that: (i) mucus hyperconcentration dominates over MCC reduction alone to produce bronchitic airway pathology; (ii) Muc5b is the dominant contributor to the Scnn1b-Tg phenotype; and (iii) therapies that limit mucin secretion may reduce plugging, but complete Muc5b removal from airway surfaces may be detrimental.

"	"Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections, through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

A conceptual framework was generated by literature review, focus groups (expert clinicians and patients/parents), and open-ended interviews with children, adolescents, and parents of patients with PCD. We recruited participants from international research consortiums, PCD clinics, and patient advocacy groups, aiming for representation of a wide spectrum of disease severity, sociodemographic status, and ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained and experienced research assistants and psychologists. Transcripts were content-analyzed with Atlas.ti/NVivo to assess saturation of content. A self-completed item relevance survey was administered to E.U. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to construct draft instruments. Questionnaires were further refined after cognitive interviews. Focus groups (n = 62 experts; n = 20 patients/parents) and open-ended interviews with patients/parents (n = 69; 34 males; age at diagnosis, 0-15 yr; FEV1, 58-118% predicted) revealed a wide spectrum of issues unique to this population. Content analysis of transcripts identified the following domains, depending on age: Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Treatment Burden, Ears and Hearing, Sinus Symptoms, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, School Functioning, and Eating and Weight. Various items were retained in questionnaires, based on age and role of respondent: 37, 43, and 41 items for children, adolescents, and parent proxy, respectively. The item relevance survey (n = 57) yielded results similar to those of open-ended interviews. Cognitive testing (n = 47; 20 males; age at diagnosis, 0-11 yr; FEV1, 49-124% predicted) confirmed that items and response choices were clear and understood by respondents, and that all relevant items were included. The QOL-PCD measures, developed using rigorous, protocol-driven methods and international collaborations, have demonstrated content validity and cross-cultural equivalence for implementation in English-speaking populations. Psychometric testing is underway to determine their measurement properties for evaluating clinical interventions and informing quality of care.

"	"Translational readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) induced by pharmacological compounds has proven to be an effective way of restoring functional protein expression and reducing symptoms in several genetic disorders. We tested the potential of different concentrations of several aminoglycosides (AAGs) for promoting PTC-readthrough in 5 genes involved in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder caused by the dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. The efficiency of readthrough stimulation of PTCs cloned in dual reporter vectors was examined in 2 experimental settings: in vitro (transcription/translation system) and ex vivo (transiently transfected epithelial cell line). PTC-readthrough was observed in 5 of the 16 mutations analyzed. UGA codons were more susceptible to AAG-stimulated readthrough than UAG; no suppression of UAA was observed. The efficiency of PTC-readthrough in vitro (from less than 1% to ∼28% of the translation from the corresponding wild-type constructs) differed with the AAG type and concentration, and depended on the combination of AAG and PTC, indicating that each PTC has to be individually tested with a range of stimulating compounds. The maximal values of PTC suppression observed in the ex vivo experiments were, depending on AAG used, 3-5 times lower than the corresponding values in vitro, despite using AAG concentrations that were 2 orders of magnitude higher. This indicates that, while the in vitro system is sufficient to examine the readthrough-susceptibility of PTCs, it is not sufficient to test the compounds potential to stimulate PTC-readthrough in the living cells. Most of the tested compounds (except for G418) at their highest concentrations did not disturb ciliogenesis in the cultures of primary respiratory epithelial cells from healthy donors.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, mostly autosomal-recessive disorder of motile cilia, characterized by chronic lung disease, rhinosinusitis, hearing impairment, and subfertility. PCD is still often missed or diagnosed late since symptoms overlap with common respiratory complaints, but should be considered if one or more of the cardinal clues are present. Areas covered: We provide an overview on clinical presentations of PCD and clues for when to consider PCD, these include unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, persistent rhinitis from the first days of life, situs anomalies, or otorrhoea following tympanostomy tube insertion. Diagnosis is on the basis of clinical suspicion, and an algorithm of nasal nitric oxide, ciliary beat pattern and frequency, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence of ciliary proteins and genetic studies. However, there is no one gold-standard test as yet. We reviewed the current literature based on PubMed and Ovid databases literature search. Expert commentary: There is a need for increased awareness about PCD beyond specialist respiratory clinicians and a need for standardization of PCD diagnostics internationally. Early diagnosis means that inappropriate treatment based on misdiagnosed conditions can be avoided, and the onset of bronchiectasis may be delayed.

"	"Cilia are cell surface organelles with key roles in a range of cellular processes, including generation of fluid flow by motile cilia. The axonemes of motile cilia and immotile kinocilia contain 9 peripheral microtubule doublets, a central microtubule pair, and 9 connecting radial spokes. Aberrant radial spoke components RSPH1, 3, 4a and 9 have been linked with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by ciliary dysmotility; yet, radial spoke functions remain unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Rsph9 is expressed in cells bearing motile cilia and kinocilia, and localizes to both 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. Using CRISPR mutagenesis, we show that rsph9 is required for motility of presumptive 9 + 2 olfactory cilia and, unexpectedly, 9 + 0 neural cilia. rsph9 is also required for the structural integrity of 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. rsph9 mutant larvae exhibit reduced initiation of the acoustic startle response consistent with hearing impairment, suggesting a novel role for Rsph9 in the kinocilia of the inner ear and/or lateral line neuromasts. These data identify novel roles for Rsph9 in 9 + 0 motile cilia and in sensory kinocilia, and establish a useful zebrafish PCD model.

A national multicenter study from 2012 to 2013 recruited patients diagnosed or suspected of having PCD. Diagnosis was verified using: nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO); High-speed Video Microscope Analysis (HVMA); Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of cilia; Immuno-fluorescence staining (IF) for ciliary proteins, and genetic analysis. Of the 203 patients recruited from 14 pediatric centers, 150 had a PCD diagnosis verified. Median age was 15.05y, with range 0.15-60.5y. PCD prevalence was 1:54,000 for the general population and 1:25,000 in children (5-14 y). For the non-Jewish (mainly Druze and Arab Moslem) compared to Jewish populations, prevalence was 1:16,500 and 1:139,000 respectively (p < 0.0001) and parental consanguinity was 85.4% and 21.9% respectively (p < 0.0001). Clinical features included bronchiectasis (88%), rhinitis (81%), recurrent pneumonia (78%), recurrent otitis (62%), neonatal pneumonia (60%) and situs inversus (42%). Prior diagnostic practices varied widely between centers with TEM assessed in 55% and abnormal in 61% of these. Management included antibiotics and airway clearance. Diagnostic verification revealed for 150 PCD patients: 81% nNO<233 ppb, 62% abnormal HVMA, 51% diagnostic TEM, 58% diagnostic IF and, 57% genetic diagnosis. PCD in Israel is rare, with comprehensive diagnostic tests showing prevalence in children similar to Europe. Prevalence was higher in non-Jews, associated with parental consanguinity. Diagnostic and management practices vary. Referral centers providing comprehensive diagnostic and care capabilities should be established.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by structural and/or functional impairment of cilia throughout the whole body. Early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long‑term sequelae, however early diagnosis is a challenge due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD. In the current study, the patient with PCD was diagnosed at nine years old following several efforts to control intractable airway symptoms. The patient experienced a chronic productive cough beginning in early childhood and had multiple episodes of pneumonia and otitis media with effusion and sinusitis. No situs inversus or other heterotaxias were reported. Serial chest X‑rays exhibited persistent atelectasis and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe. When the patient was nine years old, electron microscopy of his cilia and genetic analysis were conducted. Electron microscopy of a biopsy specimen from the nasal mucosa indicated loss of the outer dynein arms. Whole‑exome analysis of the genome demonstrated the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5: NM_001369.2:c.5983C>T, p.Arg1995X in exon 36 and NM_001369.2:c.9101delG, p.Gly3034ValfsX22 in exon 54; neither of which have been previously reported in the literature in a Japanese patient. Notably, this case is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of PCD caused by the DNAH5 mutation in a Japanese patient.

The BRR is a database of patients with non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) enrolled at 13 sites in the United States. Baseline demographic, spirometric, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data were entered into a central Internet-based database. Patients were subsequently analyzed by the presence of NTM. We enrolled 1,826 patients between 2008 and 2014. Patients were predominantly women (79%), white (89%), and never smokers (60%), with a mean age of 64 ± 14 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients had a history of NTM disease or NTM isolated at baseline evaluation for entry into the BRR. Patients with NTM were older, predominantly women, and had bronchiectasis diagnosed at a later age than those without NTM. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was more common in those with NTM, whereas asthma, primary immunodeficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia were more common in those without NTM. Fifty-one percent of patients had spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction. Patients with NTM were more likely to have diffusely dilated airways and tree-in-bud abnormalities. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were cultured less commonly in patients with NTM. Bronchial hygiene measures were used more often in those with NTM, whereas antibiotics used for exacerbations, rotating oral antibiotics, steroid use, and inhaled bronchodilators were more commonly used in those without NTM. Adult patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the US BRR are described, with differences noted in demographic, radiographic, microbiological, and treatment variables based on stratification of the presence of NTM.

"	"Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of primary airway epithelial cells enables mucociliary differentiation providing an in vitro model of the human airway, but their proliferative potential is limited. To extend proliferation, these cells were previously transduced with viral oncogenes or mouse Bmi-1 + hTERT, but the resultant cell lines did not undergo mucociliary differentiation. We hypothesized that use of human BMI-1 alone would increase the proliferative potential of bronchial epithelial cells while retaining their mucociliary differentiation potential. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells were transduced by lentivirus with BMI-1 and then their morphology, replication kinetics, and karyotype were assessed. When differentiated at ALI, mucin production, ciliary function, and transepithelial electrophysiology were measured. Finally, shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells was used to model primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). BMI-1-transduced basal cells showed normal cell morphology, karyotype, and doubling times despite extensive passaging. The cell lines underwent mucociliary differentiation when cultured at ALI with abundant ciliation and production of the gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B evident. Cilia displayed a normal beat frequency and 9+2 ultrastructure. Electrophysiological characteristics of BMI-1-transduced cells were similar to those of untransduced cells. shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells produced immotile cilia and absence of DNAH5 in the ciliary axoneme as seen in cells from patients with PCD. BMI-1 delayed senescence in bronchial epithelial cells, increasing their proliferative potential but maintaining mucociliary differentiation at ALI. We have shown these cells are amenable to genetic manipulation and can be used to produce novel disease models for research and dissemination.

In this study, through two cases of KS, we aimed to assess the clinical and genetic characteristics of KS caused by DNAH5 mutations. The two cases of KS from the same family underwent extensive clinical assessments, with next-generation DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify pathogenic genes. In addition, Sanger sequencing was used to verify the pedigrees. The present study employed a directional capture strategy for hereditary disease screening, which correctly identified the virulence sites in the pedigree, and facilitated the differential diagnosis among multiple genes. Two novel mutations were detected in DNAH5: c.7778C>T (missense mutation) and c.13729G>A (nonsense mutation). They were not found in dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, and ExAC. These findings demonstrated that new DNAH5 mutations could be used for molecular diagnosis of KS, providing families with genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

"	"Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare, multi-system condition characterized by retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, obesity, insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hepatorenal disease, and recurrent respiratory infections. It belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as primary ciliopathies, which includes autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney diseases, as well as Joubert and Bardet-Biedl syndromes. Prior studies have suggested phenotypic overlap between primary ciliopathies affecting the non-motile, sensory cilia, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a motile ciliopathy characterized by respiratory tract disease. We describe the burden of oto-sino-pulmonary disease in 38 individuals with AS and examines the degree of clinical overlap between PCD and AS. Evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center included clinical examination, chest imaging, and clinical history surveys, as well as measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in nine patients. Recurrent otitis media was ubiquitous in the AS cohort (92%) with 50% requiring pressure equalization tube placement. A history of bronchitis/pneumonia and sinusitis was reported in 61% and 50% of individuals, respectively. PCD-characterizing symptoms (laterality defects, unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion, and wet cough) were far less prevalent in the AS cohort compared to PCD, and the average nNO production in the AS cohort was 232 ± 57.1 nl/min compared to a cut-off of <77 nl/min for PCD. These data suggest that the oto-sino-respiratory complications in AS are prominent enough to warrant increased clinical attention, but significantly impaired respiratory cilia function as seen in PCD is unlikely in AS.

Thirty-five participants repeated QOL-PCD 10-14 days later to measure stability or reproducibility of the measure. Multitrait analysis was used to evaluate how the items loaded on 10 hypothesised scales: physical, emotional, role and social functioning, treatment burden, vitality, health perceptions, upper respiratory symptoms, lower respiratory symptoms and ears and hearing symptoms. This analysis of item-to-total correlations led to 9 items being dropped; the validated measure now comprises 40 items. Each scale had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.74 to 0.94). Two-week test-retest demonstrated stability for all scales (intraclass coefficients 0.73 to 0.96). Significant correlations were obtained between QOL-PCD scores and age and FEV1. Strong relationships were also found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, lower respiratory symptoms and SGRQ-C (r=0.72, p<0.001), while weak correlations were found between measures of different constructs. QOL-PCD has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity. QOL-PCD offers a promising tool for evaluating new therapies and for measuring symptoms, functioning and QOL during routine care.

To evaluate whether they are important in the pathophysiology of primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, SCD). We measured sputum bacteriology, lung CT changes, MMPs, TIMPs and lung function in 86 patients (51 PCD, 35 SCD) in a cross-sectional study; the 10 controls studied did not have HRCT or sputum cultures. MMPs, TIMPs and lung function were evaluated longitudinally for up to one year in 38 PCD patients. At baseline, there were no differences in MMPs, TIMPs and MMPs/TIMPs, between PCD and SCD but lower levels were found in controls. There was an association between poorer lung function with increasing levels of MMPs in PCD, while in SCD only MMP-9/TIMP-1 values correlated with FRC z-scores. Levels of MMPs and TIMPs significantly correlated with severity HRCT changes. Longitudinally, there were significant correlations between slope of changes in spirometric parameters and slope of change in sputum MMPs in PCD patients. In conclusion, we report for the first time that increased MMPs are associated with worse airway damage in PCD and SCD, and thus are potential therapeutic targets.

The ENT objectivity was annotated, and then patients were subjected to audiometric test, tympanometry, registration of otoacoustic emission, and vestibular evaluation. Otitis media with chronic middle ear effusion (OME) during childhood was reported in 52% of the subjects, no patient had undergone ear surgery, and only 2 patients had an episode of otitis in the last year. Eleven of 23 patients showed normal hearing, 11 had a conductive hearing impairment, and 1 showed a severe sensorineural hearing loss unrelated to the syndrome. The bilateral stapedial reflex was only found in all cases of normoacusia and type A tympanogram, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were present in 8 patients, and no patient had vestibular alterations. Our study confirms a very frequent prevalence of OME in PCD during childhood. Careful monitoring of otological complications of the syndrome is always desirable, also given the high presence in adults of other manifestations in the upper airways, such as chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis.

Explanted cells and sheets of nasal epithelium form fully differentiated spheroids enclosing a partly fluid-filled lumen with the ciliated apical surface facing the outside and accessible for analysis of ciliary function. We performed a two-group comparison study of ciliary beat pattern and ciliary beat frequency in spheroids derived from nasal airway epithelium in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in healthy controls. Nasal ciliary cells and sheets were removed on day 1 by nasal brush biopsy and analyzed with regard to ciliary beat pattern-and frequency using high-speed video imaging for standard reference values. Three-dimensional explant spheroid formation was initiated in the same individual on the same day by incubation of cells and sheets from a separate brush biopsy. Harvested spheroids were analyzed earliest possible and values of spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were compared to the corresponding reference values from day 1. Spheroids formed fast in serum-free culture medium. Formation was successful in 15 out of 18 (82%) sampled individuals. Thus, formation was successful in seven healthy controls and eight PCD patients, while unsuccessful in 3 with PCD due to infection. Median (range) number of days in culture before harvesting of spheroids was 4 (1-5) in healthy versus 2 (1-5) in PCD. Spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were unchanged compared to their corresponding day 1 standard reference values. Spheroid ciliary beat frequency discriminated highly significant between healthy controls (9.3 Hz) and PCD patients (2.4 Hz) (P < 0.0001). Survival of spheroids was 16 days in a single healthy person. Patient-specific three-dimensional explant spheroid formation from a minimal invasive nasal brush biopsy is a feasible, fast and valid ex vivo method to assess ciliary function with potential of aiding the diagnosis of PCD. In addition, it may be a useful model in the investigation of pathophysiological aspects and drug effects in human nasal airway epithelium.

We assessed clinical, functional, microbiological and MRI findings in PCD and mild CF patients in order to evaluate different expression of lung disease. Twenty PCD (15.1 years) and 20 CF subjects with mild respiratory impairment (16 years, 70% with pancreatic insufficiency) underwent MRI, spirometry, and sputum cultures when clinically stable. MRI was scored using the modified Helbich system. PCD was diagnosed later than CF (9.9 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.03), despite earlier symptoms (0.1 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.02). In the year preceding the study, patients from both groups underwent two systemic antibiotic courses (p = 0.48). MRI total scores were 11.6 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 1 in PCD and CF, respectively. FEV1 and FVC Z-scores were -1.75 (range, -4.6-0.7) and -0.6 (-3.9-1.8) in PCD, and -0.9 (range, -5.4-2.3) and -0.3 (-3.4-2.5) in CF, respectively. No difference was found between lung function or structure, despite a higher MRI subscore of collapse/consolidation in PCD versus CF (1.6 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed after data-control for diagnostic delay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more frequent in CF than in PCD (p = 0.05 and p = 0.003, respectively). MRI is a valuable radiation-free tool for comparative PCD and CF lung disease assessment. Patients with PCD may exhibit similar MRI and lung function changes as CF subjects with mild pulmonary disease. Delay in PCD diagnosis is unlikely the only determinant of similarities.

Chronic respiratory tract infectious symptoms are sensitive but non-specific for the diagnosis of PCD. Nasal brushing for phase-contrast microscopy study of ciliary morphology and activity proved to be a fast, easy, non-invasive, cost-effective and age-independent diagnostic method. In doubtful cases, depending on local availability, further tests are indicated: nasal nitric oxide level, electronic microscopy, genetic study and cell culture. In suspected PCD, there being no gold standard method of screening and early diagnosis, nasal brushing with ciliary study is contributive, alongside numerous other complementary tests, on condition that the clinician is experienced and results are interpreted in the light of clinical examination and history-taking.

Mean offline nNO was determined at 660 ppb with the lower limit of the norm at 197 ppb. The use of offline eNO and nNO normal values should favour the widespread screening of respiratory diseases in children of school age in their usual environment.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive heterogeneous group of conditions with variable clinical findings. A 36-year-old nonsmoking Chinese man present to the emergency department of our hospital with acute-onset breathlessness and sudden-onset left-sided chest pain. The patient had 6 years primary infertility and suffered from recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections since childhood. Chest X-ray was performed, which showed a left-sided pneumothorax with lung collapse. His conditions improved in clinical symptoms after 3 days of closed thoracic drainage. Radiographic findings after lung recruitment revealed bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis but no situs inversus. Paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) showed maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinusitis. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated severe obstructive ventilation functional impairment. Bronchial mucosal cilia showed the absence of both outer and inner dynein arms of the microtubules (ODA and IDA). A culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. His clinical symptoms and CT images showed improvement after 1 month of treatment. A literature review revealed that few patients are diagnosed with PCD complicated with spontaneous pneumothorax. Within one year of follow-up, the patient showed good responses to local ICS+ LA beta2 agonist combined with oral carbocistein. Pneumothorax might be one of the complications of the PCD. Combination therapy including ICS+ LA beta2 agonist and carbocistein could be a potential therapy to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and delay progression of PCD.

Twenty-nine patients had lung clearance index (LCI) measured in 2009 and we attempted to perform a 5-year follow-up. Only 12 patients could be re-recruited, but in this small group LCI was stable over the 5 years, which confirms previous data showing that spirometry is also stable in these patients over the medium term. The two patients with the highest LCI in 2009 had since died, despite one having relatively preserved spirometry at the time. These data may be used to inform sample size calculations of future studies.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is clinically characterized by neonatal respiratory distress, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and infertility, and situs inversus in 50% of the patients. PCD is a result of mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in ciliary function, and is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Diagnosis of PCD is often a challenging task due to its high clinical and genetic heterogeneities. In the present study, we attempted to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with runs of homozygosity (ROH) approaches to identify the genetic defects in four Chinese consanguineous families with clinical PCD. We successfully identified three recently acknowledged PCD genes: DYX1C1, CCNO and ARMC4, and one well-characterized PCD gene, DNAI1. Our study provides compelling evidence that WES in combination with ROH analysis is an efficient diagnostic tool for identifying genetic causes of PCD in consanguineous families. Furthermore, our work expands the genetic mutation spectrum in PCD, and provides the additional tools to better serve the counseling of the families with PCD.

'Better Experimental Approaches to Treat Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia' (BEAT-PCD) is a network of scientists and clinicians coordinating research from basic science through to clinical care with the intention of developing treatments and diagnostics that lead to improved long-term outcomes for patients. BEAT-PCD activities are supported by EU Framework Programme Horizon 2020 funded COST Action (BM1407). The Inaugural Conference of BEAT-PCD was held in December 2015 in Southampton, UK. The conference attracted ninety-six scientists, clinicians, allied health professionals, industrial partners and patient representatives from twenty countries. We aimed to identify the needs for PCD research and clinical care, particularly focussing on basic science, epidemiology, diagnostic testing, clinical management and clinical trials. The multidisciplinary conference provided an interactive platform for exchanging ideas through a program of lectures, poster presentations, breakout sessions and workshops. This allowed us to develop plans for collaborative studies. In this report, we summarize the meeting, highlight developments, and discuss open questions thereby documenting ongoing developments in the field of PCD research.

"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia. Patients suffer from chronic infection and inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Diagnosis of PCD is confirmed by identification of a hallmark defect of ciliary ultrastructure or by identification of biallelic pathogenic mutations in a known PCD gene. Since the first description of PCD in 1976, assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been central to diagnosis and research. Electron tomography is a technique whereby a series of transmission electron micrographs are collected at different angles and reconstructed into a single 3D model of a specimen. Electron tomography provides improved spatial information and resolution compared to a single micrograph. Research by electron tomography has revealed new insight into ciliary ultrastructure and consequently ciliary function at a molecular and cellular level. Gene discovery studies in PCD have utilized electron tomography to define the structural consequences of variants in cilia genes. Modern transmission electron microscopes capable of electron tomography are increasingly being installed in clinical laboratories. This presents the possibility for the use of tomography technique in a diagnostic setting. This review describes the electron tomography technique, the contribution tomography has made to the understanding of basic cilia structure and function and finally the potential of the technique for use in PCD diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is predominantly an autosomal recessively inherited condition that affects ~1 in 15,000 people. Diagnosis of PCD can be complex and is ordinarily based on the results of multiple investigations. These investigations include nasal nitric oxide, high-speed video microscopy, genotyping, and electron microscopy analysis of ciliary ultrastructure. A diagnosis is ultimately confirmed by the presence of a hallmark defect identified by transmission electron microscopy or biallelic variants in a known PCD gene. Secondary ciliary defects are commonly seen in samples submitted for diagnosis of PCD. Acquired secondary ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities, which are not caused by a variant in a ciliary gene, are usually transient and reversible however failure to separate primary versus secondary defects can lead to misdiagnosis. In this review, we describe causes of secondary ciliary defects, identify the ultrastructural appearances associated with secondary ciliary dyskinesia and finally suggest methods to avoid misdiagnosis of PCD due to these acquired ciliary defects.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by functional impairment of cilia throughout the body. The early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long-term sequelae; however, this is often challenging because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD and difficulty in genetic analysis. The majority of PCD patients in Japan are not diagnosed properly. To diagnose PCD more accurately, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. We examined 46 patients (age range, 1-64 years; 23 male and 23 female) who were clinically suspected of PCD. First, mutation hotspots in DNAH5 and DNAI1 were sequenced by the Sanger method. Next, exome sequencing was performed in 32 known PCD genes using our novel NGS panel with the Ion Torrent PGM system. Variant annotation was generated by Ion Reporter Version 5.0 (Life Technologies). Mutations found in the panel were validated by Sanger sequencing. Disease-causing gene mutations were found in 10 patients from 7 families: DNAH5 in 4 families, and DNAI1, CCDC40, and RSPH4A in 1 family each. Heterozygous mutations were found in 1 patient. The majority of the mutations found in the present analysis were novel. Japanese PCD patients have novel mutations in cilia-related genes. This targeted NGS panel can identify disease-causing mutations in patients with PCD.

"	"Few studies have examined the potentially therapeutic effect of increasing the production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. Nasal NO is low in PCD and has been found to correlate with compromised Ciliary Beat Frequency (CBF). In this study we assessed the effect of increasing l-Arginine, as the substrate of NO synthases, on CBF in biopsies of human respiratory ciliated epithelium. A total of 28 suspect cases with chronic respiratory manifestations referred for PCD diagnostic testing and 8 healthy controls underwent nasal brushing. Obtained epithelial cells were divided between three culture medium 199 solutions, containing different levels of l-Arginine (0.33 mM as baseline, 1 mM and 10 Mm as increased levels). CBF measurements were obtained at 37 °C and 25 °C at 1, 3 and 24 h after sample acquisition. Among a total of 36 recruited subjects, 8 had PCD confirmed (PCD n = 8), 20 had PCD excluded (non-PCD n = 20) and 8 were healthy controls (Healthy Controls = 8). Among PCD subjects, ciliary motility was characterized by rotational (n = 5) or dyskinetic (n = 3) beating. At 37 °C, compared to baseline, higher levels of l-Arginine resulted in up to 9% CBF increase at 1 h (p = 0.007), up to 9% CBF increase at 3 h (p < 0.001) and up to 12% CBF increase at 24 h (p = 0.002). Similar although smaller scale increases were recorded at 25 °C. The effect of l-Arginine was time dependent (interaction p = 0.002) and was similar in PCD patients, non-PCD chronic respiratory patients and healthy controls (interaction p = 0.800). l-Arginine increases CBF and merits to be evaluated as a potential stimulator of mucociliary clearance in chronic respiratory conditions and congenital ciliary disorders with residual motility. Larger human studies are needed to confirm these findings.

"	"Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) suffer from recurrent upper and lower airway infections due to defects in the cilia present on the respiratory epithelium. Since chronic inflammatory conditions can cause changes in innate immune responses, we investigated whether monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of pediatric PCD patients respond differently to inflammatory stimuli, compared to monocytes from healthy children and adults. The receptor for C5a (C5aR) was upregulated in PCD, whereas expression levels of the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, BLT1 and FPR1 on PCD monocytes were similar to those on monocytes from healthy individuals. Also in vitro migration of PCD monocytes towards the ligands of those receptors (CCL2, fMLP, C5a and LTB4) was normal. Compared to healthy children, PCD patients had a higher percentage of the non-classic monocyte subset (CD14+CD16++) in circulation. Finally, PCD monocytes produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL18 and CCL22) in response to LPS, peptidoglycan and/or dsRNA stimulation. These data suggest that monocytes might exacerbate inflammatory reactions in PCD patients and might maintain a positive feedback-loop feeding the inflammatory process.

"	"A child presenting with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS), characterized by renal, retinal and skeletal involvements, was also diagnosed with lung infections and airway ciliary dyskinesia. These manifestations suggested dysfunction of both primary and motile cilia, respectively. Targeted exome sequencing identified biallelic mutations in WDR19, encoding an IFT-A subunit previously associated with MZSDS-related chondrodysplasia, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia and cranioectodermal dysplasia, linked to primary cilia dysfunction, and in TEKT1 which encodes tektin-1 an uncharacterized member of the tektin family, mutations of which may cause ciliary dyskinesia. Tektin-1 localizes at the centrosome in cycling cells, at basal bodies of both primary and motile cilia and to the axoneme of motile cilia in airway cells. The identified mutations impaired these localizations. In addition, airway cells from the affected individual showed severe motility defects without major ultrastructural changes. Knockdown of tekt1 in zebrafish resulted in phenotypes consistent with a function for tektin-1 in ciliary motility, which was confirmed by live imaging. Finally, experiments in the zebrafish also revealed a synergistic effect of tekt1 and wdr19. Altogether, our data show genetic interactions between WDR19 and TEKT1 likely contributing to the overall clinical phenotype observed in the affected individual and provide strong evidence for TEKT1 as a new candidate gene for primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Pure-tone audiometry revealed the mean air conduction thresholds to be 25.0 and 26.4 dB in the right and left ears, respectively. In the ears with better hearing and worse hearing, the mean air conduction thresholds were 22.3 and 29.0 dB respectively. Otologic disease among patients with PCD essentially comprised otitis media with effusion, and the patients' eardrums showed a variety of findings.

"	"The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) plays a central role in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. In most species, the N-DRC contains at least 11 subunits, but the specific function of each subunit is unknown. Mutations in three subunits (DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, DRC4/GAS8) have been linked to defects in ciliary motility in humans and lead to a ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Here we characterize the biochemical, structural, and motility phenotypes of two mutations in the DRC2 gene of Chlamydomonas Using high-resolution proteomic and structural approaches, we find that the C-terminal region of DRC2 is critical for the coassembly of DRC2 and DRC1 to form the base plate of N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubule. Loss of DRC2 in drc2 mutants disrupts the assembly of several other N-DRC subunits and also destabilizes the assembly of several closely associated structures such as the inner dynein arms, the radial spokes, and the calmodulin- and spoke-associated complex. Our study provides new insights into the range of ciliary defects that can lead to PCD.

We investigated height, body mass index (BMI), and lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).In this study, based on the international PCD (iPCD) Cohort, we calculated z-scores for height and BMI using World Health Organization (WHO) and national growth references, and assessed associations with age, sex, country, diagnostic certainty, age at diagnosis, organ laterality and lung function in multilevel regression models that accounted for repeated measurements.We analysed 6402 measurements from 1609 iPCD Cohort patients. Height was reduced compared to WHO (z-score -0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) and national references (z-score -0.27, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.21) in male and female patients in all age groups, with variation between countries. Height and BMI were higher in patients diagnosed earlier in life (p=0.026 and p<0.001, respectively) and closely associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity z-scores (p<0.001).Our study indicates that both growth and nutrition are affected adversely in PCD patients from early life and are both strongly associated with lung function. If supported by longitudinal studies, these findings suggest that early diagnosis with multidisciplinary management and nutritional advice could improve growth and delay disease progression and lung function impairment in PCD.

"	"Chronic cough in children is common and frequently mismanaged. In the past, cough was diagnosed as asthma and inappropriate asthma therapies prescribed and escalated. It has been realized that persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of wet cough and responds to oral antibiotics. The initial definition comprised a history of chronic wet cough, positive bronchoalveolar (BAL) cultures for a respiratory pathogen and response to a 2-week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This is now termed PBB-micro; PBB-clinical eliminates the need for BAL. PBB-extended is PBB-micro or PBB-clinical but resolution necessitating 4 weeks of antibiotics; and recurrent PBB is >3 attacks of PBB-micro or-clinical/year. However, the airway has only a limited range of responses to chronic inflammation and infection, and neutrophilic airway disease is seen in many other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, both chronic suppurative lung disease endotypes, whose recognition has led to huge scientific and clinical advances. There is an urgent need to extend endotyping into PBB, especially PBB-recurrent. We need to move from associative studies and, in particular, deploy sophisticated modern -omics technologies and systems biology, rather as has been done in the context of asthma in U-BIOPRED. In summary, the use of the term PBB has done signal service in pointing us away from prescribing asthma therapies to children with infected airways, but we now need to move beyond a simple description to teasing out underlying endotypes.

Cilia are pointing out from the cell surface and are involved in signal transduction from extracellular matrix, fluid flow and motility. It has been shown that cilia and cilia-related genes play essential role in commitment and differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts during bone formation. Here we show that SPEF2 is expressed in bone and cartilage. The analysis of a Spef2 knockout (KO) mouse model revealed hydrocephalus, growth retardation and death prior to five weeks of age. To further elucidate the causes of growth retardation we analyzed the bone structure and possible effects of SPEF2 depletion on bone formation. In Spef2 KO mice, long bones (tibia and femur) were shorter compared to wild type, and X-ray analysis revealed reduced bone mineral content. Furthermore, we showed that the in vitro differentiation of osteoblasts isolated from Spef2 KO animals was compromised. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel function for SPEF2 in bone formation through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone growth.

29362708	"Upper airway involvement in bronchiectasis is marked by early onset and allergic features
"	"The association of bronchiectasis with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been reported. However, apart from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), predisposing conditions have not been established. We aimed to define clinical and laboratory features that differentiate patients with bronchiectasis with upper airway symptoms (UASs) and without PCD from patients without UASs. We reviewed charts of adults with bronchiectasis, excluding CF and PCD. UASs were defined as nasal discharge most days of the year, sinusitis or nasal polyps. Laboratory data included IgG, total IgE, blood eosinophils, sputum bacteriology and lung function. A radiologist blinded to UAS presence scored bronchiectasis (Reiff score) and sino-nasal pathology (Lund-Mackay score). Of 197 patients, for the 70 (35%) with UASs, symptoms started earlier (34±25 versus 46±24 years; p=0.001), disease duration was longer (median 24 versus 12 years; p=0.027), exacerbations were more frequent (median 3 versus 2 per year; p=0.14), and peripheral blood eosinophil (median 230 versus 200 μL-1; p=0.015) and total IgE (median 100 versus 42 IU·mL-1; p=0.085) levels were higher. The sinus computed tomography score was independently associated with exacerbations, with 1 point on the Lund-Mackay score associated with a 1.03-fold increase in the number of exacerbations per year (95% CI 1.0-1.05; p=0.004). These findings may implicate a higher disease burden in patients with UASs. We hypothesise that UASs precede and may in some cases lead to the development of bronchiectasis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) both entail bronchiectasis and pulmonary impairment as measured using spirometry, during childhood. We aimed at looking whether blood gas exchanges progressed differently between CF and PCD children in a retrospective study of repeated measurements. Comparisons between groups (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests) and a mixed linear model, adjusted for age, evaluated associations between diseases and PaO2, PaCO2, or PaO2-PaCO2 ratio. Among 42 PCD and 73 CF children, 62% and 59% had respectively bronchiectasis (P = 0.75). Spirometry and blood gases were similar at inclusion (PaO2 median [IQR] PCD -1.80 [-3.40; -0.40]; CF -1.80 [-4.20; 0.60] z-scores; P = 0.72). PaO2 and PaO2-PaCO2 ratio similarly and significantly decreased with age in both groups (P < 0.01) whereas PaCO2 increased more in CF (P = 0.02) remaining within the range of normal (except for one child). To conclude, gas exchange characteristics, similarly initially impaired in PCD and CF children, tended to less deteriorate with time in PCD children who could benefit from an early diagnosis.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease with abnormalities in the structure of cilia, causing impairment of muco-ciliary clearance with respiratory tract infections, heterotaxia and abnormal sperm motility with male infertility. Here, with a comprehensive literature review, we report a couple with an infertility history of 9 years and three unsuccessful IVF treatments, where male partner has Kartagener's Syndrome, a subtype of PCD, displaying recurrent respiratory infections, dextrocardia and total asthenozoospermia. His diagnosis was verified with transmission electron microscopy and genetic mutation screening, revealing total absence of dynein arms in sperm tails and homozygous mutation in the ZMYND10, heterozygous mutations in the ARMC4 and DNAH5 genes. Laser assisted viability assay (LAVA) was performed by shooting the sperm tails during sperm retrieval for microinjection, following detection of pentoxifylline resistant immotile sperm. Live births of healthy triplets, one boy and two monozygotic girls, was achieved after double blastocyst transfer.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinical rare peculiar disorder, mainly featured by respiratory infection, tympanitis, nasosinusitis, and male infertility. Previous study demonstrated it is an autosomal recessive disease and by 2017 almost 40 pathologic genes have been identified. Among them are the leucine-rich repeat- (LRR-) containing 6 (LRRC6) codes for a 463-amino-acid cytoplasmic protein, expressed distinctively in motile cilia cells, including the testis cells and the respiratory epithelial cells. In this study, we applied whole-exome sequencing combined with PCD-known genes filtering to explore the genetic lesion of a PCD patient. A novel compound heterozygous mutation in LRRC6 (c.183T>G/p.N61K; c.179-1G>A) was identified and coseparated in this family. The missense mutation (c.183T>G/p.N61K) may lead to a substitution of asparagine by lysine at position 61 in exon 3 of LRRC6. The splice site mutation (c.179-1G>A) may cause a premature stop codon in exon 4 and decrease the mRNA levels of LRRC6. Both mutations were not present in our 200 local controls, dbSNP, and 1000 genomes. Three bioinformatics programs also predicted that both mutations are deleterious. Our study not only further supported the importance of LRRC6 in PCD, but also expanded the spectrum of LRRC6 mutations and will contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of PCD patients.

Optos ultra-widefield imaging of the fundus showed glaucomatous cupping, drusen, and retinal pigment epithelium changes within the macular region. Humphrey visual field testing confirmed glaucomatous changes. Drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments were observed bilaterally with optical coherence tomography. We hypothesize that in addition to the lungs, spermatozoa and the Fallopian tubes, the retinal pigment epithelium may also be affected by ciliary dysfunction in individuals with Kartagener syndrome. Given recent advances in our knowledge of retinal ciliopathies, further studies are needed to understand how ciliary dysfunction affects the retina in Kartagener syndrome.

"	"Intravital microscopy (IVM) offers the opportunity to visualize static and dynamic changes of tissue on a cellular level. It is a valuable tool in research and may considerably improve clinical diagnosis. In contrast to confocal and non-linear microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with microscopic resolution (mOCT) provides intrinsically cross-sectional imaging. Changing focus position is not needed, which simplifies especially endoscopic imaging. For in-vivo imaging, here we are presenting endo-microscopic OCT (emOCT). A graded-index-lens (GRIN) based 2.75 mm outer diameter rigid endoscope is providing 1.5 - 2 µm nearly isotropic resolution over an extended field of depth. Spherical and chromatic aberrations are used to elongate the focus length. Simulation of the OCT image formation, suggests a better overall image quality in this range compared to a focused Gaussian beam. Total imaging depth at a reduced sensitivity and lateral resolution is more than 200 µm. Using a frame rate of 80 Hz cross-sectional images of concha nasalis were demonstrated in humans, which could resolve cilial motion, cellular structures of the epithelium, vessels and blood cells. Mucus transport velocity was successfully determined. The endoscope may be used for diagnosis and treatment control of different lung diseases like cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, which manifest already at the nasal mucosa.

"	"Zinc finger MYND-type-containing 10 (ZMYND10), a cytoplasmic protein expressed in ciliated cells, causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) when mutated; however, its function is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we examined the roles of ZMYND10 using Zmynd10-/-mice exhibiting typical PCD phenotypes, including hydrocephalus and laterality defects. In these mutants, morphology, the number of motile cilia, and the 9+2 axoneme structure were normal; however, inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively) were absent. ZMYND10 interacted with ODA components and proteins, including LRRC6, DYX1C1, and C21ORF59, implicated in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of DAs, whose levels were significantly reduced in Zmynd10-/-mice. LRRC6 and DNAI1 were more stable when co-expressed with ZYMND10 than when expressed alone. DNAI2, which did not interact with ZMYND10, was not stabilized by co-expression with ZMYND10 alone, but was stabilized by co-expression with DNAI1 and ZMYND10, suggesting that ZMYND10 stabilized DNAI1, which subsequently stabilized DNAI2. Together, these results demonstrated that ZMYND10 regulated the early stage of DA cytoplasmic pre-assembly by stabilizing DNAI1.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by chronic airway disease, male infertility, and randomization of the left/right body axis as a result of defects of motile cilia and sperm flagella. We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open-reading frame C11orf70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11orf70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, as a result of the loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11orf70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11orf70 showed that C11orf70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11orf70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein-arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11orf70 is a preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of additional genetic defects that cause PCD and male infertility is of great importance for the clinic as well as for genetic counselling.

We report feasibility of measurement and natural evolution of nasal NO and upon the impact of respiratory tract infection (RTI) on nasal NO in healthy infants (HI), followed from birth until age 2 years, with comparison to nasal NO in infant PCD.Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurements were performed at scheduled visits at 2 weeks old and at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months old, with extra visits during RTIs. Historical nasal NO measurements for infant PCD were included for comparison.Altogether, 224 nasal NO measurements were performed in 44 enrolled infants. Median newborn nasal NO was 46 ppb (interquartile range (IQR) 29-69 ppb), increasing at a rate of 5.4% per month up to 283 ppb (IQR 203-389 ppb) at the age of 2 years. RTIs in 27 out of 44 infants temporarily suppressed nasal NO by 79%. Values for nasal NO in seven infants with PCD ranged from 6-80 ppb. The success rate to accept nasal NO sampling was 223 out of 224 measurements (99.6%).Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurement was indeed feasible in infancy and nasal NO in HI increased significantly up to 2 years of age, in opposition to nasal NO in PCD cases, which stayed low past 2 years of age. RTI episodes caused marked, temporary reductions in nasal NO in HI indistinguishable from that in infant PCD, suggesting that nasal NO should be measured in RTI-free intervals.

"	"Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is associated with morbidity and mortality in health and disease, and provides important information of global physical health not achieved from standard pulmonary function tests. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are genetically determined diseases involving different basic defects, but both showing impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic infections and pulmonary destruction early in life. PCD is generally considered a milder disease than CF and it is hypothesized that children with CF would have consistently lower VO2peak and pulmonary function than children with PCD. We performed a prospective, observational single-center, clinical cohort study of VO2peak and pulmonary function in age and gender matched schoolchildren, at two occasions 12 months apart. VO2peak was persistently (at baseline and after 12 months) and significantly reduced in the 22 patients with PCD (z-score = -0.89 and -1.0) and 24 with CF (z-score = -0.94 and -1.1), included in the study. Abnormal VO2peak was detected in a larger proportion of children with PCD (≈30%) than CF (≈13%). Moreover, children with PCD exhibited persistently lower FEV1 (p < 0.0001 at first visit and p = 0.001 at second visit) while FEF25-75 and FVC differed only at baseline. Indeed, a retrospective analysis comparing lung function over the last year in our entire PCD and CF populations between 6 and 18 years of age, revealed lower values in patients with PCD (FEV1 z-score, p = 0.0004, FVC z-score p < 0.0001, FEF25-75 z-score p = 0.008). This is the first report indicating that cardiopulmonary fitness is equally and consistently reduced in both children with PCD and CF along with a consistent lower pulmonary function in PCD compared with CF. A certain reservation for possible selection bias and the small number of patients is necessary. However, increased focus on early diagnosis, evidence-based treatment regimens and close clinical monitoring in PCD are warranted.

"	"Molecular chaperones promote the folding and macromolecular assembly of a diverse set of 'client' proteins. How ubiquitous chaperone machineries direct their activities towards specific sets of substrates is unclear. Through the use of mouse genetics, imaging and quantitative proteomics we uncover that ZMYND10 is a novel co-chaperone that confers specificity for the FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex towards axonemal dynein clients required for cilia motility. Loss of ZMYND10 perturbs the chaperoning of axonemal dynein heavy chains, triggering broader degradation of dynein motor subunits. We show that pharmacological inhibition of FKBP8 phenocopies dynein motor instability associated with the loss of ZMYND10 in airway cells and that human disease-causing variants of ZMYND10 disrupt its ability to act as an FKBP8-HSP90 co-chaperone. Our study indicates that primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), caused by mutations in dynein assembly factors disrupting cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors, should be considered a cell-type specific protein-misfolding disease.

Improvement in diagnostic testing is an area of current research. During diagnostic evaluation of PCD we observed ciliated conical protrusions from part of the apical surface of ciliated cells in those diagnosed with PCD. The aim of this study was to investigate if this abnormality was specific to PCD. Epithelial edges from 67 consecutively diagnosed PCD patients, 67 patients consecutively referred for PCD diagnostic testing in whom PCD was excluded, 22 with asthma and 18 with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were studied retrospectively in a blinded manner using light microscopy. Forty six out of 67 patients with PCD had ciliated conical epithelial protrusions, whereas none were seen in patients where PCD was excluded, or in patients with asthma or CF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the presence of the ciliated conical protrusions to predict a diagnosis of PCD were 76.5, 100, 100 and 77% respectively. Characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from ciliated epithelial cells maybe a useful pointer to the diagnosis of PCD. However, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of PCD.

Fifteen PCD patients aged 8-18 years and 31 age-matched healthy controls were compared. Ear, nose, and throat examination and home sleep testing were performed in PCD patients. Pediatric sleep questionnaire, Conners' Parents and Teacher scale and Stroop test were applied in both groups in order to investigate the relation between sleep disordered breathing and ADHD in PCD children. PCD patients had chronic rhinosinusitis (100%), tonsillar hypertrophy (80%) and adenoidal hypertrophy (60%). FEF25-75 was low in pulmonary function test. Sixty percent of the PCD patients had mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in home sleep testing. Mean AHI was 1.54 ± 0.27. Compared with the controls PCD patients had higher PSQ scores. Hyperactivity scores on Conners' Parents scale and inattention findings in Stroop test were higher in PCD patients than the healthy controls (P < 0.05). Most of PCD children had mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Hyperactivity and inattention findings were higher in PCD patients. Sleep disordered breathing assessment should be a routine part of PCD patients management and these patients should be carefully monitored in terms of hyperactivity and inattention.

This study aims to determine whether genetic mutations associated with defective airway host-defense are implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Based on the systematic screening of 32 frequently reported bronchiectasis-associated genes, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on peripheral blood samples from 192 bronchiectasis patients and 100 healthy subjects. The variant distribution frequency and pathogenicity of mutations were analyzed. We identified 162 rare variants in 192 bronchiectasis patients, and 85 rare variants among 100 healthy subjects. Among bronchiectasis patients, 25 (15.4%), 117 (72.2%) and 18 (11.1%) rare variants were associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR), epithelial sodium channel, and primary ciliary dyskinesia genes, respectively. Biallelic CFTR variants were detected in four bronchiectasis patients but none of the healthy subjects. Carriers of homozygous p.M470 plus at least one CFTR rare variant were detected in 6.3% of bronchiectasis patients (n=12) and in 1.0% of healthy subjects (n=1, P=0.039). Twenty-six patients (16 with idiopathic and 6 with post-infectious bronchiectasis) harbored biallelic variants. Bronchiectasis patients with biallelic DNAH5 variants, or biallelic CFTR variants plus an epithelial sodium channel variant, tended to have greater disease severity. Genetic mutations leading to impaired host-defense might have implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Genetic screening may be a useful tool for unraveling the underlying causes of bronchiectasis, and offers molecular information which is complementary to conventional etiologic assessment for bronchiectasis.

Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey® to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection.

The analysis methods strongly influenced LCI (mean±sd overall differences (%) between standard and alternative analysis methods: -4.9±5.7%; range: -66-19%), but did not improve intra-test variability. Discrimination between health and disease was comparable as areas under the receiver operator curves were not greater than that from standard analysis. This study supports current recommendations for LCI calculation in children. Alternative methods influence LCI estimates and hamper comparability between MBW setups.

We hypothesized that respiratory exosomes, nanovesicles circulating in the respiratory tract, may be involved in the progression of inflammation-related lung damage. We compared proteomic content of respiratory exosomes isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in CF and PCD to asthma (A), a condition also associated with inflammation but with less severe lung damage. BALF were obtained from 3 CF, 3 PCD and 6 A patients. Exosomes were isolated from BALF by ultracentrifugations and characterized using immunoelectron microscopy and western-blot. Exosomal protein analysis was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry using label-free quantification. Exosome enrichment was validated by electron microscopy and immunodetection of CD9, CD63 and ALIX. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the quantification of 665 proteins, of which 14 were statistically differential according to the disease. PCD and CF exosomes contained higher levels of antioxidant proteins (Superoxide-dismutase, Glutathione peroxidase-3, Peroxiredoxin-5) and proteins involved in leukocyte chemotaxis. All these proteins are known activators of the NF-KappaB pathway. Our results suggest that respiratory exosomes are involved in the pro-inflammatory propagation during the extension of CF or PCD lung diseases. The mechanism of local propagation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is not clearly understood. Differential Proteomic profiles of exosomes isolated from BAL from CF, PCD and asthmatic patients suggest that they carry pro-inflammatory proteins that may be involved in the progression of lung damage.

We calculated z-scores and % predicted values for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) using the Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 values for 991 patients from the international PCD Cohort. We then assessed associations with age, sex, country, diagnostic certainty, organ laterality, body mass index and age at diagnosis in linear regression models. Lung function in PCD patients was reduced compared to reference values in both sexes and all age groups. Children aged 6-9 years had the smallest impairment (FEV1 z-score -0.84 (-1.03 to -0.65), FVC z-score -0.31 (-0.51 to -0.11)). Compared to CF patients, FEV1 was similarly reduced in children (age 6-9 years PCD 91% (88-93%); CF 90% (88-91%)), but less impaired in young adults (age 18-21 years PCD 79% (76-82%); CF 66% (65-68%)). The results suggest that PCD affects lung function from early in life, which emphasises the importance of early standardised care for all patients.

30151187	"Bronchiectasis in PCD looks different to CF on CT scan
"	"The contemporary diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires CT scanning to describe specific structural lung changes. Scoring systems have been designed and validated in some specific causes of bronchiectasis to allow investigators to correlate CT changes with other indices of disease severity, to describe changes over time, with exacerbation and in response to treatment. Several scoring systems have been developed for CF including the Bhalla Score, Brody score, and the Helbich score. These scoring systems have also been applied to other causes of bronchiectasis including Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). This assumes that the nature of structural lung disease in these conditions, as well as the rate and nature of longitudinal changes are identical to, or at least very similar to, those found in CF. This assumption has not been tested. The underlying pathophysiology of PCD is not the same as CF and may cause bronchiectasis that is radiologically similar but not necessarily the same as CF or any other cause of bronchiectasis. The development of a disease specific scoring system for structural change in cases of non-CF bronchiectasis due to any cause, would require consideration of the full range of changes seen in that condition without reference to changes seen in other conditions. We present a summary of structural findings that have been described in PCD and highlight the radiological differences between PCD and other causes of bronchiectasis. We suggest that a PCD specific CT scoring system is required to properly describe changes seen in PCD.

This study investigated genotype-phenotype associations in PCD to facilitate risk predictions for cardiac and laterality defects. This retrospective cohort study of 389 UK patients with PCD found 51% had abnormal situs and 25% had CHD and/or laterality defects other than situs inversus totalis. Patients with biallelic mutations in a subset of nine PCD genes had normal situs. Patients with consanguineous parents had higher odds of situs abnormalities than patients with non-consanguineous parents. Patients with abnormal situs had higher odds of CHD and/or laterality defects.

"	"Congenital hydrocephalus results from cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the ventricles of the brain and causes severe neurological damage, but the underlying causes are not well understood. It is associated with several syndromes, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is caused by dysfunction of motile cilia. We previously demonstrated that mouse models of PCD lacking ciliary proteins CFAP221, CFAP54 and SPEF2 all have hydrocephalus with a strain-dependent severity. While morphological defects are more severe on the C57BL/6J (B6) background than 129S6/SvEvTac (129), cerebrospinal fluid flow is perturbed on both backgrounds, suggesting that abnormal cilia-driven flow is not the only factor underlying the hydrocephalus phenotype. Here, we performed a microarray analysis on brains from wild type and nm1054 mice lacking CFAP221 on the B6 and 129 backgrounds. Expression differences were observed for a number of genes that cluster into distinct groups based on expression pattern and biological function, many of them implicated in cellular and biochemical processes essential for proper brain development. These include genes known to be functionally relevant to congenital hydrocephalus, as well as formation and function of both motile and sensory cilia. Identification of these genes provides important clues to mechanisms underlying congenital hydrocephalus severity.

30230352	"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Modeling and Personalized Medicine
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and heterogeneous genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of motile cilia. In the airway epithelium, impaired ciliary motion results in reduced or absent mucociliary clearance that leads to the appearance of chronic airway infection, sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PCD, and research is limited by the lack of convenient models to study this disease and investigate innovative therapies. Furthermore, the high heterogeneity of PCD genotypes is likely to hinder the development of a single therapy for all patients. The generation of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their differentiation into airway epithelium as well as genome editing technologies could represent major tools for in vitro PCD modelling and for developing personalized therapies. Here, we review PCD pathogenesis, and then discuss how human iPSC could be used to model this disease for the development of innovative patient-specific biotherapies.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) are distinct disorders that can co-occur due to a common genetic locus on chromosome 5p. Chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD can occur in CdCS and are typically attributed to hypotonia, dysphagia, and aspiration. The prevalence of PCD among individuals with CdCS is not known. An online survey assessing common features of PCD was distributed to members of the 5P Minus Society, a cri du chat patient advocacy group. Respondents who met criteria for elevated risk of PCD (at least 3 symptoms or other features highly suggestive of PCD) were offered PCD genetic testing. For the 123 respondents (median age 10.1 years with IQR 5.5-17.3 years; from 33 U.S. states and 10 other countries) chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD were prevalent, including unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion beginning in infancy, and year-round, wet cough beginning in infancy in 35%, 32%, and 20% of respondents, respectively. Fifteen respondents (12%) met criteria for elevated risk for PCD and completed genetic analysis; however, none were diagnostic for PCD. A PCD clinical center evaluated an additional subject with CdCS who met criteria for likely PCD and had negative genetics, but had diagnostic electron microscopy of the respiratory cilia (missing outer dynein arms). Clinicians should be aware of the genetic connection between CdCS and PCD. Non-informative genetic testing does not rule out PCD. CdCS patients with chronic respiratory symptoms may benefit from referral to specialized PCD diagnostic centers.

"	"Motility is the most important property of mammalian sperm required for fertilization. Axoneme and axoneme surrounding tail components are the morphological substrate of sperm motility. Quantitative research methods of human spermatozoa motility allowed the definition of the normative parameters for fertile men. Exogenous factors, and, rarely, genetic defects may cause a significant reduction in sperm motility. Axonemal anomalies (absence of external and/or internal dynein arms, central pair of microtubules absence) may be the cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD—a severe systemic disease of the reduction of sperm motility—is just one symptom. Dysplasia of the fibrous sheath (DFO) is also genetically determined sperm motility decrease. PCD and the DFO are multigene diseases that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Modern molecular biological research methods are used to identify candidate genes. Assisted reproduction technologies (ART) allow men suffering from PCD and DFO to produce offspring. PCD and DFO symptoms appear in the homozygote. Children born after ART have the probability of being mutation carriers. We do not have complete information about etiological factor of genetically determined spermpathology. So we cannot assess the genetic risk degree. However, the possibility of mutations accumulation, which can be a risk factor for distant offspring, should be considered.

The Clinical Registry Investigating BBS, a worldwide registry exploring the phenotype and natural history of BBS, was used to conduct the study. Protected health information was obtained by subject or family interview and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved release of data including imaging studies and genetic testing. Echocardiography and imaging findings were independently confirmed by 2 cardiologists. Thoraco-abdominal abnormalities were identified in 6 of 368 (1.6%) subjects with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 60 Clinical Registry Investigating BBS participants. Diverse laterality defects were observed suggesting that the underlying ciliopathy randomly alters embryonic left-right axis orientation. Congenital heart disease, common in heterotaxy, was present in 2 subjects. Additional defects, uncommonly reported in BBS, were observed in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems in the subjects. No BBS genotype was favored in the cohort. One subject had genetic and clinical phenotype diagnostic of both primary ciliary dyskinesia and BBS. The variety of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in BBS suggests the pleiotropic nature of these anomalies is not confined to a single pattern or genotype. Clinicians providing care to individuals with BBS should consider the increased prevalence of thoraco-abdominal anomalies in BBS. Individuals with features suggestive of other ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, should undergo further evaluation for additional genetic disorders. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329210.

"	"In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the release of nitric oxide (NO) is extremely low by epithelia of the nasopharynx and sinuses. Measurement of nasal NO (nNO) is recommended as a screening test for PCD. The study aimed to evaluate if adenoids affects nNO and may deteriorate the performance of the test. In 48 nonallergic patients between 5 and 18 years of age with chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction and indications for adenoidectomy, the measurements of nNO by chemiluminescence analyser and nasal patency by active anterior rhinomanometry were performed both before and after adenoidectomy. Adenoidal tissue size was graded during surgery under general anaesthesia using transoral endoscopy. Patients were stratified into groups with adenoids grades 1, 2 and 3 (<1/3, 1/3-2/3 and > 2/3 of the choana and post-nasal space covered by adenoids). Before adenoidectomy, the median of nNO decreased with the increasing grade of adenoids (920, 663, and 491 ppb, P < 0.05). The rhinomanometry results were comparable and showed no correlation with nNO. Seven patients (14.6%) were incorrectly classified to have PCD based on a subthreshold value of the volume flow of nNO (FnNO < 77 nL/min). Following adenoidectomy, nNO of the grade 3 patients increased by 107 ppb (P < 0.05) and no differences were found between groups (P = 0.40). All patients had the postadenoidectomy FnNO >77 nL/min. nNO and FnNO are reduced in nonallergic children with obstructive adenoids. Adenoid hypertrophy can potentially cause a false positive result of the test for PCD.

"	"To determine whether adenoid epithelium is superior to nasal mucosa for biopsy of ciliated epithelium for electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate pediatric patients with rhinosinusitis for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A retrospective review compared electron microscopic results in children with chronic or recurrent rhinosinusitis who underwent both adenoidectomy or nasopharyngeal biopsy and nasal mucosa biopsy in the course of evaluation for PCD at a tertiary care institution. Forty pediatric patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Nine of these patients had a prior adenoidectomy and therefore underwent nasopharyngeal biopsy for collection of adenoid tissue. All nine of the nasopharyngeal biopsies and 25 of the 31 (80.6%) adenoid biopsies had sufficient cilia for EM evaluation of the ultrastructure. Of the 40 patients who also had a nasal biopsy, only 12 (30.0%) had sufficient cilia for EM analysis. The distribution of sufficient versus insufficient cilia for analysis between adenoid and nasal mucosa was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Abnormal cilia were found in only 2.5% of our patients. In current practice, the nasal cavity is a common location for obtaining ciliated epithelium for EM analysis, as it is easily accessible for biopsy and the procedure itself causes relatively low patient morbidity. Chronic rhinosinusitis, however, has been associated with decreased cilia density on nasal respiratory epithelium. Given that adenoidectomies are often performed in children with chronic rhinosinusitis, our data suggest that adenoid tissue is a better source of ciliated tissue for analysis compared to turbinate epithelium.

30431343	"Emerging Concepts and Therapies for Mucoobstructive Lung Disease
"	"A spectrum of intrapulmonary airway diseases, for example, cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, can be categorized as ""mucoobstructive"" airway diseases. A common theme for these diseases appears to be the failure to properly regulate mucus concentration, producing mucus hyperconcentration that slows mucus transport and, importantly, generates plaque/plug adhesion to airway surfaces. These mucus plaques/plugs generate long diffusion distances for oxygen, producing hypoxic niches within adherent airway mucus and subjacent epithelia. Data suggest that concentrated mucus plaques/plugs are proinflammatory, in part mediated by release of IL-1α from hypoxic cells. The infectious component of mucoobstructive diseases may be initiated by anaerobic bacteria that proliferate within the nutrient-rich hypoxic mucus environment. Anaerobes ultimately may condition mucus to provide the environment for a succession to classic airway pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and ultimately Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Novel therapies to treat mucoobstructive diseases focus on restoring mucus concentration. Strategies to rehydrate mucus range from the inhalation of osmotically active solutes, designed to draw water into airway surfaces, to strategies designed to manipulate the relative rates of sodium absorption versus chloride secretion to endogenously restore epithelial hydration. Similarly, strategies designed to reduce the mucin burden in the airways, either by reducing mucin production/secretion or by clearing accumulated mucus (e.g., reducing agents), are under development. Thus, the new insights into a unifying process, that is, mucus hyperconcentration, that drives a significant component of the pathogenesis of mucoobstructive diseases promise multiple new therapeutic strategies to aid patients with this syndrome.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder in which impaired ciliary function leads to chronic airway disease. Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs∗13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2). Further genetic screening of unrelated PCD subjects identified a second proband with a compound heterozygous variant carrying the identical frameshift variant and a large deletion (c.867_∗343+1207del; p.?) starting in exon 5. Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8 Hz versus control = 15.8 Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2-/- mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X. laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in PCD.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, hereditary, multiorgan disease caused by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia. It results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly in the upper and lower airways. Central data collection in national and international registries is essential to studying the epidemiology of rare diseases and filling in gaps in knowledge of diseases such as PCD. For this reason, the Swiss Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Registry (CH-PCD) was founded in 2013 as a collaborative project between epidemiologists and adult and paediatric pulmonologists. We describe the objectives and methodology of the CH-PCD, present initial results, and give an overview of current and ongoing projects.  The registry records patients of any age, suffering from PCD, who are treated and resident in Switzerland. It collects information from patients identified through physicians, diagnostic facilities and patient organisations. The registry dataset contains data on diagnostic evaluations, lung function, microbiology and imaging, symptoms, treatments and hospitalisations.  By May 2018, CH-PCD has contacted 566 physicians of different specialties and identified 134 patients with PCD. At present, this number represents an overall 1 in 63,000 prevalence of people diagnosed with PCD in Switzerland. Prevalence differs by age and region; it is highest in children and adults younger than 30 years, and in Espace Mittelland. The median age of patients in the registry is 25 years (range 5–73), and 41 patients have a definite PCD diagnosis based on recent international guidelines. Data from CH-PCD are contributed to international collaborative studies and the registry facilitates patient identification for nested studies.  CH-PCD has proven to be a valuable research tool that already has highlighted weaknesses in PCD clinical practice in Switzerland.    Trial registration number: NCT03606200

We investigated whether tidal breathing sampling for a few seconds was as discriminative between PCD and healthy controls (HC) as conventional tidal breathing sampling (cTB-nNO) for 20-30 s. We performed very rapid sampling of tidal breathing (vrTB-nNO) for 2, 4 and 6 s, respectively. Vacuum sampling with applied negative pressure (vrTB-nNOvac; negative pressure was applied by pinching the sampling tube) for < 2 s resulted in enhanced suction of nasal air during measurement. Feasibility, success rate, discriminatory capacity, repeatability and agreement were assessed for all four sampling modalities. We included 13 patients with PCD, median (IQR) age of 21.8 (12.2-27.7) years and 17 HC, 25.3 (14.5-33.4) years. Measurements were highly feasible (96.7% success rate). Measured NO values with vrTB-nNO modalities differed significantly from TB-nNO measurements (HC: p < 0.001, PCD: p < 0.05). All modalities showed excellent discrimination. The vacuum method gave remarkably high values of nNO in both groups (1865 vs. 86 ppb), but retained excellent discrimination. vrTB-nNO4sec, vrTB-nNO6sec and vrTB-nNOvac showed identical specificity to cTB-nNO (all: 1.0, 95% CI 0.77-1.0). vrTB-nNO sampling requires only a few seconds of probe-in-nose time, is feasible, and provides excellent discrimination between PCD and HC. Rapid TB-nNO sampling needs standardisation and further investigations in infants, young children and patients referred for PCD workup.

30774648	"Survey of the Ciliary Motility Machinery of Drosophila  Sperm and Ciliated Mechanosensory Neurons Reveals Unexpected Cell-Type Specific Variations: A Model for Motile Ciliopathies
"	"The motile cilium/flagellum is an ancient eukaryotic organelle. The molecular machinery of ciliary motility comprises a variety of cilium-specific dynein motor complexes along with other complexes that regulate their activity. Assembling the motors requires the function of dedicated ""assembly factors"" and transport processes. In humans, mutation of any one of at least 40 different genes encoding components of the motility apparatus causes Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of defective ciliary motility. Recently, Drosophila has emerged as a model for motile cilia biology and motile ciliopathies. This is somewhat surprising as most Drosophila cells lack cilia, and motile cilia are confined to just two specialized cell types: the sperm flagellum with a 9+2 axoneme and the ciliated dendrite of auditory/proprioceptive (chordotonal, Ch) neurons with a 9+0 axoneme. To determine the utility of Drosophila as a model for motile cilia, we survey the Drosophila genome for ciliary motility gene homologs, and assess their expression and function. We find that the molecules of cilium motility are well conserved in Drosophila. Most are readily characterized by their restricted cell-type specific expression patterns and phenotypes. There are also striking differences between the two motile ciliated cell types. Notably, sperm and Ch neuron cilia express and require entirely different outer dynein arm variants-the first time this has been clearly established in any organism. These differences might reflect the specialized functions for motility in the two cilium types. Moreover, the Ch neuron cilia lack the critical two-headed inner arm dynein (I1/f) but surprisingly retain key regulatory proteins previously associated with it. This may have implications for other motile 9+0 cilia, including vertebrate embryonic nodal cilia required for left-right axis asymmetry. We discuss the possibility that cell-type specificity in ciliary motility machinery might occur in humans, and therefore underlie some of the phenotypic variation observed in PCD caused by different gene mutations. Our work lays the foundation for the increasing use of Drosophila as an excellent model for new motile ciliary gene discovery and validation, for understanding motile cilium function and assembly, as well as understanding the nature of genetic defects underlying human motile ciliopathies.

"	"Developmental defects in motile cilia, arising from genetic abnormalities in one or more ciliary genes, can lead to a common ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Functional studies in model organisms undertaken to understand PCD or cilia biogenesis have identified 100s of genes regulated by Foxj1, the master regulator of motile ciliogenesis. However, limited systems based studies have been performed to elucidate proteins or network/s crucial to the motile ciliary interactome, although this approach holds promise for identification of multiple cilia-associated genes, which, in turn, could be utilized for screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Here, based on the assumption that FOXJ1-mediated regulatory and signaling networks are representative of the motile cilia interactome, we have constructed and analyzed the gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) mediated by FOXJ1. The predicted FOXJ1 regulatory network comprises of 424 directly and 148 indirectly regulated genes. Additionally, based on gene ontology analysis, we have associated 17 directly and 6 indirectly regulated genes with possible ciliary roles. Topological and perturbation analyses of the PPIN (6927 proteins, 40,608 interactions) identified 121 proteins expressed in ciliated cells, which interact with multiple proteins encoded by FoxJ1 induced genes (FIG) as important interacting proteins (IIP). However, it is plausible that IIP transcriptionally regulated by FOXJ1 and/or differentially expressed in PCD are likely to have crucial roles in motile cilia. We have found 20 de-regulated topologically important effector proteins in the FOXJ1 regulatory network, among which some (PLSCR1, SSX2IP, ACTN2, CDC42, HSP90AA1, PIAS4) have previously reported ciliary roles. Furthermore, based on pathway enrichment of these proteins and their primary interactors, we have rationalized their possible roles in the ciliary interactome. For instance, 5 among these novel proteins that are involved in cilia associated signaling pathways (like Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Toll-like receptor etc.) could be 'topologically important signaling proteins.' Therefore, based on this FOXJ1 network study we have predicted important effectors in the motile cilia interactome, which are possibly associated with ciliary biology and/or function and are likely to further our understanding of the pathophysiology in ciliopathies like PCD.

Polymorphisms in the MBL gene named MBL2 result in unstable and low functional levels MBL proteins. MBL insufficiency is linked to an increased risk of lung infection and to declines in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. We investigated whether there is a similar link in patients with PCD. This retrospective longitudinal study included 85 patients with PCD. Diagnostics and age at diagnosis were recorded, complete spirometry data starting at diagnosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status over the last 2 years were collected, and the patients were grouped according to MBL2 genotype status (MBL2-sufficient or MBL2-deficient). MBL-deficient patients were diagnosed almost 3 years earlier than MBL-sufficient patients (median 6.1 vs 8.9 years, P  < 0.05). There were no differences in the first measured spirometry values, but MBL-deficient patients showed greater declines in forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1 ) than patients with MBL sufficiency (z-score: -0.049 per year [95% CI, -0.075; -0.021] vs -0.009 per year [95% CI, -0.033; 0.015]; P = 0.023). No differences were found in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, or infection status. MBL-deficiency, which is associated with MBL2 mutations, was associated with a lower age at diagnosis and with steeper declines in FEV1 in patients with PCD. This suggests that the MBL genotype might be a disease modifier in PCD.

31019772	"Additional role of bronchial mucosal biopsy for ciliary structural abnormality in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia
"	"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of diagnostic tests for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The mucosal samples obtained for cilia examination are generally procured from the nasal turbinate, but these specimens often yield inadequate results. The bronchial mucosa is recognized as an alternative sample, but no study has examined the additional utility of bronchial mucosa compared with nasal mucosa in the diagnosis of PCD. The medical records of 96 patients who underwent TEM for suspected PCD between April 1997 and June 2017 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on the site of mucosal biopsy: nasal biopsy (NB) group with nasal mucosal biopsy only; bronchial biopsy (BB) group with bronchial mucosal biopsy only; and nasal and bronchial biopsy (NBB) group with a combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsies. The rate of PCD diagnosis was 28.8% (17/59) in the NB group, 41.2% (7/17) in the BB group, and 60.0% (12/20) in the NBB group. The yield of PCD diagnosis significantly increased in the NBB group compared with the NB group (P=0.012). In the NBB group, 25.0% (5/20) of patients were diagnosed with PCD by nasal mucosal biopsy, and 35.0% (7/20) of patients were additionally diagnosed by bronchial mucosal biopsy. The presence of sinusitis or bronchiectasis was not associated with prediction of PCD diagnosis from nasal or bronchial mucosal biopsy. The combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsy for TEM showed higher yields of PCD diagnosis than nasal mucosal biopsy alone.

Its prevalence varies from 1/15 000 to 1/30 000 but it is estimated that a lot of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have not been diagnosed as such. Its clinical presentation is non-specific and heterogeneous, and there is not a single, gold standard, diagnostic test. The diagnosis is often delayed because of these reasons and limitations and no availability of diagnostic tests. Early diagnosis and treatment change patient's prognosis. In addition, Scientific Societies have published recent diagnostic algorithm to evaluate the patient with suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia. Therefore, it is important to keep up to date with all the latest articles. We present the case of a newborn with this syndrome diagnosed by genetic analysis in a secondary care hospital.

"	"Nearly all motile cilia have a ""9+2"" axoneme containing a central apparatus (CA), consisting of two central microtubules with projections, that is essential for motility. To date, only 22 proteins are known to be CA components. To identify new candidate CA proteins, we used mass spectrometry to compare axonemes of wild-type Chlamydomonas and a CA-less mutant. We identified 44 novel candidate CA proteins, of which 13 are conserved in humans. Five of the latter were studied more closely, and all five localized to the CA; therefore, most of the other candidates are likely to also be CA components. Our results reveal that the CA is far more compositionally complex than previously recognized and provide a greatly expanded knowledge base for studies to understand the architecture of the CA and how it functions. The discovery of the new conserved CA proteins will facilitate genetic screening to identify patients with a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia that has been difficult to diagnose.

"	"By definition bronchiectasis (BE) means destructed structure of normal bronchus as a consequence of frequent bacterial infections and inflammation. In many senses, BE is a neglected orphan disease. A recent pan-European registry study, EMBARC, has been set up in order to better understand its pathophysiology, better phenotype patients, and to individualize their management. To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland. Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study. Baseline demographics, lung functions, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data, together with co-morbidities were entered into EMBARC database. Clinical characteristics, aetiologic factors, co-morbidities, and risk factors for extensive BE were explored. To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD ± 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1). Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE.

"	"Reduced or no progressive sperm motility in the fresh ejaculate defines asthenozoospermia as one of the major causes of male infertility. The axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene encodes for one of the axonemal dynein heavy chain (DHC) family members and participates in assembling respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. Given the high degree of conservation of DNAH11, mutations could give rise to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and asthenozoospermia. To date, few studies have reported on the association between variants in DNAH11 and asthenozoospermia. In the present study, 87 patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia for variants in DNAH11 were screened by using high-throughput targeted gene sequencing technology. Bioinformatics analysis was further assessed. We found compound heterozygous variants (c.9484-1 G>T, c.12428 T>C) of DNAH11 detected in 1 of 87 patients. The variant c.9484-1 G>T was confirmed as a novel virulence variant which was predicted to affect splicing by Human Splicing Finder 3.1. And c.12428 T>C was predicted to be mildly pathogenic in silico analysis. We found that DNAH11 polymorphisms display strong associations with asthenozoospermia, and may contribute to an increased risk of male infertility in Chinese patients.

"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is underdiagnosed in Brazil. We enrolled patients from an adult service of Bronchiectasis over a two-year period in a cross-sectional study. The inclusion criteria were laterality disorders (LD), cough with recurrent infections and the exclusion of other causes of bronchiectasis. Patients underwent at least two of the following tests: nasal nitric oxide, ciliary movement and analysis of ciliary immunofluorescence, and genetic tests (31 PCD genes + CFTR gene). The clinical characterization included the PICADAR and bronchiectasis scores, pulmonary function, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cPA) colonization, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and mucus rheology (MR). Forty-nine of the 500 patients were diagnosed with definite (42/49), probable (5/49), and clinical (2/49) PCD. Twenty-four patients (24/47) presented bi-allelic pathogenic variants in a total of 31 screened PCD genes. A PICADAR score > 5 was found in 37/49 patients, consanguinity in 27/49, LD in 28/49, and eight PCD sibling groups. FACED diagnosed 23/49 patients with moderate or severe bronchiectasis; FEV1 ≤ 50% in 25/49 patients, eight patients had undergone lung transplantation, four had been lobectomized and cPA+ was determined in 20/49. The EBC and MR were altered in all patients. This adult PCD population was characterized by consanguinity, severe lung impairment, genetic variability, altered EBC and MR.

"	"Calaxin is a Ca2+-binding dynein-associated protein that regulates flagellar and ciliary movement. In ascidians, calaxin plays essential roles in chemotaxis of sperm. However, nothing has been known for the function of calaxin in vertebrates. Here we show that the mice with a null mutation in Efcab1, which encodes calaxin, display typical phenotypes of primary ciliary dyskinesia, including hydrocephalus, situs inversus, and abnormal motility of trachea cilia and sperm flagella. Strikingly, both males and females are viable and fertile, indicating that calaxin is not essential for fertilization in mice. The 9 + 2 axonemal structures of epithelial multicilia and sperm flagella are normal, but the formation of 9 + 0 nodal cilia is significantly disrupted. Knockout of calaxin in zebrafish also causes situs inversus due to the irregular ciliary beating of Kupffer's vesicle cilia, although the 9 + 2 axonemal structure appears to remain normal.

"	"To study CCDC103 expression profiles and understand how pathogenic variants in CCDC103 affect its expression profile at mRNA and protein level. To increase the knowledge about the CCDC103, we attempted genotype-phenotype correlations in two patients carrying novel homozygous (missense and frameshift) CCDC103 variants. Whole-exome sequencing, quantitative PCR, Western blot, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunogold labelling were performed to characterize CCDC103 expression profiles in reproductive and somatic cells. Our data demonstrate that pathogenic variants in CCDC103 gene negatively affect gene and protein expression in both patients who presented absence of DA on their axonemes. Further, we firstly report that CCDC103 is expressed at different levels in reproductive tissues and somatic cells and described that CCDC103 protein forms oligomers with tissue-specific sizes, which suggests that CCDC103 possibly undergoes post-translational modifications. Moreover, we reported that CCDC103 was restricted to the midpiece of sperm and is present at the cytoplasm of the other cells. Overall, our data support the CCDC103 involvement in PCD and suggest that CCDC103 may have different assemblies and roles in cilia and sperm flagella biology that are still unexplored.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder. Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] ≥ 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a motile ciliopathy, whose symptoms include airway infections, male infertility and situs inversus. Apart from the typical forms of PCD, rare syndromic PCD forms exist. Mutations of the X-linked OFD1 gene cause several syndromic ciliopathies, including oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome type 10 (JBTS10), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2, the latter causing the X-linked syndromic form of PCD. Neurological and skeletal symptoms are characteristic for these syndromes, with their severity depending on the location of the mutation within the gene. To elucidate the role of motile cilia defects in the respiratory phenotype of PCD patients with C-terminal OFD1 mutations. Whole-exome sequencing in a group of 120 Polish PCD patients, mutation screening of the OFD1 coding sequence, analysis of motile cilia, and magnetic resonance brain imaging. Four novel hemizygous OFD1 mutations, in exons 20 and 21, were found in men with a typical PCD presentation but without severe neurological, skeletal or renal symptoms characteristic for other OFD1-related syndromes. Magnetic resonance brain imaging in two patients did not show a molar tooth sign typical for JBTS10. Cilia in the respiratory epithelium were sparse, unusually long and displayed a defective motility pattern. Consistent with the literature, truncations of the C-terminal part of OFD1 (exons 16-22) almost invariably cause a respiratory phenotype (due to motile cilia defects) while their impact on the primary cilia function is limited. We suggest that exons 20-21 should be included in the panel for regular mutation screening in PCD.

In this study, two unrelated Portuguese children with strong PCD suspicion underwent extensive clinical and genetic assessments by whole-exome sequencing (WES), as well as ultrastructural analysis of cilia by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to identify their genetic etiology. These analyses confirmed the diagnostic of Kartagener syndrome (KS) (PCD with situs inversus). Patient-1 showed a predominance of the absence of the inner dynein arms with two disease-causing variants in the CCDC40 gene. Patient-2 showed the absence of both dynein arms and WES disclosed two novel high impact variants in the DNAH5 gene and two missense variants in the DNAH7 gene, all possibly deleterious. Moreover, in Patient-2, functional data revealed a reduction of gene expression and protein mislocalization in both genes' products. Our work calls the researcher's attention to the complexity of the PCD and to the possibility of gene interactions modelling the PCD phenotype. Further, it is demonstrated that even for well-known PCD genes, novel pathogenic variants could have importance for a PCD/KS diagnosis, reinforcing the difficulty of providing genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis to families.

In the case of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), even less is known. This study aims to compare the caregiver burden of the parents of patients with CF and PCD. Patients with CF and PCD between the ages of 6 to 13 and their parents were included. Patients' clinical information and parents' demographics were recorded. Caregiver burden was measured with Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCB), while the quality of life (QOL) was measured with CFQOL-revised (CFQOL-R) and PCD QOL questionnaire as the patients' age and diagnosis indicated. A total of 63 patients, 44 with CF (69%) and 85 caregivers (35 mothers, 6 fathers, and 22 mother-father dyads) participated in the study. Caregiver burden was significantly higher in mothers of the CF group with a mean ZCB of 30.5 ± 10.7 when compared to the PCD group with a mean ZCB of 21.93 ± 8.26 (P = .006). This was similar in fathers with mean ZCB of 27.5 ± 9.21 in the CF group and 20.36 ± 7.43 in the PCD group (P = .03). In correlation analyses, mothers' caregiver burden moderately and inversely correlated with CFQOL-R subscales in the CF population. Caregiver burden is significantly higher in the CF population when compared to PCD. It is correlated with pulmonary functions and QOL in patients with CF.

Forty clinically diagnosed patients with PCD belonging to 34 families were recruited from Tunisian pediatric departments. In each proband, targeted capture PCD panel sequencing of the 40 PCD genes was performed. PCD panel sequencing identified bi-allelic mutations in 82% of the families in eight PCD genes. Remarkably, 23.5% of patients carried the same c.2190del CCDC39 mutation. Single nucleotide polymorphism profiling in six unrelated patients carrying this mutation has revealed a founder effect in North-African patients. This mutation is estimated to date back at least 1,400-1,750 years ago. The identification of this major allele allowed us to suggest a cost-effective genetic diagnostic strategy in North-African patients with PCD.

Children (n = 71), adolescents (n = 85), and parents (n = 68) from multiple centers in the UK and North America completed age-appropriate QOL-PCD and generic QOL measures: pediatric QOL inventory, COPD assessment test (CAT), and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20.

Multitrait analysis evaluated how the items loaded to hypothesized scales: physical, emotional & social functioning, treatment burden, role, vitality, upper and lower respiratory symptoms, and ears and hearing symptoms. Examination of item-to-total correlations led to removal of three, five, and six items, respectively in the prototype child, adolescent and parent-proxy versions; the validated measures now comprise between 34 and 38 items. The QOL-PCD scales had good internal consistency; Cronbach's α for QOL-PCD parent-proxy ranged 0.62 to 0.86. Test-retest reliability demonstrated stability across all scales; for example QOL-PCD adolescent intraclass correlation coefficients ranged 0.71 to 0.89. Significant relationships were found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, QOL-PCD adolescent lower respiratory symptoms and the CAT score (r = .64, P < .01); weaker correlations were found between different constructs. Age-specific QOL-PCD demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary defect of motile cilia in humans and several domestic animal species. Typical clinical findings are chronic recurrent infections of the respiratory tract and fertility problems. We analyzed an Alaskan Malamute family, in which two out of six puppies were affected by PCD. The parents were unaffected suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Linkage and homozygosity mapping defined critical intervals comprising ~118 Mb. Whole genome sequencing of one case and comparison to 601 control genomes identified a disease associated frameshift variant, c.43delA, in the NME5 gene encoding a sparsely characterized protein associated with ciliary function. Nme5-/- knockout mice exhibit doming of the skull, hydrocephalus and sperm flagellar defects. The genotypes at NME5:c.43delA showed the expected co-segregation with the phenotype in the Alaskan Malamute family. An additional unrelated Alaskan Malamute with PCD and hydrocephalus that became available later in the study was also homozygous mutant at the NME5:c.43delA variant. The mutant allele was not present in more than 1000 control dogs from different breeds. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated absence of the NME5 protein from nasal epithelia of an affected dog. We therefore propose NME5:c.43delA as the most likely candidate causative variant for PCD in Alaskan Malamutes. These findings enable genetic testing to avoid the unintentional breeding of affected dogs in the future. Furthermore, the results of this study identify NME5 as a novel candidate gene for unsolved human PCD and/or hydrocephalus cases.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous chronic destructive airway disease. PCD is traditionally diagnosed by nasal nitric oxide measurement, analysis of ciliary beating, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and/or genetic testing. In most genetic PCD variants, laterality defects can occur. However, it is difficult to establish a diagnosis in individuals with PCD and central pair (CP) defects, and alternative strategies are required because of very subtle ciliary beating abnormalities, a normal ciliary ultrastructure, and normal situs composition. Mutations in HYDIN are known to cause CP defects, but the genetic analysis of HYDIN variants is confounded by the pseudogene HYDIN2, which is almost identical in terms of intron/exon structure. We have previously shown that several types of PCD can be diagnosed via immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy analyses. Here, using IF microscopy, we demonstrated that in individuals with PCD and CP defects, the CP-associated protein SPEF2 is absent in HYDIN-mutant cells, revealing its dependence on functional HYDIN. Next, we performed IF analyses of SPEF2 in respiratory cells from 189 individuals with suspected PCD and situs solitus. Forty-one of the 189 individuals had undetectable SPEF2 and were subjected to a genetic analysis, which revealed one novel loss-of-function mutation in SPEF2 and three reported and 13 novel HYDIN mutations in 15 individuals. The remaining 25 individuals are good candidates for new, as-yet uncharacterized PCD variants that affect the CP apparatus. SPEF2 mutations have been associated with male infertility but have not previously been identified to cause PCD. We identified a mutation of SPEF2 that is causative for PCD with a CP defect. We conclude that SPEF2 IF analyses can facilitate the detection of CP defects and evaluation of the pathogenicity of HYDIN variants, thus aiding the molecular diagnosis of CP defects.

"	"The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is difficult and requires a combination of clinical features, nasal nitric oxide testing, cilia ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy (EM), and genetics. A recently described cytoplasmic ultrastructural change termed ""ciliary inclusions"" was reported to be diagnostic of PCD; however, no supporting evidence of PCD was provided. In this study, we sought to confirm, or refute, the diagnosis of PCD in subjects with ""ciliary inclusions"" on EM. Six subjects from five families with previous lab reports of ""ciliary inclusions"" on EMs of ciliated cells were identified and evaluated at a Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium site. We performed a detailed clinical history, nasal nitric oxide measurement, genetic testing including whole-exome sequencing (WES), and when possible, repeat ciliary EM study. Only one of six subjects had multiple and persistent clinical features congruent with PCD. No subject had situs inversus. Only one of six subjects had a very low nasal nitric oxide level. No ""ciliary inclusions"" were found in three subjects who had a repeat ciliary EM, and ciliary axonemal ultrastructures were normal. Genetic testing, including WES, was negative for PCD-causing genes, and for pathogenic variants in gene pathways that might cause ""ciliary inclusions,"" such as ciliary biogenesis. ""Ciliary Inclusions"", in isolation, are not sufficient to diagnosis PCD. If seen, additional studies should be done to pursue an accurate diagnosis.

"	"Nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease, represents genetically heterogenous group of diseases that lead to end-stage kidney disease in children and young adults. The typical clinical manifestations are polyuria, enuresis and growth failure. Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare form of cardiomyopathy, is determined by the disturbance of embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder of motile cilia characterised by chronic lung disease and nonpulmonary manifestations, usually situs inversus. Almost no information is available in the literature about the association between nephronophthisis, left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy and reduced cilia motility. The authors present the case of 17 year-old girl with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, non-specific lung nodules and end-stage kidney disease. A genetic examination confirmed only diagnosis of nephronophthisis type I. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Cilia motility was reduced in nasal mucosa samples. Are all clinical manifestations part of one disease? This report points to a variety of clinical manifestations of ciliopathy and aims to understand the individual relationships.

"	"To evaluate whether cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants are more common among individuals tested for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) compared with controls. Data were studied from 1021 individuals with commercial genetic testing for suspected PCD and 91 777 controls with genetic testing at the same company (Invitae) for symptoms/diseases unrelated to PCD or CFTR testing. The prevalence of CFTR variants was compared between controls and each of 3 groups of individuals tested for PCD (PCD-positive, -uncertain, and -negative molecular diagnosis). The prevalence of 1 pathogenic CFTR variant was similar among the individual groups. When combining the PCD-uncertain and PCR-negative molecular diagnosis groups, there was a higher prevalence of single pathogenic CFTR variants compared with controls (P = .03). Importantly, >1% of individuals who had negative genetic testing results for PCD had 2 pathogenic CFTR variants (8 of 723), and the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) (2 pathogenic variants) is roughly 1 in 3000 individuals of Caucasian ethnicity (∼0.03%). This incidence was also greater than that of 2 pathogenic CFTR variants in the control population (0.09% [84 of 91 777]; P = 9.60 × 10-16). These variants correlate with mild CFTR-related disease. Our results suggest that a single pathogenic CFTR variant is not likely to be a PCD-mimetic, but ongoing studies are needed in individuals in whom PCD is suspected and genetic testing results are uncertain or negative. Furthermore, CF may be misdiagnosed as PCD, reflecting phenotypic overlap. Among individuals evaluated for PCD, CF should be considered in the differential even in the CF newborn screening era.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder of motile cilia dysfunction generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Genetic testing is increasingly considered an early step in the PCD diagnostic workflow. We used targeted panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) for genetic screening of 33 Egyptian families with clinically highly suspected PCD. All variants prioritized were Sanger confirmed in the affected individuals and correctly segregated within the family. Targeted NGS yielded a high diagnostic output (70%) with biallelic mutations identified in known PCD genes. Mutations were identified in 13 genes overall, with CCDC40 and CCDC39 the most frequently mutated genes among Egyptian patients. Most identified mutations were predicted null effect variants (79%) and not reported before (85%). This study reveals that the genetic landscape of PCD among Egyptians is highly heterogeneous, indicating that a targeted NGS approach covering multiple genes will provide a superior diagnostic yield compared to Sanger sequencing for genetic diagnosis. The high diagnostic output achieved here highlights the potential of placing genetic testing early within the diagnostic workflow for PCD, in particular in developing countries where other diagnostic tests can be less available.

"	"Three-dimensional respiratory tissue models have been generated using, for example, human primary airway epithelial cells (hAEC) or respective cell lines. To investigate ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, the presence of functional kinocilia in vitro is an essential prerequisite. Since access to hAEC of healthy donors is limited, we aimed to identify a respiratory epithelial cell line that is capable to display functional kinocilia on at least 60% of the apical surface. Thus, we cultured four different human respiratory cell lines with human primary airway fibroblasts under airlift conditions, characterized the morphology, and analyzed ciliary function. Only one of the tested cell lines showed beating kinocilia; however, <10% of the whole surface was covered and ciliary beating was undirected. Positive control tissue models using hAEC and fibroblasts displayed expected directed ciliary beating pattern around 11 Hz. Our data show that the available cell lines are not suitable for basic and applied research questions whenever functional kinocilia are required and that, rather, hAEC- or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue models need to be generated. Impact Statement To study ciliopathies or Bordetella pertussis infection in vitro, three-dimensional respiratory tissue models with functional kinocilia covering at least 60% of the model's surface are mandatory. We cultured four respiratory cell lines on a fibroblast-loaded biological scaffold and showed that none of them met this requirement. In contrast, primary airway cell-derived models sufficiently reflected the mucociliary phenotype. To further search for an alternative to primary respiratory cells, investigations on other cell lines should be conducted or even new cell lines have to be generated.

"	"The human nasal epithelium contains basal stem/progenitor cells that produce differentiated multiciliated and mucosecretory progeny. Basal epithelial cells can be expanded in cell culture and instructed to differentiate at an air-liquid interface using transwell membranes and differentiation media. For basal cell expansion, we have used 3T3-J2 co-culture in epithelial culture medium containing EGF, insulin, and a RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632 (3T3 + Y). Here we describe our protocols for ciliated differentiation of these cultures at air-liquid interface and compare four commercially available differentiation media, across nine donor cell cultures (six healthy, two patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and one with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)). Bright-field and immunofluorescence imaging suggested broad similarity between differentiation protocols. Subtle differences were seen in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), ciliary beat frequency, mucus production, and the extent to which basal cells are retained in differentiated cultures. Overall, the specific differentiation medium used in our air-liquid interface culture protocol was not a major determinant of ciliation, and our data suggest that the differentiation potential of basal cells at the outset is a more critical factor in air-liquid interface culture outcome. Detailed information on the constituents of the differentiation media was only available from one of the four manufacturers, a factor that may have profound implications in the interpretation of some research studies.

"	"Bronchial epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening occurs in diseases with both eosinophilic (allergic bronchial asthma [BA]) and neutrophilic (cystic fibrosis [CF] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]) chronic airway inflammation; however, the lung function and airway remodeling relation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to test whether ventilation inhomogeneity is related to RBM thickening. Multiple breath washout test, endobronchial biopsy, and BAL were performed in 24 children with CF, 11 with PCD, 15 with BA, and in 19 control subjects. Lung clearance index at 2.5% (1/40th) of starting nitrogen concentration (LCI2.5), RBM thickness, and lavage fluid cytology were quantified; their mutual associations were studied by using Spearman rank correlations (r). In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity (mean ± SD) was mild (LCI2.5, 9.3 ± 1.4 vs 7.9 ± 0.9 in control subjects; P = .0391), and the RBM thickened (5.26 ± 0.98 μm vs 3.12 ± 0.62 μm in control subjects; P < .0001). No relation between RBM thickness and ventilation inhomogeneity or lavage cytology was found. In CF and PCD, RBM thickness was similar to that in asthma (4.54 ± 0.66 μm and 5.27 ± 1.11 μm, respectively), but ventilation inhomogeneity was significantly higher (LCI2.5, 12.5 ± 2.4 and 11.8 ± 2.5). Both in CF and PCD, RBM thickness correlated with LCI2.5 (r = 0.594, P = .015; r = 0.821, P = .023). In PCD only, RBM thickness was also related to the number of neutrophils in lavage fluid (r = 0.821; P = .023). Lung function impairment in relation to RBM thickness was milder in BA than in CF and PCD. In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity did not correlate with RBM thickness, whereas it did in CF and PCD. This outcome suggests a different structure-function relation in these diseases.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in abnormal ciliary motility/structure, extremely heterogeneous at genetic and ultrastructural levels. We aimed, in light of extensive genotyping, to identify specific and quantitative ciliary beating anomalies, according to the ultrastructural phenotype. We prospectively included 75 patients with PCD exhibiting the main five ultrastructural phenotypes (n=15/group), screened all corresponding PCD genes and measured quantitative beating parameters by high-speed video-microscopy (HSV). Sixty-eight (91%) patients carried biallelic mutations. Combined outer/inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA) defect induces total ciliary immotility, regardless of the gene involved. ODA defect induces a residual beating with dramatically low ciliary beat frequency (CBF) related to increased recovery stroke and pause durations, especially in case of DNAI1 mutations. IDA defect with microtubular disorganisation induces a low percentage of beating cilia with decreased beating angle and, in case of CCDC39 mutations, a relatively conserved mean CBF with a high maximal CBF. Central complex defect induces nearly normal beating parameters, regardless of the gene involved, and a gyrating motion in a minority of ciliated edges, especially in case of RSPH1 mutations. PCD with normal ultrastructure exhibits heterogeneous HSV values, but mostly an increased CBF with an extremely high maximal CBF. Quantitative HSV analysis in PCD objectives beating anomalies associated with specific ciliary ultrastructures and genotypes. It represents a promising approach to guide the molecular analyses towards the best candidate gene(s) to be analysed or to assess the pathogenicity of the numerous sequence variants identified by next-generation-sequencing.

"	"CCDC103 is a small protein with unusual biophysical properties that is required for outer dynein arm assembly on ciliary axonemes. Mutations in both human and zebrafish CCDC103 proteins lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia. Previous studies revealed that this protein can oligomerize and appears to be arrayed along the entire length of the ciliary axoneme. CCDC103 also binds purified microtubules directly and indeed stabilizes them. Here we use biochemical approaches to identify two regions of CCDC103 that mediate self-interaction. In both cases, these associations are stable to heating in the presence of detergent and are not disrupted by strong reducing agents. One interaction region consists of a 27-residue inherently disorder segment that can mediate heat/detergent-resistant dimerization when attached to unrelated monomeric proteins. The second interface includes the C-terminal RPAP3_C alpha helical domain. Our data suggest that CCDC103 can form an unconventional polymer and we propose models for how the monomers might be organized. We also use molecular modeling of the RPAP3_C domain to determine the structural consequences of the pathogenic H154P mutation found in human PCD patients.

"	"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer found in the nasopharynx with high metastatic and invasive nature. Increasing evidences have identified the critical role of gene therapy in NPC treatment. Hence, this study was designed to identify specific gene markers that affected NPC progression through gene expression profile analysis. NPC-related gene expression data set gene set enrichment (GSE)53819 were retrieved and analyzed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by determination of their expression in noncancerous tissues and NPC specimens. Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted on DEGs to obtain tumor-associated gene modules. Genes in those modules were intersected with DEGs for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Then protein-protein interaction network of tumor-associated genes was constructed to select genes most closely linked to NPC. Afterward, expression of chromosome 9 open reading frame 24 (c9orf24), primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (PCDP1), and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 46 (LRRC46) was detected in GSE53819 and further verified in GSE12452 and GSE64634. Differential analysis on GSE53819 found that 2,173 genes were aberrantly expressed in NPC, among which 917 genes are upregulated and 1,256 genes are downregulated. WGCNA showed that genes were enriched in 17 modules and 727 genes exhibited ectopic expression in NPC and enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis signaling pathways, among which c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 were poorly expressed in NPC. Therefore, c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 might serve as prominent diagnostic markers for NPC, which presents new insights for NPC therapy.

Strikingly, both males and females are viable and fertile, indicating that calaxin is not essential for fertilization in mice. The 9 + 2 axonemal structures of epithelial multicilia and sperm flagella are normal, but the formation of 9 + 0 nodal cilia is significantly disrupted.

"	"Cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved organelles whose motility relies on the outer and inner dynein arm complexes (ODAs and IDAs). Defects in ODAs and IDAs result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease characterized by recurrent airway infections and male infertility. PCD mutations in assembly factors have been shown to cause a combined ODA-IDA defect, affecting both cilia and flagella. We identified four loss-of-function mutations in TTC12, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein, in four independent families in which affected individuals displayed a peculiar PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of ODAs and IDAs in sperm flagella, contrasting with the absence of only IDAs in respiratory cilia. Analyses of both primary cells from individuals carrying TTC12 mutations and human differentiated airway cells invalidated for TTC12 by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed an IDA defect restricted to a subset of single-headed IDAs that are different in flagella and cilia, whereas TTC12 depletion in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia recapitulated the sperm phenotype. Overall, our study, which identifies TTC12 as a gene involved in PCD, unveils distinct dynein assembly mechanisms in human motile cilia versus flagella.

Further, a novel homozygous nonsynonymous RSPH3 mutation (c.C799T: p.Arg267Cys) was identified in another PCD patient with consanguineous parents. The pathogenicity of these mutations in the assembly of sperm flagella was confirmed by flagellar ultrastructure analysis, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. All five patients underwent six ICSI cycles. The fertilization rate, blastocyst development rate, and clinical pregnancy rate were 69.3%, 50.0%, and 66.7%, respectively. Four of the five couples, including the subjects carrying mutations in SPAG6 or RSPH3, got healthy children born after ICSI. Additionally, the ICSI outcomes of the five PCD couples were statistically comparable with those of the eight DNAH1-mutated couples and the 215 OAT couples. Mutations in ciliopathy-related SPAG6 and RSPH3 cause severe asthenoteratospermia characterized by multiple flagellar malformations, resulting in sterility.

"	"Airway clearance of pathogens and particulates relies on motile cilia. Impaired cilia motility can lead to reduction in lung function, lung transplant, or death in some cases. More than 50 proteins regulating cilia motility are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a heterogeneous, mainly recessive genetic lung disease. Accurate PCD molecular diagnosis is essential for identifying therapeutic targets and for initiating therapies that can stabilize lung function, thereby reducing socioeconomic impact of the disease. To date, PCD diagnosis has mainly relied on nonquantitative methods that have limited sensitivity or require a priori knowledge of the genes involved. Here, we developed a quantitative super-resolution microscopy workflow: (i) to increase sensitivity and throughput, (ii) to detect structural defects in PCD patients' cells, and (iii) to quantify motility defects caused by yet to be found PCD genes. Toward these goals, we built a localization map of PCD proteins by three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy and implemented quantitative image analysis and machine learning to detect protein mislocalization, we analyzed axonemal structure by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, and we developed a high-throughput method for detecting motile cilia uncoordination by rotational polarity. Together, our data show that super-resolution methods are powerful tools for improving diagnosis of motile ciliopathies.

32235794	"Knowledge of Rare Respiratory Diseases among Paediatricians and Medical School Students
"	"Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are underdiagnosed rare diseases showing a median diagnostic delay of five to ten years, which has negative effects on patient prognosis. Lack of awareness and education among healthcare professionals involved in the management of these patients have been suggested as possible causes. Our aim was to assess knowledge of these diseases among paediatricians and medical school students to determine which knowledge areas are most deficient. A survey was designed with questions testing fundamental aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of AATD and PCD. A score equal to or greater than 50% of the maximum score was set as the level necessary to ensure a good knowledge of both diseases. Our results indicate a profound lack of knowledge of rare respiratory diseases among paediatric professionals and medical students, suggesting that it is necessary to increase rare respiratory diseases training among all physicians responsible for suspecting and diagnosing them; this will allow early diagnosis and the setup of preventive measures and appropriate early-stage treatment. The first step in closing this knowledge gap could be to include relevant material in the medical syllabus.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by an alteration in the ciliary structure causing difficulty in the clearance of respiratory secretions. Diagnosis is complex and based on a combination of techniques. The objective of this study was to design a gene panel including all known causative genes, and to corroborate their diagnostic utility in a cohort of Spanish patients. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of patients with a high suspicion of PCD, according to European Respiratory Society criteria, designed around a gene panel for massive sequencing using SeqCap EZ capture technology that included 44 genes associated with PCD. We included 79 patients, 53 of whom had a diagnosis of confirmed or highly probable PCD. The sensitivity of the gene panel was 81.1%, with a specificity of 100%. Candidate variants were found in some of the genes of the panel in 43 patients with PCD, 51.2% (22/43) of whom were homozygotes and 48.8% (21/43) compound heterozygotes. The most common causative genes were DNAH5 and CCDC39. We found 52 different variants, 36 of which were not previously described in the literature. The design and implementation of a tailored gene panel produces a high yield in the genetic diagnosis of PCD. This panel provides a better understanding of the causative factors involved in these patients and lays down the groundwork for future therapeutic approaches.

"	"Recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract are one of the major clinical features of the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disease due to malfunctioning of motile cilia. Chronic infections and persistent inflammation of the respiratory system result in progressive lung disease. Aim of the study was to highlight the main factors associated with clinical, functional and anatomical deterioration in PCD patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 58 patients with PCD, 37 adults and 21 children. The demographic and clinical data, forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), sputum microbiology and imaging results (chest CT scores-modified Bhalla) were recorded. Patients were stratified according to the number of exacerbations (< 2/year vs ≥ 2/year) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization. The possible correlations between lung function and chest CT scores were assessed; we also evaluated the correlation between these parameters and the severity scores for bronchiectasis (BSI, FACED and e-FACED). Chest CT scores showed a significant correlation with FEV1 (p = 0.0002), age (p <  0.0001), BMI (p = 0.0002) and number of lung lobes involved (p <  0.0001). PA colonization had an overall prevalence of 32.6%: no significant difference in FEV1 between PA colonized and non-colonized patients was found (p = 0.70), while chest CT score was significantly worse in chronic PA colonized patients (p = 0.009). Patients with a high number of exacerbation (≥ 2/year) were older (p = 0.01), had lower FEV1 (p = 0.03), greater number of lobes involved (p < 0.001) and worse CT score than patients with low number of exacerbations (p = 0.001); they also had higher prevalence of PA chronic bronchial infection (33.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.10). Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for gender, age and BMI showed positive associations between PA colonization and number of exacerbations with severity of disease (number of lobes involved, CT score, BSI, FACED, and e-FACED). In our PCD population the number of exacerbations (≥ 2/year) and PA colonization were the two most relevant factors associated with severity of disease.

"	"Kartagener syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder with a triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus, is characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic inflammation of the lung. Information on comorbidities other than infections in patients with Kartagener syndrome is currently limited. A 39-year-old, non-smoking female was diagnosed with Kartagener syndrome and admitted to Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Japan. Computed tomography revealed an endobronchial massive shadow at the ostial site of the right upper lobe bronchus with atelectasis of the right upper lobe. The mass was surgically resected and pathologically diagnosed as mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The lesion had no vascular invasions and no metastases to the lungs or lymph nodes. The surgical margin was negative for carcinoma. Following surgery, the patient has been in good condition. The present case showed different clinicopathological characteristics from those previously reported in cases of Kartagener syndrome complicated by carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a young, non-smoking female with comorbid Kartagener syndrome and pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This case report may provide a new perspective on the complications of Kartagener syndrome.

32380069	"Efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia (BESTCILIA): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial
"	"Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD. The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</≥ 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0·75 (SD 1·12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1·62 (1·64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·26-0·78]; p=0·004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

"	"Kartagener's syndrome (KS) is a ciliopathic, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The abnormal ciliary structure and function lead to variable clinical manifestations, including dextrocardia, pneumonia, bronchitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, reduced fertility in women, and infertility in men. This article reports our experience on general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in a patient with KS. A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with chronic nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, chronic sinusitis, and chronic non-productive cough for FESS. The patient's heart was on the right side of his chest. A chest roentgenogram and a high﻿-resolution chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan identified dextrocardia, situs inversus, and chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis involving both lung bases. CT sinuses showed mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary and ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The patient was prescribed oral medications and nasal spray for crepitations and wheezes heard over bilateral lung fields. Intensive chest physiotherapy and supportive care prior to surgery were provided to prevent worsening of lung function. FESS with bilateral frontal polypectomy was performed. All hemodynamic parameters were stable. The emergence from anesthesia was smooth. After ~20 minutes in the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was fully awake and pain-free. He was then transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and subsequently to the ward. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient felt subjectively ""very well"" and was discharged from the hospital on the 2nd postoperative day. Anesthesiologists must be aware of cardiopulmonary inversion that could challenge the management of patients with KS. To avoid respiratory depression caused by long-acting systemic opioids, we suggest using short-acting opioids during general anesthesia and for postoperative pain relief.

Often benign, it may be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic respiratory disease. Yet, prenatal diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia has not been reported. We describe a pregnancy in which situs inversus was diagnosed by fetal ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation. Prenatal testing for primary ciliary dyskinesia led to the discovery that both parents were asymptomatic carriers of a pathogenic mutation in the CCDC103 gene, with an affected neonate.

32482850	"CAMSAP3 facilitates basal body polarity and the formation of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia
"	"Synchronized beating of cilia on multiciliated cells (MCCs) generates a directional flow of mucus across epithelia. This motility requires a ""9 + 2"" microtubule (MT) configuration in axonemes and the unidirectional array of basal bodies of cilia on the MCCs. However, it is not fully understood what components are needed for central MT-pair assembly as they are not continuous with basal bodies in contrast to the nine outer MT doublets. In this study, we discovered that a homozygous knockdown mouse model for MT minus-end regulator calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3), Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , exhibited multiple phenotypes, some of which are typical of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition caused by motile cilia defects. Anatomical examination of Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  mice revealed severe nasal airway blockage and abnormal ciliary morphologies in nasal MCCs. MCCs from different tissues exhibited defective synchronized beating and ineffective generation of directional flow likely underlying the PCD-like phenotypes. In normal mice, CAMSAP3 localized to the base of axonemes and at the basal bodies in MCCs. However, in Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , MCCs lacked CAMSAP3 at the ciliary base. Importantly, the central MT pairs were missing in the majority of cilia, and the polarity of the basal bodies was disorganized. These phenotypes were further confirmed in MCCs of Xenopus embryos when CAMSAP3 expression was knocked down by morpholino injection. Taken together, we identified CAMSAP3 as being important for the formation of central MT pairs, proper orientation of basal bodies, and synchronized beating of motile cilia.

"	"The prevalence of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is increasing in both developed and developing countries in recent years. Although the main features remain similar, etiologies seem to change. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of our recent non-CF bronchiectasis patients and to compare these with our historical cohort in 2001. One hundred four children with non-CF bronchiectasis followed between 2002 and 2019 were enrolled. Age of diagnosis, underlying etiology and microorganisms in sputum culture were recorded. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of lung function tests and annual pulmonary exacerbation rates at presentation and within the last 12 months. Mean FEV1 and FVC %predicted at presentation improved compared to historical cohort (76.6 ± 17.1 vs. 63.3 ± 22.1 and 76.6 ± 15.1 vs. 67.3 ± 23.1, respectively; p <  0.001). There was a significant decrease in pulmonary exacerbation rate from 6.05 ± 2.88 at presentation to 3.23 ± 2.08 during follow-up (p <  0.0001). In 80.8% of patients, an underlying etiology was identified. There was an increase in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (32.7% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.001), decrease in idiopathic cases (19.2% vs. 37.8%; p = 0.03) with no change in postinfectious and immunodeficiencies as underlying etiology. Sputum cultures were positive in 77.9% of patients which was 46.9% in the historical cohort (p = 0.001). Baseline pulmonary function tests were better and distribution of underlying etiology had changed with a remarkable increase in diagnosis of PCD in the recent cohort.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically diverse disease which causes impaired mucociliary clearance, and results in pulmonary, otologic, and rhinologic disease in affected patients. Genetic mutations in multiple genes impair the ability of patients to clear mucous from the lungs, middle ear, and sinonasal cavity and lead to chronic pulmonary and sinonasal symptoms. We identified 17 PCD patients who had available CT scans. Volumes for bilateral maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses were calculated. A control population of patients who had preoperative CT scans for endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base pathology without sinonasal cavity involvement was also identified. The mean age of PCD was 33 and ranged from 13 to 54 years. Patients were age- and gender-matched to a control group that underwent resection of anterior skull-base tumors and had a mean age of 35 that ranged between 17-53 years old. The volumes for all thee sinus cavities were significantly smaller (p < 0.007) compared to the control population. The average Lund-Mackay score was 10.6 in the PCD cohort (range 6-16) in comparison to an average of 0.7 in the control cohort (range 0-2). Overall sinus volumes were smaller in patients with PCD compared to our control population. Future studies will be aimed at understanding defects in sinus development as a function of specific genetic mutations in PCD patients. Ultimately, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of PCD will allow us to identify the optimal treatment practices for this unique patient group.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, ciliopathic disorder. In many ciliopathies, dental anomalies are observed alongside other symptoms of the disease. To date, there are no published reports concerning the dental developmental problems that are associated with ciliary defects in PCD patients. Patients suffering from PCD underwent dental clinical examination, which included the assessment of developmental disorders regarding the number and morphological structure of the teeth (size and shape) as well as developmental disorders of mineralised dental tissues. Then, three-dimensional radiographic examination was performed utilising Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Four PCD patients, aged 31-54, agreed to enter the study. Dental examinations showed the presence of dental developmental disorders in three of them. Additionally, CBCT showed abnormalities in those patients. 1. The dental phenotype in PCD patients seems to be heterogeneous. Tooth developmental disorders resulting from abnormal odontogenesis may be a symptom of PCD that is concomitant with other developmental abnormalities resulting from malfunctioning primary cilia. 2. Patients with ciliopathies are likely to develop dental developmental defects. Therefore, beginning in early childhood, they should be included in a targeted specialised dental programme to enable early diagnosis and to ensure dedicated preventive and therapeutic measures.

32603187	"Comparison of Multiple Breath Washout and Spirometry in Children with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and Cystic Fibrosis and Healthy Controls
"	"Rationale: In cystic fibrosis (CF), the lung clearance index (LCI), derived from multiple breath washout (MBW), is more sensitive in detecting early lung disease than FEV1; MBW has been less thoroughly evaluated in young patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).Objectives: Our objectives were 1) to evaluate the sensitivity of MBW and spirometry for the detection of mild lung disease in young children with PCD and CF compared with healthy control (HC) subjects and 2) to compare patterns of airway obstruction between disease populations.Methods: We used a multicenter, single-visit, observational study in children with PCD and CF with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than 60% predicted and HC subjects, ages 3-12 years. Nitrogen MBW and spirometry were performed and overread for acceptability. χ2 and Kruskall-Wallis tests compared demographics and lung function measures between groups, linear regression evaluated the effect of disease state, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient compared the LCI and spirometric measurements.Results: Twenty-five children with PCD, 49 children with CF, and 80 HC children were enrolled, among whom 17 children with PCD (68%), 36 children with CF (73%), and 53 (66%) HC children performed both acceptable spirometry and MBW; these children made up the analytic cohort. The median age was 9.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.8-11.1). The LCI was abnormal (more than 7.8) in 10 of 17 (59%) patients with PCD and 21 of 36 (58%) patients with CF, whereas FEV1 was abnormal in three of 17 (18%) patients with PCD and six of 36 (17%) patients with CF. The LCI was significantly elevated in patients with PCD and CF compared with HC subjects (ratio of geometric mean vs. HC: PCD 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.39; and CF 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33]). Children with PCD had lower midexpiratory-phase forced expiratory flow % predicted compared with children with CF (62% [IQR, 50-78%] vs. 85% [IQR, 68-99%]; P = 0.05). LCI did not correlate with FEV1.Conclusions: The LCI is more sensitive than FEV1 in detecting lung disease in young patients with PCD, similar to CF. LCI holds promise as a sensitive endpoint for the assessment of early PCD lung disease.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome that results from defects in motile cilia. The ciliary axoneme has a 9 + 2 microtubule structure consisting of nine peripheral doublets surrounding a central pair apparatus (CPA), which plays a critical role in regulating proper ciliary function. We have previously shown that mouse models with mutations in CPA genes CFAP221, CFAP54, and SPEF2 have a PCD phenotype with defects in ciliary motility. In this study, we investigated potential genetic interaction between these CPA genes by generating each combination of double heterozygous and double homozygous mutants. No detectable cilia-related phenotypes were observed in double heterozygotes, but all three double homozygous mutant lines exhibit early mortality and typically develop severe PCD-associated phenotypes of hydrocephalus, mucociliary clearance defects in the upper airway, and abnormal spermatogenesis. Double homozygous cilia are generally intact and display a normal morphology and distribution. Spermiogenesis is aborted in double homozygotes, with an absence of mature flagella on elongating spermatids and epididymal sperm. These findings identify genetic interactions between CPA genes and genetic mechanisms regulating the CPA and motile cilia function.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) causes chronic infections and progressive bronchiectasis that can lead to severe lung disease. Because there are no cures or regenerative therapy options for PCD, treatment of severe lung disease in PCD is focused on managing symptoms, including aggressive administration of antibiotics and diligent airway clearance. The Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) does not recommend routine lobectomy, reserving its use for ""rare cases of PCD with severe, localized bronchiectasis"" and warns that a lobectomy should be treated with caution. However, if aggressive medical management fails, selective surgical removal of severely defective lung may result in maintenance or improvement of pulmonary function. Certainly, the decision to recommend lung resection in the face of chronic bronchiectasis from PCD requires an extensive discussion before it is considered as an alternative treatment. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate that in selected cases of unilobar disease with bronchiectasis that are not responsive to other therapies (antibiotics and airway clearance), removal of localized necrotic areas of the lung along with prophylactic antibiotics can improve the quality of life of children with PCD associated bronchiectasis and improve growth and nutritional status, and pulmonary function.

"	"To report a neuroradiologic phenotype associated with reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) and mutations in the multicilin gene. We hypothesize that the observed phenotype may reflect the emerging role that ependymal cilia play in regulating CSF production. Clinical and radiologic records were retrospectively reviewed for 7 consecutive patients diagnosed by the Leicester UK national primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostic laboratory. On MRI scanning, all patients demonstrated hydrocephalus, choroid plexus hyperplasia (CPH), and arachnoid cysts. No patient had any sign of neurologic deficit. All patients had significant lung disease. We conclude that there is a high incidence of hydrocephalus, arachnoid cysts, and CPH in MCIDAS-associated RGMC. In all cases, the observed hydrocephalus seems arrested in childhood without progression or adverse neurologic sequelae. Our new observation of CPH, which is associated with CSF overproduction, is the first macroscopic evidence that ependymal cilia may be involved in the regulation of CSF production and flow. We suggest that brain imaging should be performed in all cases of RGMC and that a diagnosis of PCD or RGMC be strongly considered in patients with unexplained hydrocephalus and a lifelong ""wet""-sounding cough.

The whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed a homozygotic nonsense mutation in the dynein, axonemal, heavy chain (DNAH) 5 gene, and heterozygotic missense mutation in the DNAH11 gene. This is the first report of the co-occurrence of the two rare diseases. A case of a 48-year-old woman was presented with hemiplegia and slurred speech. The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed acute cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia region, semi-oval center, insular lobe, and frontal parietal lobe. The electrocardiogram showed inverted ""P"" waves in L1 and AVL on left-sided chest leads and computed tomography scan of the chest showed bronchiectasis changes, cardiac shadow and apex on the right side, and situs inversus of aortic arch position. The digital subtraction angiography showed inversion of the aortic arch, and bilateral internal carotid arteries are occluded from the ophthalmic segment. The clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings made the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome and moyamoya syndrome. The whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed a homozygotic nonsense mutation in DNAH5 gene, and heterozygotic missense mutation in the DNAH11 gene. The combined mutation of DNAH5 and DNAH11 may lead to the overlapping dysfunction of motile and nonmotile cilia, which contribute to the co-occurrence of Kartagener syndrome and moyamoya syndrome. Our report deserves further confirm by more case reports.

The transcript has been subsequently associated to four different X-linked recessive conditions, namely Joubert syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, primary ciliary dyskinesia and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel type 2 syndrome. The centrosomal/basal body OFD1 protein has indeed been shown to be required for primary cilia formation and left-right asymmetry. The protein is also involved in other tasks, e.g. regulation of cellular protein content, constrain of the centriolar length, chromatin remodeling at DNA double strand breaks, control of protein quality balance and cell cycle progression, which might be mediated by non-ciliary activities.

An increased number of multitask protein, such as OFD1, may represent a partial explanation to human complexity, as compared with less complex organisms with an equal or slightly lower number of proteins.

"	"Neonatal respiratory distress (NRD) is common among infants with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but we do not know whether affected neonates receive a timely diagnosis. We used data from the international PCD cohort and assessed the proportion of patients with PCD who had a history of NRD and their age at diagnosis, stratifying by presence of laterality defects. First we analyzed data from all participants diagnosed after 2000, followed by individuals from a subgroup diagnosed using stricter criteria. Among the 1375 patients in the study, 45% had a history of NRD and 42% had laterality defects. Out of the 476 children with definite PCD diagnosis, 55% had a history of NRD and 50% had laterality defects. Overall, 30% of children with PCD were diagnosed during the first 12 months of life. This varied from 13% in those with situs solitus and no NRD, to 21% in those with situs solitus and NRD, 33% in those with situs anomalies but no NRD, and 52% in those with both situs anomalies and NRD. Our results suggest that we need to improve our knowledge of the neonatal presentation of infants with PCD and apply it so that these patients will receive appropriate care sooner.

"	"Chest computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for detecting structural abnormalities in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) such as bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and mucus plugging. There are no studies on quantitative assessment of airway and artery abnormalities in children with PCD. The objectives of the present study were to quantify airway and artery dimensions on chest CT in a cohort of children with PCD and compare these with control children to analyse the influence of covariates on airway and artery dimensions. Chest CTs of 13 children with PCD (14 CT scans) and 12 control children were collected retrospectively. The bronchial tree was segmented semi-automatically and reconstructed in a three-dimensional view. All visible airway-artery (AA) pairs were measured perpendicular to the airway centre line, annotating per branch inner and outer airway and adjacent artery diameter and computing inner airway diameter/artery ratio (AinA ratio), outer airway diameter/artery ratio (AoutA ratio), wall thickness (WT), WT/outer airway diameter ratio (Awt ratio) and WT/artery ratio. In the children with PCD (38.5% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 9.8-15.3) 1526 AA pairs were measured versus 1516 in controls (58.3% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 8-14.8). AinA ratio and AoutA ratio were significantly higher in children with PCD than in control children (both p<0.001). Awt ratio was significantly higher in control children than in children with PCD (p<0.001). Our study showed that in children with PCD airways are more dilated than in controls and do not show airway wall thickening.

32977348	"Management of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, MIM 242650) is a rare, hereditary multiorgan disease characterized by malfunction of motile cilia. Hallmark symptom is a chronic airway infection due to mucostasis leading to irreversible lung damage that may progress to respiratory failure. There is no cure for this genetic disease and evidence-based treatment is limited. Until recently, there were no randomized controlled trials performed in PCD, but this year, data of the first placebo-controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD were published. This cornerstone in the management of PCD was decisive for reviewing currently used treatment strategies. This article is a consensus of patient representatives and clinicians, which are highly experienced in care of PCD-patients and provides an overview of the management of PCD. Treatments are mainly based on expert opinions, personal experiences, or are deduced from other lung diseases, notably cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD or bronchiectasis. Most strategies focus on routine airway clearance and treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infections. Non-respiratory symptoms are treated organ specific. To generate further evidence-based knowledge, other projects are under way, e. g. the International PCD-Registry. Participating in patient registries facilitates access to clinical and research studies and strengthens networks between centers. In addition, knowledge of genotype-specific course of the disease will offer the opportunity to further improve and individualize patient care.

32996775	"PCD Detect: enhancing ciliary features through image averaging and classification
"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder of the motile cilia. Early accurate diagnosis is important to help prevent lung damage in childhood and to preserve lung function. Confirmation of a diagnosis traditionally relied on assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, >50 known PCD genes have made the identification of biallelic mutations a viable alternative to confirm diagnosis. TEM and genotyping lack sensitivity, and research to improve accuracy of both is required. TEM can be challenging when a subtle or partial ciliary defect is present or affected cilia structures are difficult to identify due to poor contrast. Here, we demonstrate software to enhance TEM ciliary images and reduce background by averaging ciliary features. This includes an option to classify features into groups based on their appearance, to generate multiple averages when a nonhomogeneous abnormality is present. We validated this software on images taken from subjects with well-characterized PCD caused by variants in the outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH5. Examining more difficult to diagnose cases, we detected 1) regionally restricted absence of the ODAs away from the ciliary base, in a subject carrying mutations in DNAH9; 2) loss of the typically poorly contrasted inner dynein arms; and 3) sporadic absence of part of the central pair complex in subjects carrying mutations in HYDIN, including one case with an unverified genetic diagnosis. We show that this easy-to-use software can assist in detailing relationships between genotype and ultrastructural phenotype, improving diagnosis of PCD.

"	"Chest physiotherapy (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella®) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance in PCD patients.

33005176	"Ultrastructural Sperm Flagellum Defects in a Patient With CCDC39  Compound Heterozygous Mutations and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia/Situs Viscerum Inversus 
"	"Introduction: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by structural or functional motile cilia abnormalities. Up to 40 different genes seem, at the moment, to be involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. A number of ultrastructural defects have also been reported in sperm flagella, but the sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) has never been described in these cases. Aim: The aim of this study was to report the sperm MMP and ultrastructural abnormalities of the sperm flagella found in a patient with PCD and situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome) and its characterization from the genetic point of view. Methods: Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to evaluate flagella ultrastructure. The genetic testing was performed by next-generation sequencing. Sperm DNA fragmentation and MMP were also evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: We report here the case of an 18-year-old male patient with PCD and situs inversus and severe oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. TEM analysis of his spermatozoa showed an abnormal connecting piece. The mid piece appeared abnormally thickened, with cytoplasmic residue, dysplasia of fibrous sheath, loss of the outer dynein arms (ODAs), truncated inner dynein arms, and supernumerary outer fibers. The percentage of spermatozoa with fragmented DNA was normal, whereas a high percentage of spermatozoa had low MMP, suggesting an altered mitochondrial function. The genetic analysis showed the presence of c.610-2A > G, p.Arg811Cys compound heterozygous mutations in the CCDC39 gene. Conclusion: The case herein reported suggests that the high percentage of sperm with low MMP may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthenozoospermia in patients with Kartagener syndrome. In addition, we report, for the first time, the missense variant p.Arg811Cys in the CCDC39 gene in a patient with Kartagener syndrome. Although in silico analysis predicts its damaging potential, its clinical meaning remains unclear.

"	"To aid in the diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and to evaluate the respiratory epithelium in respiratory disease, normal age-related reference ranges are needed for ciliary beat frequency (CBF), beat pattern and ultrastructure. Our aim was to establish reference ranges for healthy Chinese children. Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 135 healthy Chinese children aged below 18 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. CBF and beat pattern were analysed from high speed video recordings. Epithelial integrity and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed using transmission electronic microscopy. The mean CBF from 135 children studied was 10.1 Hz (95% CI 9.8 to 10.4). Approximately 20% (ranged 18.0-24.2%) of ciliated epithelial edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. Normal beat pattern was observed in ciliated epithelium from all subjects. We did not find any effect of exposure to second hand smoke on CBF in our subjects. Microtubular defects were found in 9.3% of all of the cilia counted in these children, while other ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 3%. We established the reference range for CBF, beat pattern and ultrastructure in healthy Chinese children. Using similar methodology, we found a lower overall mean CBF than previously obtained European values. This study highlights the need to establish normative data for ciliary function in different populations.

33118031	"Molecular genetics of infertility: loss-of-function mutations in humans and corresponding knockout/mutated mice
"	"Infertility is a major issue in human reproductive health, affecting an estimated 15% of couples worldwide. Infertility can result from disorders of sex development (DSD) or from reproductive endocrine disorders (REDs) with onset in infancy, early childhood or adolescence. Male infertility, accounting for roughly half of all infertility cases, generally manifests as decreased sperm count (azoospermia or oligozoospermia), attenuated sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) or a higher proportion of morphologically abnormal sperm (teratozoospermia). Female infertility can be divided into several classical types, including, but not limited to, oocyte maturation arrest, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest. An estimated one half of infertility cases have a genetic component; however, most genetic causes of human infertility are currently uncharacterized. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has greatly facilitated the identification of infertility-associated gene mutations in patients over the past 20 years. This review aims to conduct a narrative review of the genetic causes of human infertility. Loss-of-function mutation discoveries related to human infertility are summarized and further illustrated in tables. Corresponding knockout/mutated animal models of causative genes for infertility are also introduced. A search of the PubMed database was performed to identify relevant studies published in English. The term 'mutation' was combined with a range of search terms related to the core focus of the review: infertility, DSD, REDs, azoospermia or oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), globozoospermia, teratozoospermia, acrosome, oocyte maturation arrest, POI, zona pellucida, fertilization defects and early embryonic arrest. Our search generated ∼2000 records. Overall, 350 articles were included in the final review. For genetic investigation of human infertility, the traditional candidate gene approach is proceeding slowly, whereas high-throughput sequencing technologies in larger cohorts of individuals is identifying an increasing number of causative genes linked to human infertility. This review provides a wide panel of gene mutations in several typical forms of human infertility, including DSD, REDs, male infertility (oligozoospermia, MMAF, PCD, ASS and globozoospermia) and female infertility (oocyte maturation arrest, POI, fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest). The causative genes, their identified mutations, mutation rate, studied population and their corresponding knockout/mutated mice of non-obstructive azoospermia, MMAF, ASS, globozoospermia, oocyte maturation arrest, POI, fertilization failure and early embryonic arrest are further illustrated by tables. In this review, we suggest that (i) our current knowledge of infertility is largely obtained from knockout mouse models; (ii) larger cohorts of clinical cases with distinct clinical characteristics need to be recruited in future studies; (iii) the whole picture of genetic causes of human infertility relies on both the identification of more mutations for distinct types of infertility and the integration of known mutation information; (iv) knockout/mutated animal models are needed to show whether the phenotypes of genetically altered animals are consistent with findings in human infertile patients carrying a deleterious mutation of the homologous gene; and (v) the molecular mechanisms underlying human infertility caused by pathogenic mutations are largely unclear in most current studies. It is important to use our current understanding to identify avenues and priorities for future research in the field of genetic causes of infertility as well as to apply mutation knowledge to risk prediction, genetic diagnosis and potential treatment for human infertility.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder caused by defects in motile cilia. The hallmark features of PCD are the chronic infections of the respiratory tract, moreover, clinical manifestations include also laterality defects and risk of male infertility. Clinical phenotypes of PCD are the result of mutations in genes encoding components of axonema or factors involved in axonemal assembly. Recent studies have identified over 45 PCD-associated genes, therefore, molecular analysis represents a powerful diagnostic tool to confirm and uncover new genetic causes of this rare disease. Here, we describe a female infant of Moroccan origin with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in addition to most common PCD symptoms. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular tests, such as a Next generation Sequencing panel and a custom array CGH, were performed for diagnosis of PCD. TEM revealed outer dynein arm (ODA) defects, whilst molecular analyses detected a novel 6,9 kb microdeletion in DNAI2 gene. Since DNAI2 mutations are very rare, this case report contributes to better delineate the important role of DNAI2 as causative of PCD phenotype, suggesting, furthermore, that the variations in DNAI2 may be as a new genetic risk factor for NPH. Indeed, although the association of hydrocephalus with PCD has been well documented, however, only a small number of human patients show this defect. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of high-throughput technologies in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous genetic disorders.

"	"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic motile ciliopathy, leading to significant otosinopulmonary disease. PCD diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to challenges with different diagnostic modalities. Ciliary videomicroscopy, using Digital High-Speed Videomicroscopy (DHSV), one of the diagnostic tools for PCD, is considered the optimal method to perform ciliary functional analysis (CFA), comprising of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and beat pattern (CBP) analysis. However, DHSV lacks standardized, published operating procedure for processing and analyzing samples. It also uses living respiratory epithelium, a significant infection control issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. To continue providing a diagnostic service during this health crisis, the ciliary videomicroscopy protocol has been adapted to include adequate infection control measures. Here, we describe a revised protocol for sampling and laboratory processing of ciliated respiratory samples, highlighting adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control measures. Representative results of CFA from nasal brushing samples obtained from 16 healthy subjects, processed and analyzed according to this protocol, are described. We also illustrate the importance of obtaining and processing optimal quality epithelial ciliated strips, as samples not meeting quality selection criteria do now allow for CFA, potentially decreasing the diagnostic reliability and the efficiency of this technique.

"	"Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of nasal epithelial cells is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and research of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Ex vivo samples often display secondary dyskinesia from cell damage during sampling, infection or inflammation confounding PCD diagnostic results. ALI culture enables regeneration of healthy cilia facilitating differentiation of primary from secondary ciliary dyskinesia. We describe a revised ALI culture method adopted from April 2018 across three collaborating PCD diagnostic sites, including current University Hospital Southampton COVID-19 risk mitigation measures, and present results. Two hundred and forty nasal epithelial cell samples were seeded for ALI culture and 199 (82.9%) were ciliated. Fifty-four of 83 (63.9%) ex vivo samples which were originally equivocal or insufficient provided diagnostic information following in vitro culture. Surplus basal epithelial cells from 181 nasal brushing samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen; 39 samples were ALI-cultured after cryostorage and all ciliated. The ciliary beat patterns of ex vivo samples (by high-speed video microscopy) were recapitulated, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated excellent ciliation, and cilia could be immuno-fluorescently labelled (anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-RSPH4a) in representative cases that were ALI-cultured after cryostorage. In summary, our ALI culture protocol provides high ciliation rates across three centres, minimising patient recall for repeat brushing biopsies and improving diagnostic certainty. Cryostorage of surplus diagnostic samples was successful, facilitating PCD research.

Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for severe localized bronchiectasis (2014-2019) via thoracoscopic versus robotic lobectomy. Four 5 mm ports were used for thoracoscopy; a four-arm approach was used for robotic surgery (Da Vinci Surgical Xi System, Intuitive Surgical, California). Eighteen children were operated (robotic resection, n = 7; thoracoscopy, n = 11) with infected congenital pulmonary malformation, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and post-viral infection. There were no conversions to open surgery with robotic surgery, but five with thoracoscopy. Total operative time was significantly longer with robotic versus thoracoscopic surgery (mean 247 ± 50 versus 152 ± 57 min, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, length of thoracic drainage, or total length of stay (mean 7 ± 2 versus 8 ± 3 days, respectively). No blood transfusions were required. Two thoracoscopic patients had a type-3 postoperative complication. Pediatric robotic lung lobectomy is feasible and safe, with excellent visualization and bi-manual hand-wrist dissection - useful properties in difficult cases of infectious pathologies.

"	"Cilia are highly conserved in most eukaryotes and are regarded as an important organelle for motility and sensation in various species. Cilia are microscopic, hair-like cytoskeletal structures that protrude from the cell surface. The major focus in studies of cilia has been concentrated on the ciliary dysfunction in vertebrates that causes multisymptomatic diseases, which together are referred to as ciliopathies. To date, the understanding of ciliopathies has largely depended on the study of ciliary structure and function in different animal models. Zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10) is a ciliary protein that was recently found to be mutated in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In Paramecium tetraurelia, we identified two ZMYND10 genes, arising from a whole-genome duplication. Using RNAi, we found that the depletion of ZMYND10 in P. tetraurelia causes severe ciliary defects, thus provoking swimming dysfunction and lethality. Moreover, we found that the absence of ZMYND10 caused the abnormal localization of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT43 along cilia. These results suggest that ZMYND10 is involved in the regulation of ciliary function and IFT, which may contribute to the study of PCD pathogenesis.

"	"The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) relies on clinical features and sophisticated studies. The detection of bi-allelic disease-causing variants confirms the diagnosis. However, a standardised genetic panel is not widely available and new disease-causing genes are continuously identified. To assess the accuracy of untargeted whole-exome sequencing (WES) as a diagnostic tool for PCD, patients with symptoms highly suggestive of PCD were consecutively included. Patients underwent measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels, ciliary transmission electron microscopy analysis (TEM) and WES. A confirmed PCD diagnosis in symptomatic patients was defined as a recognised ciliary ultrastructural defect on TEM and/or two pathogenic variants in a known PCD-causing gene. Forty-eight patients (46% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 10.0 years (range 1.0-37 years). In 36 patients (75%) a diagnosis of PCD was confirmed, of which 14 (39%) patients had normal TEM. A standalone untargeted WES had a diagnostic yield of 94%, identifying bi-allelic variants in 11 known PCD-causing genes in 34 subjects. A nNO<77 nL·min was nonspecific when including patients younger than 5 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.90). Consecutive WES considerably improved the diagnostic accuracy of nNO in young children (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1). Finally, WES established an alternative diagnosis in four patients. In patients with clinically suspected PCD and low nNO levels, WES is a simple, beneficial and accurate next step to confirm the diagnosis of PCD or suggest an alternative diagnosis, especially in preschool-aged children in whom nNO is less specific.

We present a patient with classical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) who was identified to have compound heterozygous variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.10691 + 2T > C, c.13523_13543dup21) via trio whole-exome sequencing in 2013. These variants were originally classified as Mutation and Likely Mutation. However, these variants were downgraded to variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) during reanalysis in 2016 because of uncertainty that they caused a loss of function of the gene. c.10691 + 2T > C is predicted to abrogate the canonical splice site and lead to the skipping of exon 65, but the adjoining of exon 64 and exon 66 in the DNAH11 transcript preserves the reading frame of the resultant protein. c.13523_13543dup21 is located in the last exon of the DNAH11 coding sequence, upstream of the canonical stop codon, which suggests a reduced likelihood to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Transcriptional analysis was performed to characterize the impact of the variants, resulting in reclassification of c.10691 + 2T > C to Likely Pathogenic by providing evidence that it results in a deleterious effect and subsequent downstream reclassification of c.13523\_13543dup21 to Likely Pathogenic as well. Our case illustrates the potential impact of transcriptional analysis on variant resolution, supporting its usage on variants that exert an unpredictable effect on splicing.

33635012	"Genetic Analysis of Korean Adult Patients with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Suspected of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Using Whole Exome Sequencing.
"	"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is ubiquitous in the environment, but NTM lung disease (NTM-LD) is uncommon. Since exposure to NTM is inevitable, patients who develop NTM-LD are likely to have specific susceptibility factors, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia and is characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection, organ laterality defect, and infertility. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and investigated the genetic characteristics of adult NTM patients with suspected PCD. WES was performed in 13 NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD by clinical symptoms and/or ultrastructural ciliary defect observed by transmission electron microscopy. A total of 45 PCD-causing genes, 23 PCD-candidate genes, and 990 ciliome genes were analyzed. Four patients were found to have biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the following PCD-causing genes: CCDC114, DNAH5, HYDIN, and NME5. In four other patients, only one LoF variant was identified, while the remaining five patients did not have any LoF variants. At least 30.8% of NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD had biallelic LoF variants, and an additional 30.8% of patients had one LoF variant. Therefore, PCD should be considered in patients with NTM-LD with symptoms or signs suspicious of PCD.

33635866	"Defects in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms cause morphological abnormalities and dysmotility in sperm cells leading to male infertility.
"	"Axonemal protein complexes, such as outer (ODA) and inner (IDA) dynein arms, are responsible for the generation and regulation of flagellar and ciliary beating. Studies in various ciliated model organisms have shown that axonemal dynein arms are first assembled in the cell cytoplasm and then delivered into axonemes during ciliogenesis. In humans, mutations in genes encoding for factors involved in this process cause structural and functional defects of motile cilia in various organs such as the airways and result in the hereditary disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite extensive knowledge about the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms in respiratory cilia, this process is still poorly understood in sperm flagella. To better define its clinical relevance on sperm structure and function, and thus male fertility, further investigations are required. Here we report the fertility status in different axonemal dynein preassembly mutant males (DNAAF2/ KTU, DNAAF4/ DYX1C1, DNAAF6/ PIH1D3, DNAAF7/ZMYND10, CFAP300/C11orf70 and LRRC6). Besides andrological examinations, we functionally and structurally analyzed sperm flagella of affected individuals by high-speed video- and transmission electron microscopy as well as systematically compared the composition of dynein arms in sperm flagella and respiratory cilia by immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, we analyzed the flagellar length in dynein preassembly mutant sperm. We found that the process of axonemal dynein preassembly is also critical in sperm, by identifying defects of ODAs and IDAs in dysmotile sperm of these individuals. Interestingly, these mutant sperm consistently show a complete loss of ODAs, while some respiratory cilia from the same individual can retain ODAs in the proximal ciliary compartment. This agrees with reports of solely one distinct ODA type in sperm, compared to two different ODA types in proximal and distal respiratory ciliary axonemes. Consistent with observations in model organisms, we also determined a significant reduction of sperm flagellar length in these individuals. These findings are relevant to subsequent studies on the function and composition of sperm flagella in PCD patients and non-syndromic infertile males. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the fertility status in PCD-affected males and should help guide genetic and andrological counselling for affected males and their families.

Herein, we presented a very rare case of a crazy-paving pattern as a radiological manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia was ultimately confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy, fungus culture, whole exome sequencing of blood, etc. The patient received flucytosine (PO, 5 g per day) and amphotericin B (IV, 70 mg per day) during hospitalization and sequential therapy with voriconazole (PO, 200 mg twice a day) after discharge. He recovered during follow-up. We concluded that pulmonary cryptococcosis should be considered a possible cause of crazy-paving patterns in chest CT scans.

33719352	"Case Report: Identification of a Novel ODAD3 Variant in a Patient With Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.
"	"Background:ODAD3 encodes a protein of 595 amino acids and contain three highly conserved coiled-coil domains, which is essential for cilia axoneme dynein arm assembly and docking. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) of ODAD3 deficiency are rarely reported. Female infertility in PCD related to ODAD3 variants has not been reported. Methods: Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the disease-related gene of the patient with PCD in a consanguineous Chinese family. Domain analysis was applied to predict the impact of the variant on ODAD3 protein. Results: The 35 year-old female patient exhibited chronic sinusitis, diffuse bronchiectasis, dextrocardia and infertility. We identified a novel homozygous variant in ODAD3, c.1166\_1169dupAGAC, p.(Leu391Aspfs\*105) in the PCD patient by exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. This frameshift variant was predicted to be disease causing by bioinformatics analysis and was also not presented in the current authorized large genetic databases. Conclusions: Our study enriches the genetic spectrum and clinical phenotypes of ODAD3 variants in PCD and provide more evidence for future genetic counseling and gene-targeted therapy for this disease.

"	"Arteriovenous malformations may lead to right-heart failure in cases of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two rare AV-malformations with left-to-right shunting and progressive right-heart failure in a single individual.

20414677	"Update on molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disease hallmarked by the development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Germline mutations in two genes, endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ACVRL1), have been implicated in this disease. This report describes molecular diagnosis in a consecutive series of 600 individuals with clinical features of HHT disease. Each coding exon and flanking intronic regions of ENG and ACVRL1 genes was sequenced. Exonic copy number was quantified in probands without a coding sequence mutation. Novel nonsynonymous variants were further analyzed to predict functional consequences. In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and haplotypes for the two genes were compared between individuals with and without mutations. The highest mutation detection rate (87% [95% CI 80.2-91.5]) was observed in probands who met all four Curacao criteria (epistaxis, telangiectases, AVMs and family history). More than 30% of identified mutations were novel; however, only 6% were variants of unknown significance. Determining the significance of novel mutations as related to disease presents additional challenges. Detection of multiple alterations in the same proband also requires careful evaluation for disease association. In conclusion, the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands in this group do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of these two genes. This suggests alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation or involvement of alternate loci, and it requires further investigation.

A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of **headache** for 2 months before **acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever.** CT-scan and **MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion.** **A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved.** CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after **coil embolization.** He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A **second embolization** was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke.

The incidence of these lesions and their outcomes are still largely unknown. **This study aims to determine the incidence of different primary lung tumors in children and to contribute data leading to the development of evidence-based treatment models. **A single institution retrospective **review** was performed with institutional review board approval. Patients were included if they had primary, nonhematologic lung tumors. Simple squamous papillomas subjected to endoscopic biopsy and not resected, and vascular lesions associated with multisystem lesions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, were excluded. Medical records and pathologic material for patients from 1918 to 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients were identified (23 boys, 17 girls) with a mean age of 9.6 years (range, 3 months to 19 years). Fourteen distinct** histopathologic tumor** types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. **Chemotherapy** was used in 23% (9) and **radiation** in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disease characterized by teleangiectasias involving virtually every organ. There are limited data in the literature regarding the natural history of liver vascular malformations in hemorrhagic telangiectasia and their associated morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study sought to assess the outcome of liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients. We analyzed 16 years of surveillance data from a tertiary hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center in Italy. We considered for inclusion in this study 502 consecutive Italian patients at risk of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who presented at the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center and underwent a multidisciplinary screening protocol for the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Of the 502 individuals assessed in the center, 154 had hepatic vascular malformations and were the subject of the study; 198 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and without hepatic vascular malformations were the controls. Additionally, we report the response to treatment of patients with complicated hepatic vascular malformations. The 154 patients were included and followed for a median period of 44 months (range 12-181); of these, eight (5.2%) died from VM-related complications and 39 (25.3%) experienced complications. The average incidence rates of death and complications were 1.1 and 3.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. The median overall survival and event-free survival after diagnosis were 175 and 90 months, respectively. The rate of complete response to therapy was 63%. This study shows that substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with liver vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients.

"	"Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are at risk for multiple complications and require close follow-up. We investigated the reproducibility of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and exercise stress test (EST) for the evaluation of low oxygen saturation in patients with PAVMs. Twenty-two patients with PAVMs, most of whom had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), participated in a Human Investigations Committee-approved protocol. Patients ranged from 9 to 74 years of age (mean 28) and had a broad spectrum of anatomic subtypes of PAVMs, including focal and diffuse. Standard 6MWT and cycle ergometry EST were both performed twice with adequate rest between tests. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were measured at the beginning and end of each test. Distance walked and maximum resistance was also recorded. The intraclass correlation coefficients (r(i)) at the end of 6MWT were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.940; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.973; 95% CI 0.933-0.989), and distance (r(i) = 0.942; 95% CI 0.867-0.975). The r(i)s at the end of EST were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.865-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.993; 95% CI 0.982-0.997), and maximum resistance (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.864-0.975). 6MWT and EST were reproducible measures of exercise capacity and oxygen saturation and are potential adjunct tests in the follow-up assessment for patients with PAVMs.

In 32 successive patients presenting with recurrent HHT epistaxis 25-100 mg of Bevacizumab was applied intranasally either as a submucosal injection or as a topical spray between November 2008 and May 2010. In many of the injected patients, the Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment efficacy. All 32 treated patients were contacted with pre- and posttreatment epistaxis severity scores (ESS) compared. Seventeen patients received topical Bevacizumab, 10 patients received a submucosal injection, and 5 patients received both. In addition, 12 patients were also treated with the KTP laser at the time of their submucosal injection. In the pretreatment period the average ESS was 7.0 (SD = 2.1), whereas in the posttreatment group the average ESS was 2.9 (SD = 1.7). This represents a significant improvement in epistaxis severity (P < .0001). In HHT patients intranasal Bevacizumab, applied as a topical spray or a submucosal injection, significantly improves epistaxis as measured by the Epistaxis Severity Score.

Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%). Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh. Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular development resulting in direct connections between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing capillaries. Symptoms and signs can appear throughout life and marked intrafamilial variability confounds diagnosis based purely on clinical criteria. We set out to determine the impact of genetic testing on the cost of screening for HHT in at-risk relatives. We performed economic modeling of idealized pedigrees following two scenarios: repeated clinical screening until an HHT diagnosis could be either affirmed or excluded, and mutation testing in the proband, followed by genetic testing of at-risk relatives and clinical monitoring of only those relatives who test positive for the familial mutation. Based on actual reimbursement data from our region's largest health insurer, the molecular diagnostic model saved over $22,000 for a family with four relatives at risk for the initial diagnostic work-up. For a cohort of 100 probands, the total savings for the molecular diagnostic model over a reasonable period of follow-up was greater than $9 million. In this idealized setting in which all probands and at-risk relatives accepted molecular testing, the economic advantages of genetic screening over repeated clinical screening are substantial.

A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. **We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. **Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. **The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years. A genetic study revealed a mutation in exon 3 of ALK1 (c.199C > T; p.Arg67Trp) in the proband and his eldest son presenting epistaxis.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The triggers that promote the development of PAH in HHT remain poorly understood. We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with decompensated right-sided heart failure secondary to newly diagnosed PAH. The clinical diagnosis of HHT was confirmed on the basis of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple typical mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. There was also a suggestive family history. The patient was discovered to have active and extensive stimulant abuse in addition to HHT. We concluded that there may be a temporal relationship between exposure to stimulants and development of PAH in a host with underlying gene mutation. This case highlights the paradigm of PAH development after environmental exposure in a genetically susceptible host.

"	"A 42-year-old woman was referred with a bleeding in the upper gastrointestin**al tract, varices in the fundus of the stomach and portal hypertension of unknown primary. Ultrasound examinations showed splenomegaly as well as portal hypertension. Blood examinations revealed low levels of haemoglobin**. CT imaging showed multiple arteriovenous malformations with arterioportal shunts within the liver which led to a volume-induced portal hypertension. The genetic analysis revealed no mutations in the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 or endoglin genes. The patient was clinically diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Because of the multiple arterioportal shunts within the liver and the resulting portal hypertension with live-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, the only therapeutic option for the patient is liver transplantation. Therefore, an application for a standard exception was made at Eurotransplant and the patient is going to be liver transplantated within the next months. Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease which leads to arteriovenous malformations and which can affect different organ systems. The course of the disease can be rather benign, but it can also lead to live-threatening complications requiring fast interventions.

"	"A 38-year-old woman who suffered from migraine was admitted because of severe, worsening headache for 24 hours (dissimilar to the previous migraine attacks), with impaired vision and weakness of the right arm. Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded. Physicians should search for cutaneous or mucous teleangiectasias. Family screening and long-term follow-up according to international guidelines is recommended.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with a wide spectrum of vascular malformations (VMs) involving multiple organs. Nine to 16% of patients with HHT harbor brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can cause intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective was to study clinical manifestations of brain AVMs in patients with HHT and correlate these with the specific gene mutated. We reviewed records of 171 patients with HHT and brain AVMs. A history of ICH was found in 27% (41/152) patients, with a mean age of 26 ± 18 range, (0-68) years. All of patients with ICH were neurologically asymptomatic prior to ICH. Multiple brain AVMs were found in 23% (170/39) of patients on initial examination. Genetic test results were available in 109 (64%) patients. Mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 were present in 75 (69%), 18 (17%), and 2 (2%), respectively. A history of ICH was reported in 24% of patients with an ENG mutation and 27% of patients with an ACVRL1 mutation, with a mean age of 26 ± 16 (range, 2-50) and 18 ± 21 (0-48) years, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age at first brain AVM diagnosis, prevalence of ICH history, age at ICH, or other manifestations of brain AVMs were observed among gene groups. In conclusion, no evidence for differences in brain AVM characteristics was observed among HHT gene groups, although we cannot exclude clinically important differences. Larger studies are needed to further guide brain AVM screening decisions in patients with HHT.

Three out of four criteria are required for a definite clinical diagnosis HHT, two criteria are considered ""possible"" HHT, and 0 or 1 criterion makes the diagnosis unlikely. However, these consensus diagnostic criteria have not been validated. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical criteria. A total of 450 consecutive persons ≥16 years of age were screened for HHT between May 2004 and September 2009, including a chest CT to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We selected 263 first-degree relatives of disease-causing mutation carriers who underwent mutation analysis. Genetic test results were considered the gold standard. The family mutation was present in 186 patients (mean age 42.9 ± 14.6 yr; 54.8% female). A clinical diagnosis was definite, ""possible"", and unlikely in 168 (90.3%), 17 (9.1%), and 1 (0.5%) patient, respectively. In 77 persons the family mutation was absent (mean age 37.1 ± 12.3 yr, 59.7% female).

The positive predictive value of a definite clinical diagnosis was 100% (95% CI 97.8-100), the negative predictive value of an unlikely diagnosis 97.7% (95% CI 87.9-99.6). Of 52 patients with ""possible"" HHT, 17 (32.7%) displayed an HHT-causing mutation. The Curaçao clinical criteria have a good diagnostic performance.

"	"Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

COX2 may be at the origin of a cascade of pro inflammatory events to favour angiogenesis and PAVM development. HHT and hepatopulmonary syndrome mouse models may be used to show its effects on PAVM formation. Anti COX-2 therapy could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a hepatopulmonary syndrome or HHT with small PAVM. PAVMs are one of the main causes of morbidity in patients presenting with HHT disease, owing to the risks of rupture as well as paradoxical embolism exposing to stroke and/or cerebral abscess. Percutaneous embolization has become the treatment of choice of PAVM. Anti COX2 may prevent from PAVM development and subsequent related complications and avoid either surgery and/or percutaneous embolization and thus subsequent related complication.

Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype.

The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGFβ pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGFβ signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations.

We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations. The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are reportedly at a lower overall risk of malignancies, and small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) arising in a HHT patient is extremely rare. In this study, the case of a 37-year-old female with HHT who developed a poorly differentiated jejunal adenocarcinoma five years after ileocecal resection for multiple colonic adenomas is presented. The patient underwent curative resection of the cancer invading the ileum and the mesentery of the transverse colon, but had to overcome critical complications perioperatively, stemming from HHT-associated peripheral capillary dilatation and arteriovenous malformation, including nosebleeds and possible infusion-induced air embolism through pulmonary shunts. The patient subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy including capecitabine and oxaliplatin for 6 months, and currently remains alive without any evidence of recurrence 12 months after the second surgery. This patient with SBA was an instructive case demonstrating the necessity of careful attention during major surgery in HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with a wide range of neurovascular abnormalities. The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.

27027094	"Implications of an Incidental Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation
"	"Introduction. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have been associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34-year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance. He underwent a pulmonary arteriography of the right upper and lower lobe with the use of a microcatheter system; however, the PAVM could not be visualized. Thus, he was managed medically. The patient was educated on the need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and surveillance imaging. Discussion. Our case highlights the importance of obtaining a complete past medical and family history in young patients with a history of recurrent epistaxis to elicit features of HHT. The diagnosis can be made clinically and directly affects family members, who would otherwise not receive appropriate screening.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by vascular dysplasia. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case in the literature of definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia diagnosed in western Kenya, a resource-limited setting with limited treatment options. A 60-year-old black Kenyan woman was admitted 1 year ago to a hospital in western Kenya with an 11-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis. Her physical examination revealed that she had telangiectasias on the tongue and hard palate, severe pallor, and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe opacity. After a positive saline contrast echocardiography, she underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, which revealed a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and multiple hepatic arteriovenous malformations. Therefore, she fulfilled criteria for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was managed with nasal packing, tranexamic acid, oral ferrous sulfate, and blood transfusions, as other treatment options were unavailable in this setting. This rare case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates that it occurs in an African population and that diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings can be surmounted. Treatment options remain limited in these settings.

The diagnosis of HHT is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease, and the variety of clinical manifestations. The management of HHT includes systematic screening for visceral AVMs at regular intervals, preventive interventions to reduce the risk of complications, and symptomatic measures.

"	"The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"We present the case of a patient who came to our attention for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Echocardiography showed moderate diastolic overload of both ventricles with enhanced cardiac output without valvular disease or cardiac shunt that could account for this cardiomegaly. A subsequent abdominal echocardiographic exploration showed an angiomatous transformation of the liver due to diffuse lacunar enlargement of hepatic portal vein branches and arterial-venous shunts. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the echocardiographic findings. **The imaging findings coupled with cutaneous and nasopharyngeal lesions were suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the diagnosis was confirmed after the identification of a mutation in the ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12. **HHT is a rare but underestimated vascular disease that can affect different organs, in particular the liver, leading to organ failure requiring transplantation as occurred in our patient. Echocardiography is a useful imaging tool to exclude cardiac abnormalities as a cause of cardiomegaly and to guide the correct diagnosis of a peripheral origin of high cardiac output.

28267932	"Hemoglobin Is a Vital Determinant of Arterial Oxygen Content in Hypoxemic Patients with Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations
"	"PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.

However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%. The 3-month and 1-year mortality rates were 7.5% and 11.25%, respectively. There is an overrepresentation of HHT patients in a cohort of patients with CA, and HHT should be investigated as the cause of the CA if no other apparent cause can be identified.

Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members.

We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) is a group of rare genetic disorders with asymmetric overgrowth caused by somatic mosaic mutations in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that encompass a heterogeneous group of rare disorder that are associated with the appearance of overgrowth. CLOVES syndrome and Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome are PROS disease. Proteus syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome caused by a somatic activating mutation in AKT1. CLOVES, Klippel-Trénaunay and Proteus syndromes are associated with high risk of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomic dominant disorder characterized by the presence of arteriovenous malformations. New therapeutic strategies with bevacizumab and thalidomide have been employed with promising results.

31441079	"Laser-Assisted Control of Epistaxis in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: A Systematic Review.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

32503579	"Current HHT genetic overview in Spain and its phenotypic correlation: data from RiHHTa registry
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Disease-causing variants in endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) genes are detected in more than 90% of cases submitted to molecular diagnosis. We used data from the RiHHTa (Computerized Registry of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) registry to describe genetic variants and to assess their genotype-phenotype correlation among HHT patients in Spain. By May 2019, 215 patients were included in the RiHHTa registry with a mean age of 52.5 ± 16.5 years and 136 (63.3%) were women. Definitive HHT diagnosis defined by the Curaçao criteria were met by 172 (80%) patients. Among 113 patients with genetic test, 77 (68.1%) showed a genetic variant in ACVRL1 and 36 (31.8%) in ENG gene. The identified genetic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG genes and their clinical significance are provided. ACVRL1 mutations were more frequently nonsense (50%) while ENG mutations were more frequently, frameshift (39.1%). ENG patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36.9 vs 45.7 years) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (71.4% vs 24.4%) and cerebral AVMs (17.6% vs 2%) more often than patients with ACVRL1 variants. Patients with ACVRL1 variants had a higher cardiac index (2.62 vs 3.46), higher levels of hepatic functional blood tests, and anemia (28.5% vs 56.7%) more often than ENG patients. ACVRL1 variants are more frequent than ENG in Spain. ACVRL1 patients developed symptomatic liver disease and anemia more often than ENG patients. Compared to ACVRL1, those with ENG variants are younger at diagnosis and show pulmonary and cerebral AVMs more frequently.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

"	"Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia affects between 1/5000 and 1/8000 people. It is characterized by presence of recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. It is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant transmission inducing an endothelial cells hyper-proliferation. A 68-year-old women with Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome was referred for management of general impairment with confusional syndrome and hyperthermia. Various examinations have allowed us to conclude at diagnosis of brain abscess with ventriculitis probably favored by right-left shunt secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. **Evolution was favorable after antibiotic treatment and endovascular embolization**. In case of brain abscess without obvious promoting factor, don't forget to looking for a right-left shunt providing septic or aseptic emboli. Furthermore, diagnosis of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome should be considered presence of telangiectasias and/or epistaxis.

"	"BMPR2 mutation is the most common cause of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH), but rare in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 are the most common gene mutations reported in HPAH with HHT. We report a 11-year-old boy with a definite diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and suspected HHT with recurrent epistaxis. The results of gene detection showed that there was a nosense mutation in BMPR2. The results of gene detection of ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 were normal. Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension with suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Patient was treated with ambrisentan 2.5 mg qd. About a month later, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding and sudden convulsions. The patient's vital signs were stable after symptomatic treatment. After discharging from hospital, the patients continued to take ambrisentan. No epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding was found in one month of follow-up, but the symptoms of chest tightness were not significantly alleviated. BMPR2 with a nonsense mutation is more likely to cause HPAH with HHT and are more likely to be life-threatening.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of arteriovenous malformations. The arteriovenous shunts may result in high output heart failure, which predisposes to atrial dilatation and atrial fibrillation. Due to recurrent bleeding from epistaxis or the gastrointestinal tract, patients with HHT and atrial fibrillation are at high risk of bleeding if anticoagulated for stroke prevention. In this report, we present a case of a** 74-year-old woman with a history of HHT and atrial fibrillation who developed a large left atrial thrombus that initially was thought to represent an atrial myxoma. **The diagnosis was confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and **the patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus.** This case demonstrates the role of different imaging modalities in the assessment of left atrial masses and presents an opportunity to review the data on safety of anticoagulation in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular disease characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and prognosis. Dietary evaluation is relevant in HHT patients to provide adequate iron and nutrient intake. Additionally, different dietary items have been reported to precipitate epistaxis in this setting. **Our primary aim was to investigate the dietary habits of HHT patients through a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate the presence of precipitants and/or protective factors for epistaxis and the occurrence of possible dietary modifications. The secondary aims were to evaluate the nutritional intake of iron in HHT patients and the self-reported effect of iron treatments on epistaxis**. From April 2018 to October 2018, a 138-item FFQ was provided to HHT patients followed up at the HHT Referral Center of Crema Maggiore Hospital. The relationship between food items and epistaxis was ascertained on a separate form. Daily iron intake was calculated to establish the mean iron content of food items reported in the FFQ. One hundred forty-nine questionnaires were evaluated [72 females, median age 54 years (12-76). Overall, 26 (18%) patients reported dietary items that improved epistaxis (mostly blueberries and red fruits, green vegetables and legumes), while 38 (26%) reported some dietary items that exacerbated epistaxis (spices, chocolate, alcohol, strawberries and ginger). Dietary modifications were reported in up to 58% of cases. In HHT patients, the mean daily iron intake was 8.46 ± 2.78 mg, and no differences were observed in the iron intake of patients reporting a diet modification and those who did not. In the comprehensive management of HHT a healthy and balanced diet, with increased consumption of dietary items with a high iron content, should be encouraged.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) and Endoglin (ENG) are the principal genes whose mutations cause HHT. A multicenter study to investigate the correlation between genetic variations and clinical outcomes in Korean HHT patients has been lacking. Seventy-two members from 40 families suspected of HHT based on symptoms were genetically screened for pathogenic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG. Patients with genetically diagnosed HHT were also evaluated. In the HHT genetic screening, 42 patients from 24 of the 40 families had genetic variants that met the pathogenic criteria (pathogenic very strong, pathogenic strong, pathogenic moderate, or pathogenic supporting) based on ACMG Standards and Guidelines in either ENG or ACVRL1; 26 from 12 families (50%) in ENG, and 16 from 12 families (50%) in ACVRL1. The diagnostic screening of 42 genetically positive HHT patients based on the Curaçao criteria revealed that 24 patients (57%) were in the definite group, 17 patients (41%) were in the probable group, and 1 patient (2%) was in the unlikely group. Epistaxis was the most common clinical presentation (38/42, 90%), followed by visceral AVMs (24/42, 57%), and telangiectasia (21/42, 50%). Five patients (12%) did not have a family history of HHT clinical symptoms. Among patients having ACVRL1 or ENG genetic variants, only about half of them could be clinically diagnosed as definite HHT, suggesting that genetic screening is important to confirm the diagnosis.
