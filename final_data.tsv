19403253	"Hereditary hemorragic telangiectasia and hepatic abcess
"	"We report the case of a 27-year-old man presenting with a hepatic abscess and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The association between HHT and an infectious disease seemed to be induced by arteriovenous malformations and maybe also by a deficit of polymorphonuclear cells, a monocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis. This diagnosis should be suggested in case of serious infections in young patients. Prevention is based on screening for and destroying infection, antibioprophylaxis and embolization of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"Arteriovenous malformations may lead to right-heart failure in cases of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two rare AV-malformations with left-to-right shunting and progressive right-heart failure in a single individual.

20042635	"ALK5 phosphorylation of the endoglin cytoplasmic domain regulates Smad1/5/8 signaling and endothelial cell migration
"	"Endoglin, an endothelial cell-specific transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily coreceptor, has an essential role in angiogenesis. Endoglin-null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype due to defects in angiogenesis and mutations in endoglin result in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I. Increased endoglin expression in the proliferating endothelium of tumors has been correlated with metastasis, tumor grade and decreased survival. Although endoglin is thought to regulate TGF-beta superfamily signaling in endothelial cells through regulating the balance between two TGF-beta-responsive pathways, the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/Smad2/3 pathway and the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1/5/8 pathway, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis has not been defined. Here, we investigate the role of the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and its phosphorylation by ALK5 in regulating endoglin function in endothelial cells. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin is basally phosphorylated by ALK5, primarily on serines 646 and 649, in endothelial cells. Functionally, the loss of phosphorylation at serine 646 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to TGF-beta and endothelial cell migration, whereas loss of phosphorylation at both serines 646 and 649 resulted in a loss of endoglin-mediated inhibition of Smad1/5/8 signaling in response to bone morphogenetic protein-9. Taken together, these results support endoglin phosphorylation by ALK5 as an important mechanism for regulating TGF-beta superfamily signaling and migration in endothelial cells.

20042709	"Spontaneous adult-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to increased endothelial oxidative stress in a murine model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by telangiectases and internal arteriovenous malformations caused by mutations in certain elements of the TGF-beta receptor complex. In the case of HHT1 mutations in the endoglin gene are responsible, whereas mutations in the ALK1 gene (an activin receptor-like kinase 1), lead to HHT2. Another two loci found at chromosome 5 and chromosome 7, whose target genes remain unidentified, lead to types 3 and 4 of the disease, respectively. Mutations in the MADH4/SMAD4 gene, another member of the TGF-beta signalling pathway, lead to a combined syndrome of familial juvenile polyposis associated with HHT. In an attempt to identify some soluble components differentially expressed in the plasma of HHT patients, angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin concentrations were analyzed with standard quantitative sandwich ELISA. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin levels are reduced in plasma of HHT patients compared to control individuals, and a diagnostic algorithm for HHT based on these protein levels is proposed. Down-regulated protein levels of angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin in plasma represent novel HHT biomarkers that could be useful in the biochemical diagnosis of HHT facilitating the rapid identification of potential HHT patients.

Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided informed consent. Across 12 months, all consecutive adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT referred to our pluridisciplinary HHT center for evaluation were enrolled prospectively in the study and underwent contrast material-enhanced multidetector CT of the abdomen. Pancreatic telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas were noted, and their characteristics were described. Genetic mutation was also investigated. Thirty-five patients (19 women, 16 men; mean age, 48.4 years) were included. All patients were asymptomatic. A genetic mutation was identified in 28 (80%) patients, including endoglin in 16 (57%), activin type-II-like receptor kinase 1 (ALK1) in 11 (39%), and SMAD4 in one (4%). Eleven (31%) patients exhibited pancreatic involvement. Fifty-four percent of patients with ALK1 mutation had pancreatic involvement. Twenty-three pancreatic telangiectases were identified during the arterial phase in nine patients. Seven pancreatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified in four patients. Pancreatic involvement commonly is found in patients with HHT (31% in our study), mainly in patients with ALK1 mutation; pancreatic telangiectases or AVMs are only diagnosed duringthe arterial phase at multidetector CT.

"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often present with recurrent anemia because of epistaxis or GI bleeding in relation to telangiectases mostly located in the stomach or small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood. To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Prospective, descriptive study. Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007. This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy investigation. Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences. Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7%) and 26 (86.7%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7% of patients. Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation. This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.

20224041	"Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin
"	"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation. Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM. In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina. Endoglin-deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs. Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.

As alternative treatment modalities repeatedly failed and the patient became almost permanently dependent on nasal dressing, we performed a highly conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the nasal cavity; a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy single fractions was applied. The therapy was very well tolerated, no acute toxicities occurred. Two weeks after the last radiation dose had been applied, the nasal dressing could be removed without problems. Endoscopical control revealed an almost avascular white mucosa without any trace of bleeding spots; previously existing hemangiomas and crusts had disappeared. After a 1-year-follow up, the patient had no significant recurrent epistaxis.

"	"To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of transcatheter embolotherapy for treating sporadic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) that were not associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Between January 2001 and June 2008, thirty-five sporadic PAVMs were detected in 23 patients. The clinical follow up consisted of assessing the changes of the signs and symptoms of the PAVMs, and radiological evaluation with chest radiographs or chest CT scans. The lower lung regions (63%) and peripheral locations (86%) were the common locations of the PAVMs. Thirty-four PAVMs (97%) had simple architecture (one arterial feeder within a single pulmonary segment). Technical success was achieved in 33 PAVMs (94%); two cases of technical failure were due to catheterization failure (n = 1) and too large a feeding artery (17 mm) that disabled embolotherapy (n = 1). Coils and Amplatz vascular plugs were used in 30 and three PAVMs, respectively. Inadvertent placement of one coil (n = 1) and pulmonary infarction (n = 1) occurred, but no relevant symptoms developed. For the 13 patients with available data, the mean arterial O(2) saturation changed significantly from 92% to 98%. Complete or near-complete involution of the sac was observed in 30 of the 33 embolized PAVMs (91%). In these 33 embolized PAVMs, the mean sac diameter significantly decreased from 17.83 mm to 0.68 mm. Sporadic PAVMs are mostly the simple type with predominance in the lower lobe and peripheral locations. Transcatheter embolotherapy with coils or Amplatz vascular plugs is a safe and effective treatment for sporadic PAVMs and this provides excellent functional and radiological improvement.

However, a substantial right to left shunt of 14% persisted. Pulmonary angiography revealed multiple arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) and she was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The AVMs were embolized and she has had no further cerebral events. Interestingly, her episodes of 'migraine' have also improved dramatically following the closure of the PFO and the embolization of the AVMs. This case demonstrates the complex relationship between right to left shunts, cryptogenic stroke and migraine.

20879701	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant vascular disease. The clinical manifestations are epistaxis, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. Patients show severe epistaxis, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life. There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency. No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies. We report the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression. The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after hepatic failure due to a liver arteriovenous malformation. The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection. After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external telangiectases, epistaxes, and anemia disappeared. Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and mRNA expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation.

This retrospective analysis summarized the clinical features of 6 patients with PAH associated with HHT hospitalized at department of cardiology in Cardiovascular Institute and Fuwai Hospital between January 2006 and May 2009. The mean age of the 6 patients (3 male) was 34 years (8 - 67 years). Recurrent epistaxis were present in all patients, there were 4 patients with severe PAH and 2 patients with moderate PAH. All of the six patients with PAH associated with HHT were misdiagnosed at the first hospital visit. Clinical symptoms were significantly improved in 4 patients and remained unchanged in 2 patients combined hepatic venous malformation post medical therapy. Misdiagnosis for patients with PAH associated with HHT is a common phenomenon in daily clinical practice. Patients could benefit from the corresponding medical therapy after the establishment of the correct diagnosis.

21484125	"Successful liver transplantation for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, a single centre experience
"	"BACKROUNDS/PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Weber-Osler is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasia that may affect the nose, skin, lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well. Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"Paradoxical embolism due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is the main mechanism of brain infarction in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. International Guidelines have recently been published to clarify the performance of screening tests and the effectiveness of treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We present two cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients of our hospital who experienced an acute stroke secondary to paradoxical embolism. These two cases show that the guidelines must be followed to prevent the occurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and that although they may be adequate in most cases, there are some patients who need a more personalized approach.

21764776	"ChIP-seq reveals cell type-specific binding patterns of BMP-specific Smads and a novel binding motif
"	"Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare systemic fibrovascular dysplasia also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. Epistaxis is often the first and foremost symptom of the disease and recurrent epistaxis is the main complaint. Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of endovascular treatment of epistaxis in HHT patients. Between June 2004 and January 2008, 14 patients with HHT underwent embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches due to severe epistaxis. There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) or embospheres in diameter of 500-700-µm were used as an embolic material. Embolization was technically successful in 11 (78.5%) patients. Immediate, complete control of bleeding was achieved in 12 (85%) patients. During long-term follow-up recurrent nasal bleeding occurred in six (43%) patients 6-24 months after treatment. There were no severe complications after embolization. Nine patients experienced mild facial pain which resolved within three days after the treatment. Three patients in whom arterial spasm was observed, suffered from facial paraesthesia lasting for 3-5 days after embolization. Out of 14 patients, 12 were available for 24-month follow-up evaluation. All except one claimed reduction in frequency and severity of epistaxis which had a positive impact on their quality of life. Endovascular embolization of epistaxis in patients with HHT is an effective and safe procedure although it cannot provide a long-term cure in most cases. Embolization reduces the frequency, severity and duration of nasal bleeding in patients with HHT, improving patients' quality of life.

"	"Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.

"	"Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.

This was a single-center study of children who underwent baseline screening for PAVMs using both TTCE and chest computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of HHT. The CT and TTCE results were prospectively reviewed independently by 2 radiologists and 2 cardiologists blinded to the study results. Both intraobserver and interobserver agreement for interpreting TTCE results were excellent (κ = 0.97 and 0.92, respectively) and higher than the interobserver agreement for CT interpretation (κ = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of TTCE to predict PAVMs were 1 and 0.82, respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 0.39 and 1, respectively. TTCE is a sensitive test for PAVMs in children with suspected HHT and can be a useful initial screening tool in pediatric HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. The patient was treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months. Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in mainly the endoglin gene (ENG) or activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) gene (ACVRL1). We investigated the molecular basis of HHT in a Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation in ENG (c.38T>A, p.Leu13Gln) located in the signal peptide's hydrophobic core, but not in ACVRL1. In experiments in COS-1 cells, the Leu13Gln (L13Q) mutant endoglin appeared to be expressed as a precursor form, probably due to impaired protein processing. Flow cytometry analyses of the COS-1 cells transiently expressing recombinant endoglins revealed that the wild-type endoglin was detected on the cell surface, but the L13Q mutant was not. We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.

22421041	"ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway
"	"Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

"	"ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.

"	"BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicate BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation.

23109496	"Management of severe epistaxis after Young's procedure: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting multiple organ systems, with epistaxis being the most common manifestation. Multiple procedures have been used for the management of epistaxis in the setting of HHT, including closure of the anterior nares via a Young's procedure. While this procedure results in loss of smell and permanent nasal obstruction, proponents note significant improvement in patient symptomatology. Case report. A 70-year-old female with a history of HHT presented to an outside hospital with bleeding into the nasopharynx 2 months after undergoing a modified Young's procedure at an unaffiliated institution. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and transferred to our facility. Due to persistent epistaxis and need for airway protection, the patient was intubated and her throat was packed. She also developed aspiration pneumonia and hypotensive shock requiring vasopressors. Twenty-four hours following bilateral internal maxillary and sphenopalatine artery embolization, she developed significant epistaxis requiring reversal of the Young's procedure on the left and placement of an anterior-posterior pack at the bedside. Upon packing removal several days later in the operating room, she was noted to have significant bleeding that necessitated reversal of the Young's procedure on the right side to obtain adequate exposure and hemostasis. We report a case of significant, life-threatening epistaxis following a modified Young's procedure that requiring multiple transfusions, bilateral embolization, and ultimately reversal of the Young's procedure for control of epistaxis. Although recognized as a potential complication, to our knowledge this is the first report in the English literature of such a case.

In a 37-year-old female patient, dynamic contrast-enhanced upper abdominal CT and MRI were performed. CT and MRI revealed dilated celiac trunk and hepatic artery. On early arterial phase, dilated hepatic veins showed significant enhancement. On arterial and portal venous phases, liver showed significantly heterogeneous contrast enhancement and showed homogenous enhancement in the hepatic parenchymal phase. On the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, irregular biliary ducts with strictures and dilatation were seen.

"	"Angiokeratomas are papular telangiectasias having a common histology of ectasia of the superficial dermal vessels surmounted by a hyperkeratotic epidermis. The patient was a 9-year-old girl born of non-consanguineous parents after a well-followed pregnancy with problem-free delivery at term. From birth, she had a tumefaction of the left side of the nose and the left half of the upper lip that gradually increased in size without obstructing the nasal orifice and bled easily. Examination revealed the presence of tumefaction of the left nostril and the left half of the upper lip projecting towards the contralateral side especially in the nose. It was soft and painless, with the presence at the surface of dull red keratotic papules of 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Examination of the nasal mucosa revealed the same appearance of papules. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare congenital malformation, the rarest of five types. Since its initial description in 1890, few cases have been reported. However, female predominance has been noted with a male/female sex ratio of 1/3. It appears to be due to a genetic mutation that is probably autosomal, but the site of which is still unknown. In view of the special features of this case, several diagnoses were suggested, including Rendu Osler's disease, superficial lymphangioma and verrucous angioma. The particularity of this case is that it includes the first description of this site, which posed a therapeutic problem, especially concerning the choice of laser type to be used.

"	"HHT patients with liver vascular malformations (VMs) may develop high-output cardiac failure requiring liver transplant in few cases. Our aim is to show that echocardiography is a good tool to evaluate the severity of hepatic vascular malformations in HHT and can improve medical management in HHT patients. The study is a cross-sectional study of cardiac parameters in HHT patients with dyspnea in a single referral center. All HHT patients with dyspnea, consecutively seen at HHT reference center in Lyon between May 2007 and November 2009 were included and had hepatic vascular Ultrasound and Echocardiography. Echocardiographic measures included cardiac output (CO) and index (CI), left ventricle (LV) filling pressures, and pulmonary artery pressure. Then, patients were classified in 4 groups according to the severity: group 1 (normal values), group 2 with isolated high CI, group 3 with high CI and increased LV-filling pressures and group 4 with increased LV-filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-two HHT-patients were analyzed. Eight patients were in group 1, 25 in group 2, 6 in group 3 and 13 in group 4. Age, NYHA class dyspnea, edema, atrial fibrillation, hepatic artery diameter, and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels significantly increased from groups 1 to 4 as well as left atrial area, and presence of mitral regurgitation. Patients with associated pulmonary VMs (n=11) did not show any clinical or echocardiographic differences. Performing echocardiography in HHT patients with dyspnea allowed us to better understand the physiological processes of high-CO failure complicating liver vascular malformations and may improve follow-up of patients and treatment decisions.

23320130	"Oxidative stress contributes to endothelial dysfunction in mouse models of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) or activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1; HHT2) genes, coding for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily receptors. We demonstrated previously that endoglin and ALK1 interact with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and affect its activation. Endothelial cells deficient in endoglin or ALK1 proteins show eNOS uncoupling, reduced NO, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we measured NO and H(2)O(2) levels in several organs of adult Eng and Alk1 heterozygous mice, to ascertain whether decreased NO and increased ROS production is a generalized manifestation of HHT. A significant reduction in NO and increase in ROS production were found in several organs, known to be affected in patients. ROS overproduction in mutant mice was attributed to eNOS, as it was L-NAME inhibitable. Mitochondrial ROS contribution, blocked by antimycin, was highest in liver while NADPH oxidase, inhibited by apocynin, was a major source of ROS in the other tissues. However, there was no difference in antimycin- and apocynin-inhibitable ROS production between mutant and control mice. Our results indicate that eNOS-derived ROS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and likely predisposes to disease manifestations in several organs of HHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1 account for around 85% of cases, and 10% are large deletions and duplications. Here we present a large novel deletion in ACVRL1 gene and its molecular characterization in a 3 generation Italian family. We employed short tandem repeats (STRs) analysis, direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, and 'deletion-specific' PCR methods. STRs Analysis at ENG and ACVRL1 loci suggested a positive linkage for ACVRL1. Direct sequencing of this gene did not identify any mutations, while MLPA identified a large deletion. These results were confirmed and exactly characterized with a 'deletion-specific' PCR: the deletion size is 4,594 bp and breakpoints in exon 3 and intron 8 show the presence of short direct repeats of 7 bp [GCCCCAC]. We hypothesize, as causative molecular mechanism, the replication slippage model. Understanding the fine mechanisms associated with genomic rearrangements may indicate the nonrandomness of these events, highlighting hot spots regions. The complete concordance among MLPA, STRs analysis and 'deletion-specific PCR' supports the usefulness of MLPA in HHT molecular analysis.

"	"When combined with local sphenopalatine (SP) injection and moderate hypotension, transoral or transcutaneous local injection of the anterior palatine (AP) vessels reduces intraoperative bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients undergoing nasal surgery. Retrospective chart review of 55 consecutive HHT patients undergoing a bevacizumab injection for recalcitrant epistaxis. Nineteen patients received local injections to only the SP vasculature, and 36 patients received AP and SP injections. Main outcome variable was estimated blood loss during nasal surgery. Independent variables included sex, age, epistaxis severity score, surgical techniques (including laser), and blood pressure parameters (baseline, preinduction, and postintubation). The mean blood loss in HHT patients receiving SP injections alone was 111 mL, whereas it was 22 mL for those receiving both AP + SP injections. This difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = .075). Blood pressure parameters were similar in both groups with no appreciable difference between intraoperative systolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The addition of either sublabial or transcutaneous AP injection to the standard SP block markedly reduces blood loss in HHT epistaxis nasal surgery.

23675457	"Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.

"	"Organs-on-chips are microengineered in vitro tissue structures that can be used as platforms for physiological and pathological research. They provide tissue-like microenvironments in which different cell types can be co-cultured in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ mimics. Blood vessels are an integral part of all tissues in the human body. Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of organs-on-chips since generated tissues will require a blood or nutrient supply. Here, we have engineered three-dimensional constructs of vascular tissue inside microchannels by injecting a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells) and rat tail collagen I into a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel with dimensions 500 μm × 120 μm × 1 cm (w × h × l). Over the course of 12 h, the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the channel. Detailed examination of tube morphology by confocal microscopy revealed a mature endothelial monolayer with complete PECAM-1 staining at cell-cell contacts and pericytes incorporated inside the tubular structures. We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for normal vascular development; deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and mutations in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic diseases. In the engineered microvessels, inhibition of TGF-β signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher tortuosity, highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). In summary, we have developed microengineered three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell types. In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue constructs to advance the development of organs-on-chips.

"	"The vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is in general an inherited disease caused by mutations in the TGF-β/BMP receptors endoglin or ALK1 or in rare cases by mutations of the TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad4 leading to the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT. HHT is characterized by several clinical symptoms like spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases at sites like lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose, and visceral lesions like gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations. The disease shows an inter- and intra-family variability in penetrance as well as symptoms from mild to life threatening. Penetrance is also depending on age. Diagnosis of the disease is based on the presence of some of the listed symptoms or by genetic testing. HHT diagnosis is laborious, time consuming, costly and sometimes uncertain. Not all typical symptoms may be present, especially at a younger age, and genetic testing does not always identify the disease causing mutation. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was investigated as a potential alternative to the current diagnostic methods. IR-spectra were obtained by Fourier-transform Mid-IR spectroscopy from blood plasma from HHT patients and a healthy control group. Spectral data were mathematically processed and subsequently classified and analysed by artificial neural network (ANN) analyses and by visual analysis of scatter plots of the dominant principal components. The analyses showed that for HHT a disease specific IR-spectrum exists that is significantly different from the control group. Furthermore, at the current stage with the here used methods, HHT can be diagnosed by Mid-IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%. Visual analysis of PCA scatter plots revealed an inter class variation of the HHT group. IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis can be considered to be a serious alternative diagnostic method compared to clinical and genetically based methods. Blood plasma is an ideal candidate for diagnostic purposes, it is inexpensive, easy to isolate and only minimal amounts are required. In addition, IR-spectroscopy measurement times are fast, less than one minute, and diagnosis is not based on interpretation of may be uncertain clinical data. And last but not least, the method is inexpensive.

24098321	"A genome-wide investigation of copy number variation in patients with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformation
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels, with shunting of blood from the arterial to venous circulation and a high risk of rupture and intracranial hemorrhage. Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM. A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM. We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis.

"	"Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

"	"To assess the safety and efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency (RF) treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with mild or moderate epistaxis. We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT), also known as the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a multiorganic vascular disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Diagnostic clinical criteria include: epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance. HHT is transmitted in 90% of the cases as an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in either endoglin (ENG), or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) genes (HHT type 1 and 2, respectively). We have carried out a genetic analysis of four independent Spanish families with HHT clinical criteria, which has permitted the identification of new large deletions in ENG. These mutations were first detected using the MLPA technique and subsequently, the deletion breakpoints were mapped using a customized copy number variation (CNV) microarray. The array was designed to cover the ENG gene and surrounding areas. All tested families carried large deletions ranging from 3-kb to 100-kb, involving the ENG gene promoter, several ENG exons, and the two downstream genes FGSH and CDK9. Interestingly, common breakpoints coincident with Alu repetitive sequences were found among these families. The systematic hybridization of DNA from HHT families, with deletions or duplications, to custom designed microarrays, could allow the mapping of breakpoints, coincident with repetitive Alu sequences that might act as ""hot spots"" in the development of chromosomal anomalies.

"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

24273414	"Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted. The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years. Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.

She was found to have atypical atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Radiofrequency ablation was planned, but inferior vena cava interruption precluded right atrial (RA) access. The RA was then accessed through both subclavian veins, and activation mapping revealed a dense atriotomy scar in the posterolateral inferior RA. Wavefront propagation proceeded caudally through an area of slow conduction confined by the atriotomy scar. Atypical atrial flutter terminated during a second radiofrequency application to an isthmus confined by 2 regions of dense scar. The arrhythmia did not recur, although the patient later experienced typical atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. High-output heart failure due to systemic arteriovenous shunt was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and improved markedly with bevacizumab therapy.

"	"To identify whether relationships exist between epistaxis and migraines in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), to potentially provide further preventative and therapeutic options for the debilitating nosebleeds that are often very difficult to manage in clinical practice. Study participants were recruited from a UK specialist service, and online following advertisement by the HHT Foundation International. They completed a nonbiased questionnaire in which paired questions on nosebleeds and migraines were separated by at least 17 other questions. Migraines were defined as headaches with associated autonomic and/or neurological features. The reported frequencies and precipitants of epistaxis and migraines were compared using numerical scales applied equally for each condition. The 220 HHT-affected respondents reported frequent nosebleeds, 153 (69.5%) used iron tablets, and 39 (17.7%) had received at least 10 blood transfusions. Migraines displaying typical features were reported by 51 (23.2%), and were more common with pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Thirty of 51 (58.8%) migraine sufferers reported that nosebleeds occurred at the same time as their migraines. More frequent migraines were reported by patients with more frequent nosebleeds (r2=15%, P=.007), or transfusions (r2=16.9%, P=.004). In menstrual, lifestyle, and dietary analyses, consistency was observed between factors having no effect, and those provoking both nosebleeds and migraines in multiple patients (premenses; activity; lack of sleep; stress; caffeine, cheese, alcohol, and chocolate). We demonstrate an unexpected and provocative association between nosebleeds and migraines in HHT patients. Evaluation of whether antimigraine approaches limit HHT nosebleeds may be appropriate. 4.

24489709	"ENDOGLIN is dispensable for vasculogenesis, but required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis
"	"ENDOGLIN (ENG) is a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members that is highly expressed in endothelial cells and has a critical function in the development of the vascular system. Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.

24520391	"Novel brain arteriovenous malformation mouse models for type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have a higher prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) than the general population and patients with other HHT subtypes. The pathogenesis of brain AVM in HHT1 patients is currently unknown and no specific medical therapy is available to treat patients. Proper animal models are crucial for identifying the underlying mechanisms for brain AVM development and for testing new therapies. However, creating HHT1 brain AVM models has been quite challenging because of difficulties related to deleting Eng-floxed sequence in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice. To create an HHT1 brain AVM mouse model, we used several Cre transgenic mouse lines to delete Eng in different cell-types in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice: R26CreER (all cell types after tamoxifen treatment), SM22α-Cre (smooth muscle and endothelial cell) and LysM-Cre (lysozyme M-positive macrophage). An adeno-associated viral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (AAV-VEGF) was injected into the brain to induce focal angiogenesis. We found that SM22α-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo caused AVMs in the postnatal brain, spinal cord, and intestines. Induction of Eng deletion in adult mice using R26CreER plus local VEGF stimulation induced the brain AVM phenotype. In both models, Eng-null endothelial cells were detected in the brain AVM lesions, and formed mosaicism with wildtype endothelial cells. However, LysM-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo did not cause AVM in the postnatal brain even after VEGF stimulation. In this study, we report two novel HHT1 brain AVM models that mimic many phenotypes of human brain AVM and can thus be used for studying brain AVM pathogenesis and testing new therapies. Further, our data indicate that macrophage Eng deletion is insufficient and that endothelial Eng homozygous deletion is required for HHT1 brain AVM development.

This study was designed to examine the function of CACs derived from patients with HHT. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients with HHT and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were assessed for expression of CD34, CD133 and VEGF receptor 2 by flow cytometry. PBMNCs were cultured to procure early outgrowth CACs. Development of endothelial cell (EC) phenotype in CACs was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. CAC apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V staining, and CAC migration assessed by a modified Boyden chamber assay. mRNA expression of endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVLR1 or ALK1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in CACs was measured by real time RT-PCR. The percentage of CD34+ cells in PBMNCs from HHT patients was significantly higher than in PBMNCs of healthy controls. CACs derived from patients with HHT not only showed a significant reduction in EC-selective surface markers following 7-day culture, but also a significant increase in the rate of basal apoptosis and blunted migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1. CACs from HHT patients expressed significantly lower levels of ENG, ALK1 and eNOS mRNAs. In conclusion, CACs from patients with HHT exhibited various functional impairments, suggesting a reduced regenerative capacity of CACs to repair the vascular lesions seen in HHT patients.

Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis.

To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.

The patient also had 3 polymorphisms in the TRPC6 gene (c.1-361A>T, c.1-254C>G, c.1-218C>T). The study of these genes will help us to identify and track individuals susceptible for developing PAH associated with other diseases.

"	"Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of fibrovascular tissues, characterized by a classic triad of mucocutaneous telangiectasias, recurrent hemorrhages, and a familial occurrence. Portosystemic encephalopathy in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is rare, but we experienced a case presenting with recurrent portosystemic encephalopathy in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. We report on a case of a 75-year-old female presenting with an altered mentality. Initial studies including brain imaging study did not reveal any specific cause for her mental status. She was diagnosed with the rare disease after a series of tests and received conservative treatment. Her neurological status recovered fully without complication after conservative treatment and she was discharged after 18 hospital days. This case demonstrated an extremely rare case of Osler-Weber-Rendu disease presenting as portosystemic encephalopathy treated successfully with conservative treatment. For patients who have shown hepatic encephalopathy without a definite cause, we recommend evaluation for the possibility of Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Conservative treatment based on treatment of advanced liver cirrhosis could be an alternative solution.

25815003	"Genetic variation in the functional ENG allele inherited from the non-affected parent associates with presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 (HHT1) and may influence expression of PTPN14
"	"HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by vascular malformations (VMs) and caused by mutations in TGFβ/BMP9 pathway genes, most commonly ENG or ACVRL1. Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype. These results suggest that common polymorphisms in HHT genes other than the mutated gene modulate phenotype severity of HHT disease, specifically presence of organ VM.

25862798	"Complications and mortality in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A population-based study
"	"Studies report that the risks of significant neurologic complications (including stroke, cerebral abscess, and migraine) and hemorrhagic sequelae are high in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), and that life expectancy in this cohort is reduced. However, most published cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias. We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also long-term survival of those with the disease. From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis (OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at death 3 years younger. Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is required.

25909848	"BMP9 Crosstalk with the Hippo Pathway Regulates Endothelial Cell Matricellular and Chemokine Responses
"	"Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder associated with pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), present in about 30-50% of patients. Dyspnea is frequently reported by about one-half of patients with PAVMs and has been related to the degree of right to left shunting. However, many HHT patients with PAVMs remain asymptomatic and those without PAVMs have been observed to have dyspnea, the cause of which has not been characterized. The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of dyspnea and its etiology in the HHT population. Retrospective review of over 1000 patients at an HHT Center of Excellence from 1997 to 2010. Patients were categorized as definite HHT if they met ≥3 clinical diagnostic criteria or had a positive genetic diagnosis. Patients were unlikely to have HHT (non-HHT) if they had 1 or fewer diagnostic criteria. Data on dyspnea prevalence (MMRC ≥ 1), PAVMs, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, symptomatic liver venous malformations, anemia and obesity was reviewed. 506 patients were categorized as having HHT, of which 202 (40%) had confirmed PAVMs. Dyspnea prevalence was 35% (178/506) vs. 18% (50/284, p < 0.0001) in the HHT and non-HHT patients, respectively. With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of dyspnea (MMRC ≥1) was 3.45 (95% CI 2.08-5.71) with the presence of PAVMs in HHT patients. Other independent predictors of dyspnea were older age, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, anemia, and obesity. Prevalence of dyspnea is significant, evident in about one-third of HHT patients, often associated with PAVMs. It is important to consider other etiologies for dyspnea when assessing patients with HHT.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may either rupture or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism causing stroke or cerebral abscess. Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.

We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

HHT is a hereditary condition with significant health consequences, but little is known about how individuals cope with HHT on a daily basis and how individuals share information about the disorder with social groups outside of the family. The objectives of this study were to improve understanding of the daily experiences of patients with diagnosed HHT and to investigate how they disclose their diagnosis to various social groups (friends, dating partners, employers, and coworkers) outside of their biological family. Adult patients seen at a university HHT clinic and who had been diagnosed with HHT for at least 6 months were recruited by mail. Participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 19). A qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts identified four major categories: (1) the emotional impact of HHT, (2) the social impact of HHT, (3) concerns for current and future health related to HHT, and (4) social context drives disclosure of HHT. Participants reported that although HHT was a manageable hereditary disorder, the symptoms negatively affected their daily life.

The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71.

However, when present, clinical manifestations can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Current expertise in the variable clinical manifestations and recommendations for diagnostic approach and management of hepatic involvement in HHT are outlined. A review of current literature was performed using the MEDLINE search string: ""Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL] AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL])"". Due to the lack of therapeutic consequence, systematic screening for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic patients with HHT is currently not recommended. In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established.

The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

"	"The circulatory system is walled off by different cell types, including vascular mural cells and podocytes. The interaction and interplay between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes, play a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is an RGD-containing counter-receptor for β1 integrins and is highly expressed by ECs during angiogenesis. We find that the adhesion between vascular ECs and mural cells is enhanced by integrin activators and inhibited upon suppression of membrane endoglin or β1-integrin, as well as by addition of soluble endoglin (SolEng), anti-integrin α5β1 antibody or an RGD peptide. Analysis of different endoglin mutants, allowed the mapping of the endoglin RGD motif as involved in the adhesion process. In Eng (+/-) mice, a model for hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia type 1, endoglin haploinsufficiency induces a pericyte-dependent increase in vascular permeability. Also, transgenic mice overexpressing SolEng, an animal model for preeclampsia, show podocyturia, suggesting that SolEng is responsible for podocytes detachment from glomerular capillaries. These results suggest a critical role for endoglin in integrin-mediated adhesion of mural cells and provide a better understanding on the mechanisms of vessel maturation in normal physiology as well as in pathologies such as preeclampsia or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.

"	"Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are reportedly at a lower overall risk of malignancies, and small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) arising in a HHT patient is extremely rare. In this study, the case of a 37-year-old female with HHT who developed a poorly differentiated jejunal adenocarcinoma five years after ileocecal resection for multiple colonic adenomas is presented. The patient underwent curative resection of the cancer invading the ileum and the mesentery of the transverse colon, but had to overcome critical complications perioperatively, stemming from HHT-associated peripheral capillary dilatation and arteriovenous malformation, including nosebleeds and possible infusion-induced air embolism through pulmonary shunts. The patient subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy including capecitabine and oxaliplatin for 6 months, and currently remains alive without any evidence of recurrence 12 months after the second surgery. This patient with SBA was an instructive case demonstrating the necessity of careful attention during major surgery in HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with a wide range of neurovascular abnormalities. The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, which function in regulating the transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways. Symptoms of HHT can be present in individuals who test negative for mutations in these three genes indicating other genes may be involved. In this study, we tested for mutations in two genes, RASA1 and GDF2, which were recently reported to be involved in vascular disorders. To determine whether RASA1 and GDF2 have phenotypic overlap with HHT and should be included in diagnostic testing, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to detect mutations in 93 unrelated individuals who previously tested negative for mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4, but were clinically suspected to have HHT. Pathogenic mutations in RASA1 were identified in two samples (2.15%) and a variant of unknown significance in GDF2 was detected in one sample. All three individuals experienced epistaxis with dermal lesions described in medical records as telangiectases. These results indicate that the inclusion of RASA1 and GDF2 screening in individuals suspected to have HHT will increase the detection rate and aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis.

To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case in the literature of definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia diagnosed in western Kenya, a resource-limited setting with limited treatment options. A 60-year-old black Kenyan woman was admitted 1 year ago to a hospital in western Kenya with an 11-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis. Her physical examination revealed that she had telangiectasias on the tongue and hard palate, severe pallor, and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe opacity. After a positive saline contrast echocardiography, she underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, which revealed a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and multiple hepatic arteriovenous malformations. Therefore, she fulfilled criteria for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was managed with nasal packing, tranexamic acid, oral ferrous sulfate, and blood transfusions, as other treatment options were unavailable in this setting. This rare case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates that it occurs in an African population and that diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings can be surmounted. Treatment options remain limited in these settings.

We describe staged diagnosis and therapy including individual medical treatments of 97 patients with HHT. The success of treatment is monitored with a systematic questionnaire. The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy remains standard treatment of choice with no major side effects despite the need for repeated treatment. In addition new treatment strategies like nasal occlusion, local drug therapy, and nasal septal splinting show initial success. Improvement of the quality of life of HHT patients can be achieved by a multimodal concept. Several new treatment strategies like nasal septal splinting and nasal occlusion successfully expand the range of established methods. Further studies have to prove the safety and long-term effectiveness of the described individual medical treatments.

"	"Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.

"	"Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. She denied any symptoms except recurrent epistaxis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. We performed open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.

Echocardiography showed moderate diastolic overload of both ventricles with enhanced cardiac output without valvular disease or cardiac shunt that could account for this cardiomegaly. A subsequent abdominal echocardiographic exploration showed an angiomatous transformation of the liver due to diffuse lacunar enlargement of hepatic portal vein branches and arterial-venous shunts. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the echocardiographic findings. The imaging findings coupled with cutaneous and nasopharyngeal lesions were suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the diagnosis was confirmed after the identification of a mutation in the ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12. HHT is a rare but underestimated vascular disease that can affect different organs, in particular the liver, leading to organ failure requiring transplantation as occurred in our patient. Echocardiography is a useful imaging tool to exclude cardiac abnormalities as a cause of cardiomegaly and to guide the correct diagnosis of a peripheral origin of high cardiac output.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that leads to frequent epistaxis. It can have a significant impact on quality of life. Many reports exist regarding various therapies to address the epistaxis. We presented our technique for addressing the epistaxis associated with HHT. Patients are treated in the operating room while they are under general anesthesia. A local anesthetic is injected sublabially, and oxymetazoline is dripped into the nose. The coblation wand is used to treat the telangiectasias. Bevacizumab is then injected into the nasal cavity bilaterally. The coblation wand, with or without adjunctive bevacizumab injection, is a technically feasible intervention for patients with HHT that all providers can perform.

"	"Endoglin (ENG)/CD105 is an essential endothelial cell co-receptor of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) and involved in tumor angiogenesis and preeclampsia. Here, we present crystal structures of the ectodomain of human ENG and its complex with the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). BMP9 interacts with a hydrophobic surface of the N-terminal orphan domain of ENG, which adopts a new duplicated fold generated by circular permutation. The interface involves residues mutated in HHT1 and overlaps with the epitope of tumor-suppressing anti-ENG monoclonal TRC105. The structure of the C-terminal zona pellucida module suggests how two copies of ENG embrace homodimeric BMP9, whose binding is compatible with ligand recognition by type I but not type II receptors. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the BMP signaling cascade, with implications for future therapeutic interventions in this fundamental pathway.

28578477	"Prevalence of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in patients operated for cerebral abscess: a retrospective cohort analysis
"	"It is well described that patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) have an increased risk of cerebral abscess (CA). However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%. The 3-month and 1-year mortality rates were 7.5% and 11.25%, respectively. There is an overrepresentation of HHT patients in a cohort of patients with CA, and HHT should be investigated as the cause of the CA if no other apparent cause can be identified.

"	"Children with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) may have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, clubbing, cyanosis and hemoptysis. However, some patients with pulmonary AVMs may be asymptomatic, placing them at risk for complications such as stroke or brain abscess if they are not identified and treated. This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs. Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.

"	"Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics RASA1-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. RASA1-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.

While the pathophysiology underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with HHT is not fully understood, it is believed to occur by one of two mechanisms: increases in pulmonary vascular resistance or cardiac output. In the following report, we describe an interesting case of a 26-year-old woman with HHT whose right heart catheterization initially demonstrated PH with elements of both pre- and post-capillary PH. Once the pre-capillary PH component was treated, however, an underlying high-normal cardiac-output state was unmasked. [Full article available at http://rimed.org/rimedicaljournal-2017-08.asp].

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a highly debilitating and life-threatening genetic vascular disorder arising from endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and hypervascularization, for which no cure exists. Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs. Tacrolimus repurposing has therefore therapeutic potential in HHT.

"	"To investigate the clinical features and feasibility genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) family, and to explore the application of gene mutation testing in HHT diagnosis.  Methods: Medical histories and clinical features of a family were analyzed to diagnose HHT patients and suspected individuals according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family. A combination of clinical and genetic diagnosis could improve the diagnosis and treatment of HHT.

29080903	"Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions
"	"Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, we hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.

"	"Our objective was to describe epistaxis onset and severity in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients and study the cumulative incidence of epistaxis by age of onset within each genetic subtype. Retrospective cohort chart review. Charts were reviewed of patients age 0 to 18 years with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of HHT who were evaluated at a tertiary multidisciplinary HHT clinic from January 2010 to June 2016. The epistaxis severity score (ESS), a validated tool for assessing epistaxis severity, was used to assess epistaxis. Statistical analyses were conducted on the full HHT cohort as well as subgroups stratified by the HHT causative gene (HHT1 = ENG and HHT2 = ACVRL1). Sixty-nine pediatric subjects were identified; 60 had HHT confirmed by genetic testing, and nine (from families with known mutations) met published clinical diagnostic criteria alone. Fifty-nine (85%) had onset of epistaxis. The median age of onset of epistaxis was 5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-9 years). The median ESS for the entire cohort was 1.6 (IQR: 0-2.6). The median ESS was higher in HHT1 versus HHT2 (2.3 vs. 1.1, P = .002), and age of epistaxis onset was earlier in HHT1 (3 vs. 5 years, P = .03). Sex and age were not associated with ESS. Epistaxis may present early in HHT, but is typically mild in the pediatric period. Severity in the pediatric population is worse in patients with HHT1. By recognizing the significance of even mild, infrequent epistaxis in a child with a family history of HHT, and understanding that not all HHT patients have epistaxis during childhood, community providers and otolaryngologist can assist in the early detection of HHT. 4 Laryngoscope, 128:1714-1719, 2018.

Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart.

HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.

Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2).

The influence of Alk1 downregulation on PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor B) expression was also studied on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells. The effect of PDGFB in mural cell recruitment in bAVM was explored by injection of a PDGFB overexpressing lentiviral vector to the mouse brain. Thalidomide or lenalidomide treatment reduced the number of dysplastic vessels and hemorrhage and increased mural cell (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) coverage in the bAVM lesion. Thalidomide reduced the burden of CD68+ cells and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the bAVM lesions. PDGFB expression was reduced in ALK1-knockdown human brain microvascular endothelial cells and in mouse bAVM lesion. Thalidomide increased Pdgfb expression in bAVM lesion. Overexpression of PDGFB mimicked the effect of thalidomide. Thalidomide and lenalidomide improve mural cell coverage of bAVM vessels and reduce bAVM hemorrhage, which is likely through upregulation of Pdgfb expression.

29610574	"Impact of Age on Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"There is little published literature regarding the impact of age on outcomes amongst hospitalized HHT (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) patients. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to obtain data on all hospital discharges occurring in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012. The association between admission age and HHT-related complications and outcomes were studied. 10293 hospitalizations in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012 were included. Patients > 50 accounted for 77% of all admissions with 30% of admissions occurring in the 51-65 age group. Bleeding related complications were the most frequent (62.7%,n= 6455 hospitalizations), followed by cardiovascular (41%,n= 4216), neurological (12.4%,n= 1276), and hepatobiliary (6.4%,n= 660) complications. Patients older than 50 accounted for 83% of bleeding events, 90% of cardiovascular events, 58% of neurologic events, and 81% of hepatobiliary events. The vast majority (83%) of medical and surgical procedures were performed in those older than 50 years of age. Older patients also experienced higher rates of death. Aging has significant adverse impacts on rates of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes amongst HHT patients in the United States. Except for neurologic complications, the vast majority of this disease burden is borne by patients older than 50 years.

"	"To evaluate the accuracy of the clinical Curaçao criteria in the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) in children and adolescents. This was a retrospective, multicenter chart review of 673 patients evaluated between 2002 and 2016; 290 were eligible for the study. Genetic testing for a pathogenic mutation was considered the gold standard against which the clinical Curaçao criteria were compared. Patients were divided into 4 age categories: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-21-years. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each age group, and for the overall population. Overall the Curaçao criteria had a sensitivity of 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 91%-100%). Sensitivity was lowest in the 0- to 5-year group, and increased with advancing age. The Curaçao criteria had the highest sensitivity in the 16- to 21-year-olds. Specificity was 100% in all age groups except for the 11- to 15-year-olds. This study evaluated the use of the Curaçao criteria for the diagnosis of HHT in the pediatric population with a family history of HHT. In those between the age of 0 and 21 years who meet 1 criterion (unlikely HHT) or 2 criteria (possible HHT), genetic testing is preferred for diagnosis. The Curaçao criteria appear to reliably diagnose HHT in children and adolescents who meet 3 or 4 criteria (definite HHT).

"	"A 76-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzyme levels, and abdominal imaging studies revealed a hepatic tumor. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 759.5 ng/mL. A pathological examination after hepatectomy confirmed a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An examination of the surrounding liver revealed dilated vessels and thickened endothelial cells without inflammations. HHT patients without other risk factors (like this patient) reportedly have a lower incidence of common cancers, including HCC, in comparison to the unaffected population. One intriguing hypothesis that might explain the hepatocarcinogenesis in this situation is the ischemic liver cirrhosis theory, which suggests that chronic ischemia may cause parenchymal strain and promote inappropriate hepatocyte proliferation.

"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be found in patients suffering from a loss-of-function mutation of the gene encoding for the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1 receptor. Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as epistaxis. Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH. Recently, it was shown that tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.

30272025	"Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required for RAD51-mediated maintenance of genome integrity in vascular endothelial cells
"	"The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.

"	"Introduction: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) mainly affecting the lungs and the liver. In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic vascular disease with a wordwide prevalence of 1:5000-1:10000. We introduce our algorithm for the stratified population screening of HHT. Probands are selected from the consecutive hospital database review for HHT (I7800) and recurrent epistaxis (R0400) and the review of patient records referred by family practicioners. A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

Capsule endoscopy (CE) is emerging as a safe and non-invasive alternative for small intestinal evaluation, but its diagnostic yield and utility in diagnosing small bowel AVMs in HHT patients are understudied. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze the utility of CE for diagnosing AVMs in HHT patients. Methods  A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature on CE in HHT patients identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2018 were conducted. Summary effects were estimated using a random effects model. Results  After applying exclusion criteria, five studies (n = 124 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic yield for visualization of small bowel AVMs by CE was 77.0 % (95 % CI 65.8 - 85.4 %, P  < 0.001). Conclusions  CE has a good diagnostic yield for small bowel AVMs in HHT. It can be regarded as a sufficient, noninvasive diagnostic modality for identifying small bowel AVMs in HHT patients.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular dysplasia that leads to nosebleeds and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Anti-angiogenic drugs thalidomide and bevacizumab have been increasingly used off-label with variable results. The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs) classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001). Thalidomide AEs occurred at more similar rates in males (25 AEs in 41 men, 60.9%) and females (12 in 26 (46.2%), but were more common in ENG patients (17 in 17) than in ACVRL1 (14 in 34, p < 0.0001). For bevacizumab, the most common reports were of joint pains (7/69, 10%), headache (3/69, 4.4%) and proteinuria (2/69, 3%), and for thalidomide, peripheral neuropathy (12/67, 18%); drowsiness (8/67, 12%); and dizziness (6/67, 9%). Fatal adverse events were more common in males (p = 0.009), and in patients with ENG pathogenic variants (p = 0.012). One fatal AE was possibly related to bevacizumab (average incidence rate: 1.5 per 100 person-years); 3 fatal AEs were possibly related to thalidomide (average incidence rate: 4 per 100 person-years). With potential increase in use of Bevacizumab and Thalidomide in HHT patients, data presented support appropriate weighing of the toxicities which can arise in HHT settings and the practice recommendations for their prevention and management.

30744395	"Angiopoietin-2 Inhibition Rescues Arteriovenous Malformation in a Smad4 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Mouse Model
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in 4 transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway members, including the central transcriptional mediator of the TGFβ pathway, Smad4. Loss of Smad4 causes the formation of inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can hemorrhage leading to stroke, aneurysm, or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and the TGFβ downstream effectors responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated AVM formation are currently unknown. To identify potential biological targets of the TGFβ pathway involved in AVM formation, we performed RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments on BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9)-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and isolated ECs from a Smad4-inducible, EC-specific knockout ( Smad4-iECKO) mouse model that develops retinal AVMs. These sequencing studies identified the angiopoietin-Tek signaling pathway as a downstream target of SMAD4. We used monoclonal blocking antibodies to target a specific component in this pathway and assess its effects on AVM development. Sequencing studies uncovered 212 potential biological targets involved in AVM formation, including the EC surface receptor, TEK (TEK receptor tyrosine kinase) and its antagonistic ligand, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2). In Smad4-iECKO mice, Angpt2 expression is robustly increased, whereas Tek levels are decreased, resulting in an overall reduction in angiopoietin-Tek signaling. We provide evidence that SMAD4 directly represses Angpt2 transcription in ECs. Inhibition of ANGPT2 function in Smad4-deficient mice, either before or after AVMs form, prevents and alleviates AVM formation and normalizes vessel diameters. These rescue effects are attributed to a reversion in EC morphological changes, such as cell size and shape that are altered in the absence of Smad4. Our studies provide a novel mechanism whereby the loss of Smad4 causes increased Angpt2 transcription in ECs leading to AVM formation, increased blood vessel calibers, and changes in EC morphology in the retina. Blockade of ANGPT2 function in an in vivo Smad4 model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia alleviated these vascular phenotypes, further implicating ANGPT2 as an important TGFβ downstream mediator of AVM formation. Therefore, alternative approaches that target ANGPT2 function may have therapeutic value for the alleviation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms, such as AVMs.

She presented with a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation to 91%, and lung disease was suspected. A PAVF was subsequently found in the right S6 region using contrast computed tomography. Interventional radiologists successfully occluded the shunt using 6 microcoils. PAVF should be considered when determining the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in patients with hypoxia, which can be the only symptom of PAVF.

Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up.

Recurrent epistaxis is the primary complaint in 90%-96% of HHT patients and the other symptoms come with age. The aim of this study was to analyze HHT-associated gene variant spectrum in Chinese HHT patients and to assess whether genetic testing could contribute to the early diagnosis. Thirty one HHT families including 62 individuals were recruited. Variants in the coding regions of four genes involved in HHT were amplified and analyzed using Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twenty unique variants, including 8 novel variants were found in 24 of the 31 (77.4%) kindred. Diagnosis is confirmed for 7 possible individuals from 6 kindred. Thirteen ACVRL1 variants were detected from 17 isolated HHT families. Variants in ACVRL1 from 8/17 (47.1%) families were located in exon8. Seven ENG variants were found in 7 unrelated families throughout the coding region. We conclude that ACVRL1 gene variant is 2.4 times more prevalent than that in ENG in Chinese individuals with HHT, and exon8 of the ACVRL1 gene may be a hotspot region. Genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis for HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation.

31540324	"Endoglin Protein Interactome Profiling Identifies TRIM21 and Galectin-3 as New Binding Partners
"	"Endoglin is a 180-kDa glycoprotein receptor primarily expressed by the vascular endothelium and involved in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene (ENG) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, a vascular disease that presents with nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. A circulating form of endoglin (alias soluble endoglin, sEng), proteolytically released from the membrane-bound protein, has been observed in several inflammation-related pathological conditions and appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cancer development through unknown mechanisms. Membrane-bound endoglin is an auxiliary component of the TGF-β receptor complex and the extracellular region of endoglin has been shown to interact with types I and II TGF-β receptors, as well as with BMP9 and BMP10 ligands, both members of the TGF-β family. To search for novel protein interactors, we screened a microarray containing over 9000 unique human proteins using recombinant sEng as bait. We find that sEng binds with high affinity, at least, to 22 new proteins. Among these, we validated the interaction of endoglin with galectin-3, a secreted member of the lectin family with capacity to bind membrane glycoproteins, and with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Using human endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that endoglin co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with galectin-3 or TRIM21. These results open new research avenues on endoglin function and regulation.

"	"The objective of this study was to report for the first time on the results of submucosal injections of bevacizumab used in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Retrospective analytic chart review. We performed a chart review that included all patients with HHT treated with intranasal bevacizumab and cyanoacrylate glue for refractory epistaxis at Lariboisiere University Hospital from 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. We injected 100 mg (25 mg/mL) of bevacizumab diluted in 2 mL of serum at the base of the telangiectasias, and sclerotherapy with an injection of cyanoacrylate glue was used adjunctively. Treatment efficacy was based on changes in Epistaxis Severity Scores (ESS) and the Bergler-Sadick Scale. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder (CL) and Likert scale, respectively. Thirty-one patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 26.6 months. The average ESS score significantly decreased from 7.82 to 3.89 (P < .05). The Bergler-Sadick score significantly improved (P < .05) following the treatment, including the frequency (from 2.74 to 1.64) and the quantity (from 2.54 to 1.51) scales. Quality of life was significantly improved (P < .05) using the CL score (from 4.16 to 7.22). The Likert satisfaction scale related to the treatment efficacy was high, with an average of 7.03 out of 10. No complications were noted. Submucosal injections of bevacizumab in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue sclerotherapy significantly reduced epistaxis and improved the quality of life in HHT. Prospective comparative studies are needed to further evaluate the significance of this treatment modality. 3b Laryngoscope, 129:2210-2215, 2019.

"	"Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting more than 98% of adults with HHT, with significant impact on quality of life. Floseal® has been shown to be effective for the management of anterior epistaxis, but has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in this population. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Floseal® for managing acute anterior epistaxis in patients with HHT. A pilot prospective clinical trial was conducted at two tertiary referral centres, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada and The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. All patients with HHT presenting with acute anterior epistaxis to the two study centres, who enrolled in the study, received Floseal® treatment. The primary outcome measures were achievement of hemostasis and changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) between baseline and one-month follow up. Secondary outcome measure included clinical assessment of the nasal cavity. Seven patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent treatment of anterior epistaxis with Floseal® and achieved control of epistaxis within 15-min post-application. Application of Floseal® was well tolerated, with patients reporting a pain score of 3 ± 3.13 out of 10. There was no statistically significant difference noted in ESS scores pre-treatment and one-month follow up, 6.27 ± 2.42 vs. 4.50 ± 2.44, p = 0.179. There was a significant improvement clinically on exam of the nasal cavity between baseline and at one-month follow up, indicated by a decrease in the clinical assessment score, 17.29 ± 7.70 vs. 9.57 ± 7.81 (p = 0.0088). Patients with HHT presenting with acute epistaxis were able to achieve hemostasis with one application of Floseal®, with the procedure being very well tolerated with minimal pain. Although there was no significant change in ESS scores, clinical assessment of the nasal cavity revealed significant improvement at one-month follow up post treatment with Floseal®. This multi-centered prospective clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02638012 ). Registered on December 22, 2015.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.

31828546	"BMP10-mediated ALK1 signaling is continuously required for vascular development and maintenance.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.

"	"We aimed to describe risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and endoscopic findings in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This is a prospective study from a referral HHT unit. Endoscopic tests were performed when there was suspicion of GI bleeding, and patients were divided as follows: with, without, and with unsuspected GI involvement. 67 (27.9%) patients with, 28 (11.7%) patients without, and 145 (60.4%) with unsuspected GI involvement were included. Age, tobacco use, endoglin (ENG) mutation, and hemoglobin were associated with GI involvement. Telangiectases were mostly in the stomach and duodenum, but 18.5% of patients with normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) had GI involvement in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Telangiectases ≤ 3 mm and ≤10 per location were most common. Among patients with GI disease, those with hemoglobin < 8 g/dL or transfusion requirements (65.7%) were older and had higher epistaxis severity score (ESS) and larger telangiectases (>3 mm). After a mean follow-up of 34.2 months, patients with GI involvement required more transfusions and more emergency department and hospital admissions, with no differences in mortality. Risk factors for GI involvement have been identified. Patients with GI involvement and severe anemia had larger telangiectases and higher ESS. VCE should be considered in patients with suspicion of GI bleeding, even if EGD is normal.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

A randomized controlled trial was performed randomizing individual PAVMs to treatment with IDC versus Nester coils at the largest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center in Canada. The primary outcome was CT evidence of reperfusion at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural complications, fluoroscopy time and contrast volume. Our study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and subsequent expiration of funding. A total of 46 PAVMs in 25 patients (64% female) were included in our study; 26 randomized to Nester coils and 20 randomized to IDC. One patient was lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 421.2 ± 215.7 days, no significant difference in PAVM reperfusion was detected between Nester coils and IDC (0% vs. 5.6%, p > 0.05). No major periprocedural complications were noted in either group. Fluoroscopy time (Nester: 15.0 ± 11.8 min vs. IDC 16.0 ± 5.4 min, p > 0.05) and contrast volume (Nester: 80.3 ± 36.5 ml vs. IDC 87.3 ± 51.7 ml, p > 0.05) utilized did not differ between groups. No significant difference was detected in PAVM reperfusion rates, periprocedural complication rates, contrast volume utilization or fluoroscopy time following embolization with IDC and Nester coils.

"	"Impaired ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1)/Endoglin/BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) signaling predisposes to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activation of SMAD1/5 signaling can be enhanced by shear stress. In the genetic disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is characterized by arteriovenous malformations, the affected receptors are those involved in the activation of mechanosensitive SMAD1/5 signaling. To elucidate how genetic and mechanical signals interact in AVM development, we sought to identify targets differentially regulated by BMP9 and shear stress. Approach and Results: We identify Cx37 (Connexin37) as a differentially regulated target of ligand-induced and mechanotransduced SMAD1/5 signaling. We show that stimulation of endothelial cells with BMP9 upregulated Cx37, whereas shear stress inhibited this expression. This signaling was SMAD1/5-dependent, and in the absence of SMAD1/5, there was an inversion of the expression pattern. Ablated SMAD1/5 signaling alone caused AVM-like vascular malformations directly connecting the dorsal aorta to the inlet of the heart. In yolk sacs of mouse embryos with an endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5, addition of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), which downregulates Cx37, induced development of these direct connections bypassing the yolk sac capillary bed. In wild-type embryos undergoing vascular remodeling, Cx37 was globally expressed by endothelial cells but was absent in regions of enlarging vessels. TNFα and endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5 caused ectopic regions lacking Cx37 expression, which correlated to areas of vascular malformations. Mechanistically, loss of Cx37 impairs correct directional migration under flow conditions. Our data demonstrate that Cx37 expression is differentially regulated by shear stress and SMAD1/5 signaling, and that reduced Cx37 expression is permissive for capillary enlargement into shunts.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral vascular malformations. Individuals suffering from HHT have a significantly increased risk of bacterial infections, but the mechanisms involved in this are not clear. White blood cell subpopulations were estimated with flow cytometry in 79 patients with HHT and 45 healthy individuals, and association with clinicopathological status was assessed. A prominent decrease in absolute numbers of T cells in HHT was revealed (0.7 (0.5-1.1) vs. 1.3 (0.8-1.6), 106/mL, p < 0.05), and in multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin level was associated with lymphopenia (OR = 0.625, 95% CI: 0.417-0.937, p < 0.05). Although no changes in absolute numbers of neutrophils and monocytes were observed, we revealed a significant impairment of neutrophil antibacterial functions in HHT (n = 9), compared to healthy individuals (n = 7), in vitro. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MOI10 was significantly suppressed in HHT (mean area per cell, mm2: 76 (70-92) vs. 121 (97-128), p < 0.05), due to impaired filamentous actin organization (% of positive cells: 69 (59-77) vs. 92 (88-94), p < 0.05). To conclude, this study reveals the categories of patients with HHT that are prone to immunosuppression and require careful monitoring, and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy based on the functional activation of neutrophils.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.

Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.

32538908	"Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization in Zebrafish Embryos and Tube Formation Assay in iPSC-ECs to Study the Role of Endoglin in Vascular Development
"	"Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.

32573726	"Mutational and phenotypic characterization of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia. Care delivery for HHT patients is impeded by the need for laborious, repeated phenotyping and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between causal DNA variants in ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4 and GDF2, and clinical manifestations. To address this, we analyzed DNA samples from 183 previously uncharacterized, unrelated HHT and suspected HHT cases using the ThromboGenomics high-throughput sequencing platform. We identified 127 rare variants across 168 heterozygous genotypes. Applying modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines, 106 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 21 as nonpathogenic (variant of uncertain significance/benign). Unlike the protein products of ACVRL1 and SMAD4, the extracellular ENG amino acids are not strongly conserved. Our inferences of the functional consequences of causal variants in ENG were therefore informed by the crystal structure of endoglin. We then compared the accuracy of predictions of the causal gene blinded to the genetic data using 2 approaches: subjective clinical predictions and statistical predictions based on 8 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Both approaches had some predictive power, but they were insufficiently accurate to be used clinically, without genetic testing. The distributions of red cell indices differed by causal gene but not sufficiently for clinical use in isolation from genetic data. We conclude that parallel sequencing of the 4 known HHT genes, multidisciplinary team review of variant calls in the context of detailed clinical information, and statistical and structural modeling improve the prognostication and treatment of HHT.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

32762495	"Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
"	"Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.

"	"To test if the impairment of mononuclear cell (MNC) migration in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is due to the reduction of the endoglin (ENG) receptor on the cell surface and oxidative stress. MNCs of HHT patients and normal controls were subjected to migration assay. Fractions of MNCs were pre-incubated with antibodies specific to HHT causative genes ENG [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1)] or activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2)], AMD3100 or Diprotin-A to block ENG, ALK1 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) or CD26 (increased in HHT1 MNCs) before migration assay. The MNCs were allowed to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 18 h. The expression of CXCR4, CD26, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) in MNCs and nitric oxide levels in the plasma were analyzed. Compared to the controls, fewer HHT1 MNCs and similar number of HHT2 MNCs migrated toward SDF-1α. Diprotin-A pre-treatment improved HHT1 MNC-migration, but had no effect on normal and HHT2 MNCs. Pre-incubation with an anti-ENG antibody reduced the migration of normal MNCs. Diprotin-A did not improve the migration of ENG antibody pre-treated MNCs. Anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on MNC-migration. AMD3100 treatment reduced normal and HHT MNC-migration. ENG mRNA level was reduced in HHT1 and HHT2 MNCs. ALK1 mRNA was reduced in HHT2 MNCs only. CD26 expression was higher in HHT1 MNCs. Pre-treatment of MNCs with anti-ENG or anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on CD26 and CXCR4 expression. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, SOD1, was reduced in HHT1 MNCs, which was accompanied with an increase of ROS in HHT MNCs and nitric oxide in HHT1 plasma. Reduction of ENG receptor on MNC surface reduced monocyte migration toward SDF-1α independent of CD26 expression. Increased oxidative stress could alter HHT MNC migration behavior.

The epistaxis can be difficult to control despite available treatments. Dysregulated angiogenesis has been shown to be associated with telangiectases formation. Topical propranolol has demonstrated antiangiogenic properties. We performed a two-phase study, i.e., a double-blind placebo-controlled phase, followed by an open-label phase. The aim of the study was assessment of safety and efficacy of nasal propranolol gel in HHT-related epistaxis. Twenty participants with moderate-severe HHT-related epistaxis were randomized to eight weeks of propranolol gel 1.5%, or placebo 0.5 cc, applied to each nostril twice daily; and continued propranolol for eight weeks in an open-label study. For the propranolol group, the epistaxis severity score (ESS) improved significantly (-2.03 ± 1.7 as compared with -0.35 ± 0.68 for the placebo group, p = 0.009); hemoglobin levels improved significantly (10.5 ± 2.6 to 11.4 ± 2.02 g/dL, p = 0.009); and intravenous iron and blood transfusion requirement decreased. The change in nasal endoscopy findings was not significant. During the open-label period, the ESS score improved significantly in the former placebo group (-1.99 ± 1.41, p = 0.005). The most common adverse event was nasal mucosa burning sensation. No cardiovascular events were reported. Our results suggest that topical propranolol gel is safe and effective in HHT-related epistaxis.

To develop and validate an epistaxis-specific quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure for HHT. This survey study focused on the development and validation of the Nasal Outcome Score for Epistaxis (NOSE) in HTT (NOSE HHT) outcome measure with data prospectively collected from December 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. A total of 401 patients were recruited from within the Cure Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia online patient advocacy social media network, the Washington University HHT Center of Excellence, and a randomized clinical trial investigating an intranasal timolol gel for HHT-associated epistaxis. Face and content validity, factor analysis, internal consistency as measured through Cronbach α, construct validity, responsiveness to change, and minimal clinically important difference. The NOSE HHT was developed and validated with a possible score ranging discretely from 0 to 4 for each of the 29 items and a total score ranging continuously from 0 to 4 after dividing by the total number of items answered. A total of 401 participants completed the NOSE HHT. Factor analysis identified 3 factors that matched the a priori specified subgroups of particular aspects of life affected by HHT-associated epistaxis: physical problems (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.59 [0.83]), functional limitations (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.28 [0.84]), and emotional consequences (mean [SD] magnitude, 1.95 [1.02]). The instrument had high internal consistency with an overall Cronbach α of 0.960. Convergent validity determined the total NOSE HHT score to be a strong predictor of disease severity; total NOSE HHT score can be split up into the following epistaxis severity categories: mild (0-1), moderate (1.01-2), and severe (>2). The instrument was found to be sensitive to change, and the minimal clinically important difference for the total NOSE HHT score was 0.46. Evaluation of the consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of the NOSE HHT survey found it to be a valid instrument to assess severity and change in epistaxis. Study results suggest that the NOSE HHT survey is clinically applicable and useful as an outcome measure of future HHT-associated epistaxis trials.

HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.

Laser photocoagulation was done in selected cases (40%) and if unsuccessful, septal dermoplasty was performed (2.3%). Endovascular embolization was reserved for life-threatening emergencies (7%). Epistaxis in HHT is not curable, but can be managed by employing a comprehensive stepwise approach. An algorithm for effective and comprehensive management has been presented.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

"	"A girl, aged 15 years, was admitted due to sudden convulsion once and multiple pulmonary nodules on lung CT. Acrocyanosis or acropachy/toe deformity was not observed. Laboratory examinations showed an increase in hemoglobin (162 g/L) and a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (61.5 mm Hg). Lung CT showed irregular slightly high-density nodules in the middle lobe of the right lung, and contrast-enhanced CT scan showed obvious enhancement with thick vascular shadow locally. An investigation of medical history revealed that the girl's mother had a history of epistaxis and resection of pulmonary mass and the girl presented with tongue telangiectasia. The girl was diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. she was given interventional embolization therapy. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation reached 98% without oxygen inhalation on the day after surgery. Pulmonary angiography at 3 months after surgery showed the recurrence of pulmonary vascular malformation, and embolization of pulmonary arterial fistula was not performed since the guide wire could not enter the branch artery. There was still a need for long-term follow-up.

"	"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of rufinamide relative to topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a three-year time horizon in patients with LGS uncontrolled by up to three antiepileptic drugs. Utilities were assigned to health states, defined according to a patient's response to treatment (> or =75%, > or =50% and <75%, and <50% reduction in tonic-atonic [drop attack] seizure frequency and death). Efficacy and safety estimates were made using indirect/mixed-treatment comparisons of data obtained from published literature. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), allowing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be estimated as cost per QALY gained. Over three years, the total cumulative costs for rufinamide, topiramate, and lamotrigine were pound24,992, pound23,360, and pound21,783, respectively. Rufinamide resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.079 relative to topiramate and 0.021 relative to lamotrigine. The incremental costs of rufinamide were pound1632 and pound3209, relative to topiramate and lamotrigine, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound20,538 and pound154,831, respectively. Considering the underlying assumptions, this current economic evaluation demonstrates that rufinamide is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate as adjunctive treatment for children with LGS in the UK. In addition, when compared to lamotrigine, which is an inexpensive treatment, rufinamide should be considered as a cost-effective alternative due to the importance of patient choice and equity of access in such a rare and devastating condition.

"	"The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of resective pediatric epilepsy surgery for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We analyzed clinical data of 27 children and adolescents who had LGS and underwent resective epilepsy surgery despite abundant (>30% of preoperative interictal and/or ictal epileptiform discharges) generalized or generalized contralateral maximal and multiregional electroencephalogram abnormalities. On high-resolution MRI, cerebral lesions were noted in 23 (85.2%) patients but not in 4 (14.8%) patients. The age of patients at the time of surgery was between 1.7 and 17.3 years (mean: 7.8 years). Surgeries were lobar or multilobar resection in 21 (77.8%) patients and hemispherotomy in 6 (22.2%). At a mean of 33.1 months' postoperative follow-up, 16 (59.3%) patients had no seizures and 4 (14.8%) had infrequent seizures. Of 4 patients without brain abnormalities found on MRI, 2 patients became seizure-free after resective surgery was performed on the basis of electrophysiologic studies and concordant results in other multimodal neuroimages. Malformation of cortical development was the most common pathology and was seen in 20 (74.1%) patients, but 2 (7.4% patients) did not show any abnormal pathology. Sixteen (72.7%) patients, including 14 who had no seizures and 2 who had infrequent seizures after surgery, showed an increase in developmental quotient. No clinical profile was significantly associated with postoperative seizure-free rate. Resective epilepsy surgery should be considered for children with LGS, despite abundant generalized and multiregional electroencephalogram abnormalities.

"	"The magnitude and causes of death among a cohort of children with epilepsy were determined. A follow-up study with a population-based cohort of 10-year-old children in the metropolitan Atlanta area with epilepsy was conducted. The National Death Index and linkage to State of Georgia death certificates were used to identify deaths. The authors estimated the expected numbers of deaths by applying mortality rates adjusted by age, race, and sex for the entire state of Georgia to the population for the follow-up period. Among the 688 children who were in the final epilepsy cohort, 64 deaths occurred; 20.6 deaths were expected (mortality ratio adjusted for age, race, and sex = 3.11). The mortality ratios for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms were 13.92 and 11.91, respectively. Children and adolescents with epilepsy, especially those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or infantile spasms, have an increased risk of death.

"	"Rufinamide was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) as adjunctive therapy in patients aged 4 years and older. Rufinamide pharmacokinetics (PK) has been established on pooled data from several clinical studies in epilepsy, including one in LGS patients. Demographic covariates and drug-drug interactions with several antiepileptic drugs have been explored using population PK modelling. Two types of drug-drug interactions models were developed and compared. The PK analysis demonstrated that the coadministration of valproate decreases rufinamide clearance, requiring potential dose adjustment. To explore rufinamide exposure under different dosing regimens in LGS patients, clinical trial simulations were performed. The objective of the simulations was to select the doses giving an exposure shown to be safe and efficacious in larger populations. The concentrations simulated in a subgroup of patients with body weight less than 30 kg presented a larger inter-individual variability than in other patients. Additional simulations demonstrated that this increased variability was due partly to greater valproate concentrations in some of the children treated with rufinamide. Simulations of the rufinamide exposure under different maximum daily dose in presence and in absence of valproate co-administration were used to establish the dosing recommendation. The simulations support the proposal of a lower maximum daily rufinamide dose for patients under 30 kg receiving both drugs: the dose of 600 mg/day was proposed as a maximum daily dose in children also receiving valproate concomitantly, whereas in absence of valproate, the maximum daily dose is 1000 mg/day.

"	"The last 20 years have witnessed a tremendous explosion in the number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as well as the introduction of AEDS developed for specific epilepsy syndromes. The study of the efficacy and side effect profile of AEDs for unique epilepsy syndromes has allowed neurologists to utilize evidence-based medicine when treating patients. In late 2008, the Food and Drug Administration approved rufinamide for adjunctive use in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This unique chemical compound is also the first new AED to reach the market in the United States having a pediatric indication prior to approval for adults. Rufinamide appears to have a broad spectrum of efficacy, is well tolerated, and may be rapidly initiated--properties that will likely extend its use outside of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

20151724	"The cost effectiveness of rufinamide in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in the UK
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic childhood form of epilepsy. The syndrome is characterized by mental impairment, frequent seizures of multiple types that are particularly resistant to treatment, and high rates of seizure-related injury. With the introduction of newer, but more costly, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is important that decision makers are able to assess their value in the management of this rare and difficult-to-treat condition. To evaluate the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of rufinamide in patients with LGS. An individual patient-simulation model was developed to estimate the total treatment-related costs and clinical benefits of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine over a 3-year time horizon. The model examines the treatment scenarios of adding rufinamide, lamotrigine or topiramate to older AEDs (standard therapy), or standard therapy alone within a primary-care or community setting. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials of adjunctive AED treatment for children with LGS were analysed. There are no head-to-head comparator studies. Between 98 and 139 patients were randomized in each study and the mean age in each study was 10, 11 and 14 years. A mixed-treatment comparison using a random-effects model was carried out on the number of patients in each response category, using the placebo arms of the respective trials. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of successfully treated patients, defined as >50% reduction in the frequency of total seizures and drop attacks. The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. Costs ( pound, year 2006/07 values) of patient monitoring, switching treatments, hospitalization due to seizure, treatment of adverse effects, and personal and social services were included in the analysis. Results of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were bootstrapped to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Over 3 years, adjunctive rufinamide resulted in higher total costs than topiramate and lamotrigine; however, with more patients being treated successfully, this leads to acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. If society is prepared to pay at least 250 pounds for a 1% increase in the number of successfully treated LGS patients, in terms of a 50% reduction in the frequency of drop attacks, the probability of the treatment with rufinamide being cost effective is >80%. This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that rufinamide results in more LGS patients being treated successfully at a reasonable cost from a UK NHS perspective.

"	"Recently, we published the first postmarketing European experience with rufinamide (RUF) in a retrospective 12-week observational study. This follow-up report summarizes the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of RUF after 18 months for the same patient sample. In total, 52 of 60 initially included patients from eight centers in Germany and Austria (45 children and 15 adults aged 1-50 years) with various severe and inadequately controlled epilepsy syndromes continued treatment with RUF after the initial 3-month observation period (mean final dose: 38.2+/-17.3mg/kg/day). Efficacy was assessed by seizure frequency evaluated by comparison with baseline frequency. Tolerability was evaluated by analysis of parental report of adverse events and laboratory tests. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a 50% or greater decrease in countable seizures within 18 months of initiating RUF therapy. Mean overall duration of RUF treatment was 14.5 months (range: 3-18 months). Retention rate, defined as the percentage of patients still taking RUF after 18 months, was 41.7% (n=25/60). The overall response rate after 18 months was 26.7% (16/60 patients). The highest response rates were found in the subgroup of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS, 35.5%) and in patients with other generalized epilepsy syndromes. Complete seizure control was maintained in one patient (1.6%). A total of 73 adverse events were reported in 37 of 60 patients. The most frequently occurring adverse events were fatigue (18.3%), vomiting (15.0%), and loss of appetite (10.0%). Only 4 new adverse events were reported after week 12. No serious adverse events were observed. The present data suggest that RUF is efficacious and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of children and adults with various epilepsy syndromes and difficult-to-control seizures.

"	"Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy and is frequently associated with brain malformations, such as hemimegalencephaly. Recently, longer expansion of the first polyalanine tract of ARX was found to be causative for Ohtahara syndrome without brain malformation, whereas premature termination mutations of ARX were found to cause severe brain malformations, such as lissencephaly or hydranencephaly. Both are designated as ARX-related interneuronopathies. We investigated the molecular basis of Ohtahara syndrome in two families, comprising six male patients in two generations demonstrating X-linked inheritance. Novel frameshift mutations in the terminal exon of the ARX gene (Ala524fsX534 and E536fsX672) were identified in two patients (2 and 13 years, each) from both families. Two patients developed West syndrome, and one of these later developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all patients showed no brain malformations in contrast to the patients with a premature termination mutation in other exons of ARX. The etiology of Ohtahara syndrome is heterogeneous; however, the molecular analysis of ARX should be considered in sporadic or familial male patients with Ohtahara syndrome.

Treatment effects on EEG, developmental outcome and the ""outcome-predictive"" value of various clinical factors were also assessed. 50 children (22 boys; mean age 4.5 years+/-3.55) were included. Mean follow-up was 3.93+/-2.95. 50% of the patients were responders, 48% of them became seizure free. 50% were non-responders, 20% of them deteriorated. In responders, EEG background activity improved significantly (p=0.014) and a significantly lower rate of epileptic discharges (p=0.009) was seen after 6 months. In addition, neurological examination findings demonstrated significant developmental progress (p=0.038). Favourable treatment outcome was associated with a shorter disease duration (p=0.025) and generalised tonic clonic seizures (p=0.059). No further significant outcome predictors were detected. However, response was 44% in patients with infantile spasms, 62.5% in those with Dravet syndrome and 50% in Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome. Side effects occurred in 28%, but discontinuation of the KD was not required in any case. They most often observed with concomitant topiramate (p=0.001) and valproate (p=0.046). Despite the retrospective nature of the study and the inhomogeneous patient sample, we found good long-term effects of the KD on seizure frequency, EEG and neurological development.

The seizure numbers were assessed using clinician's global impression scale (CGI) and patient diaries. The average seizure reduction was 23% at the first year and 22% at the second year. Seizure reduction was more pronounced among patients with nonfocal than with focal epilepsy. The response rate was 50% at first year and 30% at the second year. The best CGI record for clinically significant improvement was 15% in the LGS group. The only statistically significant result was the reduction of the generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The side-effect profile was good; however, the large number of mild and reversible effects influenced the stimulation parameters and thus probably the effectiveness of the therapy. We suggest that VNS is an optional treatment mostly in cases of therapy-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients with GTCS may experience improvement such as reduction of seizure severity. We conclude that VNS is a safe neuromodulatory treatment, but future developments of neuromodulatory approaches are needed.

"	"Dietary therapies are established as beneficial for symptomatic generalized epilepsies such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; however, the outcome for idiopathic generalized epilepsy has never been specifically reported. The efficacy of the ketogenic and modified Atkins diet for childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy was evaluated from both historical literature review and patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Upon review of 17 published studies in which absence epilepsy was included as a patient subpopulation, approximately 69% of 133 with clear outcomes patients who received the ketogenic diet had a >50% seizure reduction, and 34% of these patients became seizure free. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, the ketogenic diet (n = 8) and modified Atkins diet (n = 13) led to similar outcomes, with 18 (82%) having a >50% seizure reduction, of which 10 (48%) had a >90% seizure reduction and 4 (19%) were seizure free. Neither age at diet onset, number of anticonvulsants used previously, particular diet used, nor gender correlated with success.

"	"Rufinamide is a new antiepileptic drug recently approved as adjunctive treatment for generalized seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We undertook a retrospective analysis of 77 patients with refractory epilepsy and receiving rufinamide to evaluate the drug's efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing schedules. It appeared efficacious in diverse epilepsy syndromes, with the highest responder rate in focal cryptogenic epilepsies (81.1% of patients with >50% response rate), and in diverse seizure types, with the highest responder rate in tonic/atonic and partial seizures (48.6% and 46.7% of patients with >50% response rate, respectively). Rufinamide was well tolerated: only 13% of patients developed side effects necessitating drug withdrawal. These findings suggest that rufinamide may possess good efficacy and tolerability, and that its efficacy may extend to epilepsy syndromes beyond Lennox-Gastaut, including both partial and generalized epilepsy syndromes.

"	"This is the first multicenter Italian experience with rufinamide as an adjunctive drug in children, adolescents and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The patients were enrolled in a prospective, add-on, open-label treatment study from 11 Italian centers for children and adolescent epilepsy care. Forty-three patients (26 males, 17 females), aged between 4 and 34 years (mean 15.9 ± 7.3, median 15.0), were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months). Twenty patients were diagnosed as cryptogenic and 23 as symptomatic. Rufinamide was added to the baseline therapy at the starting dose of 10mg/kg body weight, evenly divided in two daily doses and then increased by 10mg/kg approximately every 3 days up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day in children aged ≥4 years with a body weight less than 30 kg. In patients more than 30 kg body weight, rufinamide could be titrated up to 3200 mg/day. After a mean follow-up period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months), the final mean dose of rufinamide was 33.5mg/kg/24h (range 11.5-60) if combined to valproic acid, and of 54.5mg/kg/24h (range 21.8-85.6) without valproic acid. The response rate (≥50% decrease in countable seizures) was 60.5% (26 of 45 patients) in total; 51.1% experienced a 50-99% reduction in seizure frequency and complete seizure control was achieved in the last 4 weeks follow-up by 9.3% of patients. Two patients (4.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in 13 (30.2%) and increased in 2 (4.7%). Reliable data for atypical absence seizures and myoclonic seizures were not available, as these are usually impossible to count. Ten patients (23.2%) reported adverse side effects, while taking rufinamide. They were generally mild and transient and most frequently included vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite. In conclusion, rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy reduced the number of drop attacks and major motor seizures in about 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and produced only mild or moderate adverse side effects.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare but debilitating pediatric epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple intractable seizure types. Treatment of LGS is challenging because of the small number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which are effective for this syndrome, as well as the need for polytherapy in the majority of patients. This review focuses on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide, a recently approved third-generation AED with reported efficacy as adjunctive therapy for LGS. All relevant papers identified through a PubMed search on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide were reviewed. To date, the literature suggests improvements in seizure frequency for pediatric patients with LGS on rufinamide. Rufinamide appears to be especially effective for atonic or drop attack seizures. Rufinamide also displays a favorable adverse event profile compared with the older anticonvulsants, as well as a minimal number of drug interactions, making it a promising option for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS.

Here, we report patients with LGS who underwent resective surgery, following CC better delineating the presumed seizure foci localized in one hemisphere. We retrospectively reviewed seven patients with LGS who underwent CC and subsequent cortical resection. The median follow-up duration after lobectomy was 20 months (range, 15-54 months) and three patients had follow-up periods over 24 months. The findings of video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, structural and functional neuroimagings were compared between pre- and post-CC. Four patients had Engel class I and one patient had Engel class II outcomes following cortical resection; post-CC, compared to pre-CC, showed better localized ictal/interictal epileptiform discharges in the unilateral frontal area in two patients, in the unilateral parieto-temporo-occipital areas in one patient and in the unilateral fronto-temporal areas in the remaining two patients. Two patients had Engel Class III outcome following cortical resection; post-CC EEG continued to show multifocal epileptiform discharges but predominantly arising from a unilateral frontal area. Following CC, positron emission tomography showed localized glucose hypometabolism of which location was concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in all patient. Similarly, ictal/interictal single photon emission computed tomography also showed localized abnormalities concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in five of the six patients. Pathological assessment revealed cortical dysplasia in six patients, whereas no pathological abnormality was found in the remaining patient, who obtained Engel Class I outcome following cortical resection. CC could change EEG findings, glucose metabolisms and cerebral blood flows, and it is sometimes helpful in delineating the primary seizure focus in patients with LGS.

Infantile spasms and Dravet syndrome experienced the lowest efficacy. No patient with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was aggravated. LVT dose over 40 mg/kg/d was associated with a lower response rate. Tolerability was excellent.

Numerous source-imaging algorithms for localizing epileptogenic zones based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been developed and validated in simulation and experimental studies. Recently, intracranial EEG (iEEG)-based imaging of epileptogenic sources has attracted interest as a promising tool for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy; however, most iEEG studies have focused on localization of epileptogenic zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated whether iEEG source imaging is a useful supplementary tool for identifying extended epileptogenic sources in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). To this end, we applied four different cortical source imaging algorithms, namely minimum norm estimation (MNE), low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA (sLORETA), and L(p)-norm estimation (p = 1.5, referred to as Lp1.5), to artificial iEEG datasets generated assuming various source sizes and locations. We also applied these four algorithms to clinical ictal iEEG recordings acquired from a pediatric patient with LGS. Interestingly, the traditional MNE algorithm outperformed the other imaging algorithms in most of our experiments, particularly in cases when larger-sized sources were activated. Although sLORETA outperformed both LORETA and Lp1.5, its performance was not as good as that of MNE. Compared to the other algorithms, the performance of Lp1.5 decayed most rapidly as the source size increased. Our findings suggest that iEEG source imaging using MNE is a promising auxiliary tool for the identification of epileptogenic zones in secondary generalized epilepsy. We anticipate that our results will provide useful guidelines for selection of an appropriate imaging algorithm for iEEG source imaging studies.

"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is an orphan drug for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in persons aged 4 years and older. Several studies have investigated the pharmaconkinetics of RUF, but information about interactions is still limited and the results are in part inconsistent. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of age, gender, daily RUF dose per body weight (mg/kg), valproic acid (VPA), and enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) on RUF concentration-to-dose ratio (RUF serum concentration/RUF dose per body weight), RUF clearance (RUF dose/RUF serum concentration), and RUF trough concentrations. Different statistical methods were used to evaluate 292 blood samples from 119 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In summary, the results using generalized estimating equation regression models confirm a moderate but statistically significant nonlinear RUF concentration-dose relationship. At steady state, the trough concentrations of RUF increase in a less than dose proportional manner. Children (younger than 12 years) had significantly lower RUF concentrations (19.0%, P < 0.001) than adults (18 years or older) on comparable RUF doses per body weight. VPA was the most frequent comedication (51%) in our patient group. Mean RUF concentrations were 86.6% higher when VPA concentrations were greater than 90 μg/mL (P < 0.001) and 45.4% higher when VPA concentrations were between 50 and 90 μg/mL (P < 0.001) but not significantly different at VPA concentrations less than 50 μg/mL (4.4%, P > 0.1) compared with combinations without VPA. In combination with EIAEDs, mean RUF concentrations were 21.8% lower (P = 0.002) compared with combinations without EIAEDs. However, the group of AEDs classified as EIAEDs was heterogeneous and the number of patients, especially of children with EIAEDs, was relatively small. Our data indicate that oxcarbazepine and, especially, methsuximide decrease RUF concentrations as well. Therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful because RUF concentrations differ markedly in patients on comparable RUF doses.

After one year of stimulation, thirteen patients with SE-MISF (52%) and three patients with LGS (21%) showed a reduction above 50% in all seizures' frequency rate. As for drop attacks, eight patients (20%) gained a reduction above 50%, while seven patients (17%) showed a reduction only in intensity and duration. Cognitive level and adaptive behaviour were unchanged, while a better quality of life was reported in half out of the patients. VNS had a greater effect in reducing seizures frequency and drop attacks' intensity and duration in SE-MISF patients than LGS patients. An improved quality of life was observed also in those patients who only reduced the intensity and duration of drop attacks.

21397780	"Bioavailability of three rufinamide oral suspensions compared with the marketed 400-mg tablet formulation: results from a randomized-sequence, open-label, four-period, four-sequence crossover study in healthy subjects
"	"Rufinamide is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged ≥4 years. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the relative bioavailability and other pharmacokinetics of rufinamide administered as a 400-mg tablet formulation (reference) with 10 mL of a newly developed 40-mg/mL suspension (test) manufactured using 3 different homogenization speeds in healthy subjects under fed conditions. The study also explored whether homogenization speed had any effect on rufinamide pharmacokinetics when administered as a suspension formulation. This was a randomized, open-label, crossover, single-dose study in healthy, fed subjects aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive), conducted at a single center in the United Kingdom. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences, with each sequence consisting of 4 treatment periods. In each treatment period, subjects received a single dose of either the reference product (400-mg rufinamide tablet) or the test product (10 mL of rufinamide suspension [40 mg/mL] manufactured using 3 different homogenization speeds [1800, 2100, and 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm)]). Serial blood samples were collected for 72 hours after dosing for the measurement of rufinamide in plasma. Primary comparisons between test (suspension) and reference (tablet) formulations focused on AUC from 0 to 72 hours (AUC(0-72 h)) and C(max). The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the ratios of geometric least squares means and associated 90% CIs of AUC(0-72 h) and C(max) were within the predetermined range of 80%-125%, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements. Tolerability was assessed by subject interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Twenty-four healthy subjects were randomized: 8 were male and 16 were female; 22 white, 1 black, and 1 Asian subjects were enrolled. Mean (SD) age was 29.8 (10.0) years. Mean weight was 68.2 (11.0) kg, and mean body mass index was 23.6 (3.0) kg/m(2). Twenty-one subjects completed the study; 2 subjects discontinued because of adverse events (both urinary tract infections considered unrelated to treatment) and 1 because of protocol deviation. The 72-hour pharmacokinetic data for the last complete treatment period before discontinuation were included in group means. The geometric least squares mean C(max) value for the reference tablet formulation was 4840.24 ng/mL; and 4254.87, 4204.29, and 4418.44 ng/mL for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm test suspensions, respectively. The ratios of the geometric least squares mean values (test/reference) for C(max) were 0.88 (90% CI, 0.84-0.92), 0.87 (0.83-0.91) and 0.91 (0.88-0.95) for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively, compared with the tablet formulation. The geometric least squares mean AUC(0-72 h) values were 75,960.48 ng · h/mL for the tablet formulation and 74,279.02, 73,746.03, and 73,701.17 ng · h/mL for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively. The ratios of the geometric least squares mean values (test/reference) for AUC(0-72 h) were 0.98 (90% CI, 0.95-1.00), 0.97 (0.95-1.00) and 0.97 (0.95-0.99) for the 1800-, 2100-, and 3000-rpm suspensions, respectively, compared with the tablet formulation. The ratios and associated 90% CI limits (for test suspensions to the reference tablet) for AUC(0-72 h) and C(max) were within the FDA and EMA criteria for assuming bioequivalence to the 400 mg tablet. Comparisons among the 3 rufinamide test suspensions also met the regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to one another. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 18.2% (4/22) of subjects treated with the 400-mg tablet, 21.7% (5/23) of subjects treated with the 1800-rpm suspension, 26.1% (6/23) of subjects treated with the 2100-rpm suspension, and 8.7% (2/23) of subjects treated with the 3000-rpm suspension. Overall, 54.2% (13/24) of subjects experienced a TEAE; all TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, with headache being the most frequently reported (37.5% [9/24]). There were no serious adverse events or deaths. This single-dose study in a small population of fed, healthy subjects found no statistically significant differences in relative bioavailability among each of the 3 test suspensions and the currently marketed 400-mg tablet formulation of rufinamide, meeting FDA and EMA regulatory requirements for assuming bioequivalence.

21464890	"Efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy in a model of acute seizures and in a population of pediatric drug resistant epileptics
"	"Targeting pro-inflammatory events to reduce seizures is gaining momentum. Experimentally, antagonism of inflammatory processes and of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage has been demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing status epilepticus (SE). Clinically, a role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of drug resistant epilepsies is suspected. However, the use anti-inflammatory drug such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) is limited to selected pediatric epileptic syndromes and spasms. Lack of animal data may be one of the reasons for the limited use of GCs in epilepsy. We evaluated the effect of the CG dexamethasone in reducing the onset and the severity of pilocarpine SE in rats. We assessed BBB integrity by measuring serum S100β and Evans Blue brain extravasation. Electrophysiological monitoring and hematologic measurements (WBCs and IL-1β) were performed. We reviewed the effect of add on dexamethasone treatment on a population of pediatric patients affected by drug resistant epilepsy. We excluded subjects affected by West, Landau-Kleffner or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and Rasmussen encephalitis, known to respond to GCs or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effect of two additional GCs, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, was also reviewed in this population. When dexamethasone treatment preceded exposure to the convulsive agent pilocarpine, the number of rats developing status epilepticus (SE) was reduced. When SE developed, the time-to-onset was significantly delayed compared to pilocarpine alone and mortality associated with pilocarpine-SE was abolished. Dexamethasone significantly protected the BBB from damage. The clinical study included pediatric drug resistant epileptic subjects receiving add on GC treatments. Decreased seizure frequency (≥ 50%) or interruption of status epilepticus was observed in the majority of the subjects, regardless of the underlying pathology. Our experimental results point to a seizure-reducing effect of dexamethasone. The mechanism encompasses improvement of BBB integrity. Our results also suggest that add on GCs could be of efficacy in controlling pediatric drug resistant seizures.

The present study aimed to estimate the ictal onset zone of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) with bilaterally synchronous epileptiform discharges from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings using directional connectivity analysis. We analyzed ictal iEEG data acquired from three LGS patients who underwent epileptic surgery with favorable surgical outcomes. To identify the ictal onset zones, we estimated the functional directional connectivity network among the intracerebral electrodes using the directed transfer function (DTF) method. The analysis results demonstrated that areas with high average outflow values corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified using electrophysiologic data and conventional neuroimaging modalities. Our results suggest that the DTF analysis can be a useful auxiliary tool for determining surgical resection areas prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients. This is the first research article demonstrating that directional connectivity analysis of iEEG recording data can be used for delineating surgical resection areas in generalized epilepsy patients who need surgical treatment.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an intractable childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Seizure freedom is rare in LGS. One of the hallmarks of LGS is medical intractability, with generally poor response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Nevertheless, several treatment options are available that can mitigate the severity of seizures and curtail their frequency. New AEDs have been validated in randomized, controlled trials for the treatment of seizures in LGS. In some cases, nonpharmacologic options may be effective, although more data are needed to confirm efficacy outcomes. Comprehensive patient assessments are critical to achieve an optimal AED treatment regimen and minimize the potential for adverse effects.

It was granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in the United States in 2004, and released for use in Europe in 2007. In January 2009, rufinamide was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of LGS in children 4 years of age and older. It is also approved for adjunctive treatment for partial seizures in adults and adolescents. Rufinamide's efficacy mainly against atonic/tonic seizures in patients with LGS seems nowadays indubitable and has been confirmed both in randomized controlled trial and in open label extension studies. More recently, rufinamide was evaluated for the adjunctive treatment of childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathies and epileptic syndromes other than LGS, including epileptic spasms, multifocal epileptic encephalopathy with spasm/tonic seizures, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy.

Responder rates (≥50%) were 31.6% (placebo) vs 43.4% (p = 0.3383), 58.6% (p = 0.0159), and 77.6% (p < 0.0001) for clobazam 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg/day groups. Physicians' and caregivers' assessments indicated clobazam significantly improved symptoms. Somnolence, pyrexia, upper respiratory infections, and lethargy were the most frequent adverse events reported for clobazam. Clobazam significantly decreased weekly drop seizure rates in LGS. No new safety signals were identified. This study provides Class II evidence that clobazam as adjunctive therapy is efficacious, in a dosage-dependent manner, in reducing mean weekly drop seizure rates of patients with LGS over 12 weeks.

"	"Precise localization of ictal onset zones is of great clinical importance for successful surgery in patients with intractable drug-resistant epilepsy. Time delay analysis has been one of the most reliable and most widely used computational electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis methods for localizing ictal onset zones. However, the majority of previous studies have only been applied to the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings acquired from patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome (LGS), which is a type of intractable, pediatric, secondary generalized epilepsies with bilaterally synchronous ictal epileptiform discharges. To estimate the ictal onset zones from ictal iEEG recordings, we estimated time delays among iEEG signals based on the information theoretical approach. The results of the time delay analysis applied to the iEEG data of four successfully treated LGS patients corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified by experienced epileptologists and multiple neuroimaging modalities, suggesting that the time delay analysis may provide useful information on the precise locations of ictal onset zones prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients.

22128252	"Clobazam as an adjunctive therapy in treating seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by the occurrence of multiple types of seizures and cognitive decline. Most children suffer from frequent seizures that are refractory to current medical management. Recent clinical trials have suggested that addition of clobazam may improve the clinical outcome for some LGS patients. Although clobazam has been available for over five decades, it has only recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. As a 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam is structurally related to the widely used 1,4-benzodiazepines, which include diazepam. Clobazam has been shown to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission by positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors, and to increase expression of transporters for both GABA and glutamate. The active metabolite n-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) also modulates GABA(A) receptors, and the relative importance of these two compounds in the clinical effectiveness of clobazam remains an open question. Clinical trials involving clobazam as an addon therapy in a variety of pediatric epilepsy populations have found a significant improvement in seizure control. In patients with LGS, clobazam may have greatest efficacy for drop seizures. Longstanding clinical experience suggests that clobazam is a safe and well tolerated antiepileptic drug with infrequent and mild adverse effects. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with clobazam may be a reasonable option for LGS patients, particularly those who are treatment-resistant.

22245794	"Drug-induced QT-interval shortening following antiepileptic treatment with oral rufinamide
"	"The arrhythmogenic potential of short QT intervals has recently been highlighted in patients with a short QT syndrome. Drug-induced QT-interval prolongation is a known risk factor for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, reports on drug-induced QT-interval shortening are rare and proarrhythmic effects remain unclear. Recently, rufinamide, a new antiepileptic drug for the add-on treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, was approved in the European Union and the United States. Initial trials showed drug-induced QT-interval shortening. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of rufinamide on QT intervals in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Nineteen consecutive patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other epilepsy syndromes were included (n = 12 men; mean age 41 ± 12 years). QRS, QT, and T(peak)-T(end) intervals were analyzed before and during rufinamide treatment. The mean QT interval shortened significantly following rufinamide administration (QT interval 349 ± 23 ms vs 327 ± 17 ms; corrected QT interval 402 ± 22 ms vs 382 ± 16 ms; P = .002). T(peak)-T(end) intervals were 79 ± 17 ms before and 70 ± 20 ms on treatment (P = .07). The mean reduction of the corrected QT interval was 20 ± 18 ms. During follow-up (3.04 ± 1.09 years), no adverse events including symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths were observed. QTc-interval shortening following oral rufinamide administration in a small patient group was not associated with significant clinical adverse effects. These observations notwithstanding, the ability of rufinamide to significantly shorten the QT interval portends a potential arrhythmogenic risk that may best be guarded against by periodic electrocardiographic recordings.

"	"Neuroscientists are becoming interested in the application of computational EEG analysis to the identification of ictal onset zones, however, most studies have focused on the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. The present study aimed to estimate the ictal onset zone of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) with bilaterally synchronous epileptiform discharges from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings using directional connectivity analysis. We analyzed ictal iEEG data acquired from three patients with LGS. To identify the ictal onset zones, we estimated the functional directional connectivity network among the intracerebral electrodes using the directed transfer function (DTF) method. The analysis results demonstrated that areas with high average outflow values corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified using electrophysiologic data and conventional neuroimaging modalities. Our results suggest that the DTF analysis can be a useful auxiliary tool for determining surgical resection areas prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients.

"	"We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the orphan drug rufinamide (RUF) in children with pharmacoresistant myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome). This was a retrospective European multicenter study on eight patients who had started an intention-to-treat trial of RUF between July 2007 and June 2010. Clinical information was collected via questionnaire. Responder rate was defined as reduction of seizure frequency ≥50% in comparison to four weeks before starting RUF. Maximum follow-up was eighteen months. Responder rates were 7/8 patients after 3 months, 6/8 patients after 6 months and 5/8 patients after 12 months. RUF seemed particularly effective in the prevention of myoclonic-astatic seizures (comparable with drop attacks in Lennox-Gastaut-Syndrome, for which RUF is particularly effective). Some loss of efficacy was noticed in the long-term observation. Side-effects occurred in two patients. Seizure aggravation was not observed. RUF seems to be a promising therapeutic option in children with MAE. Further studies are warranted to confirm these first observations.

"	"To evaluate the efficacy of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in children and adolescents with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The study was an open-label, observational clinical trial of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in intractable LGS patients. This intent-to-treat trial included 4 weeks of scheduled titrated doses and a 12-week maintenance phase with a target dose of 20-40 mg/kg rufinamide, adjusted according to its effectiveness and tolerability after a baseline period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome was measured by the seizure-reduction rate according to individual seizure type over the 12-week maintenance period. One hundred and twenty-eight patients with LGS who were determined to be unresponsive to one or more antiepileptic drugs or dietary therapy were enrolled. Of the 128 patients enrolled, 112 (87.5%) completed the study. After add-on rufinamide treatment, 46 patients (35.9%) achieved a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 10 (7.8%) patients became seizure-free. When we identified those who responded with an at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency, 39.4% of the responders reported reductions in convulsive seizures, 36.4% in drop attacks, 33.3% in myoclonic seizures, and 20.0% in epileptic spasms. Overall, 32.8% of patients reported adverse effects, which were mostly mild and transient in nature. The most common adverse effects were fatigue (15 patients, 11.7%) and poor appetite (9 patients, 7.0%). Twenty-one (16.4%) patients experienced an increased seizure frequency. Rufinamide appears to be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for many cases of intractable LGS.

"	"To investigate potential drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme substrates, inhibitors, and inducers. Two, prospective, open-label, single-center, drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies and a population pharmacokinetics analysis of seven multicenter phase II-III trials. Clinical research unit. Fifty-four healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the two drug-drug interaction studies; 53 completed the studies. The population pharmacokinetics analysis evaluated data from 171 participants from five studies with healthy volunteers and two studies with patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Participants in these studies received clobazam and stable dosages of the following antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, felbamate, or oxcarbazepine. In the first drug-drug interaction study, 36 participants received a single oral dose of clobazam 10 mg on day 1, followed by either ketoconazole 400 mg once/day or omeprazole 40 mg once/day on days 17-22, with a single dose of clobazam 10 mg coadministered on day 22, to study the effects of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibition, respectively, on clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB). In the second study, 18 participants received a drug cocktail consisting of caffeine 200 mg, tolbutamide 500 mg, dextromethorphan 30 mg, and midazolam 4 mg on days 1 and 19, and clobazam 40 mg/day on days 4-19, to study clobazam's effects on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In the first DDI study, coadministration of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and clobazam increased clobazam's area under the concentration time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) 54% and decreased clobazam's maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) by 15% versus administration of clobazam alone, but the combination affected these pharmacokinetic parameters for N-CLB to a lesser degree. The CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole increased AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of N-CLB by 36% and 15%, respectively, but did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. At steady state, N-CLB has 3-4 times greater exposure than clobazam. In the second DDI study, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions were observed between clobazam 40 mg and the CYP probe substrates caffeine or tolbutamide. Exposure to midazolam and its 1-hydroxymidazolam metabolite, however, decreased by 27% and increased 4-fold, respectively. Clobazam increased dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) AUC(0-∞) by 95% and C(max) by 59%. In the population pharmacokinetics analysis, stable dosages of common antiepileptic drugs that induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C19, or inhibit CYP2C19, had negligible effects on clobazam or N-CLB. Clobazam did not affect valproic acid or lamotrigine exposures. These findings suggest no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions between clobazam and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, or CYP2C9. Concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require dosage adjustment. Clobazam may be administered safely as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, without meaningful changes in clobazam pharmacokinetics that would require dosage adjustment.

Thirteen consecutive patients with infantile or early childhood onset epilepsy underwent 1-stage total corpus callosotomy for alleviation of seizures. Their age at surgery ranged from 1 year and 5 months to 24 years (median 7 years). Eleven patients had West syndrome at the onset of disease, and the other 2 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. All patients suffered from spasms, axial tonic seizures, or atonic seizures. Six patients had proven etiology of epilepsy, including tuberous sclerosis, polymicrogyria, trauma, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. The association between postoperative seizure freedom and preoperative factors including age at surgery, no MRI abnormalities, proven etiology, and focal electroencephalographic epileptiform discharges was examined. Postoperative seizure freedom was achieved in 4 of 13 patients for a minimum of 12 months. All 4 patients had no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology. None of the 8 patients with MRI abnormality, 6 patients with known etiology of epilepsy, or 4 patients aged older than 10 years at surgery achieved seizure freedom. Two of the 7 patients with focal electroencephalographic abnormalities became seizure free. Absence of MRI abnormalities was significantly associated with postoperative seizure freedom (p < 0.01). Complete seizure remission is achieved after total corpus callosotomy in a subgroup of patients with intractable epilepsy following West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. One-stage total corpus callosotomy at a young age may provide a higher rate of seizure freedom, especially for patients with no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology of epilepsy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy in SMDC using monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous system, by the frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability.  We studied six patients with SMDC (3 patients with cerebral palsy, 1 patient with posttraumatic syndrome after head injury, 1 patient with herpes encephalitis sequelae, and 1 patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome characterized by frequent seizures, developmental delay and psychological and behavioral problems), aged 18-26 (mean 22.5 ± 3.5).  By frequency domain method using electrocardiography, we measured the high frequency (HF; with a frequency ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), which represents parasympathetic activity, the low frequency/high frequency ratio, which represents sympathetic activity between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, and heart rate.  A music therapist performed therapy to all patients through the piano playing for 50 min.  We monitored each study participant for 150 min before therapy, 50 min during therapy, and 10 min after therapy.  Interestingly, four of 6 patients showed significantly lower HF components during music therapy than before therapy, suggesting that these four patients might react to music therapy through the suppression of parasympathetic nervous activities.  Thus, music therapy can suppress parasympathetic nervous activities in some patients with SMDC.  The monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous activities could be a powerful tool for the objective evaluation of music therapy in patients with SMDC.

"	"Four young patients, including a 7-year-old girl with Aicardi syndrome, an 11-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a 22-year-old man with epilepsy due to childhood encephalitis, and a 17-year-old girl with Rett syndrome, were scheduled to undergo extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urolithiasis. Epilepsy in all of the patients was well controlled by medication. Series of ESWL treatment were safely performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. We recommend that maintenance of anesthesia be performed by sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, which can increase threshold of epileptic stroke, and controlled ventilation with a muscle relaxant should be performed to prevent lung or renal injury by the shock wave of ESWL.

"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a novel antiepileptic drug considered as second-line therapy in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) have consisted mainly of drowsiness, irritability, vomiting, and loss of appetite. RUF is considered as a ""weight-neutral"" drug. We found clinically significant weight loss in 7 of 15 consecutive adult patients (47%; 3 male, 4 female, aged 18-31 years) treated with RUF as add-on therapy (800-2,400 mg/day: 23.5-57.1 mg/kg/day). The body mass index (BMI) decreased by 7.3-18.7%. Two patients were obese class I before RUF. Five patients (71%) were underweight before RUF (mild in one case, moderate in two cases, and severe in two cases). Four of these patients stopped RUF because of this adverse effect. RUF was recommenced in two patients using a lower and slower dosing strategy; one patient showed improvement in seizure control and no weight loss but RUF was re-stopped in the second patient because of continued weight loss. Despite of weight loss, RUF was continued in two other patients because it reduced seizure activity. We primarily related weight loss to reduced food intake, that is, loss of appetite and nausea, although in two patients no obvious loss of appetite was reported. RUF can cause clinically significant weight loss in adult patients, even at low dose. This AE can affect patients who are already underweight. There is a possibility that lower starting doses and slower escalation might minimize weight loss, but further information is required to determine whether this is the case.

"	"We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate cortical excitability changes in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), anticipating we would find a marked increase in excitability compared to other patients with refractory epilepsies. Eighteen patients with LGS were studied. Motor threshold (MT), short intracortical inhibition (paired pulse TMS at 2 and 5 msec interstimulus intervals [ISIs]), intracortical facilitation (10 and 15 msec ISIs), and long intracortical inhibition (100-300 msec ISIs) were measured. Results were compared to those of 20 patients with chronic refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), 20 patients with chronic refractory focal epilepsy, and 20 healthy nonepilepsy controls. A significant decrease in cortical excitability was observed in LGS compared to the other two groups with refractory epilepsy as evidenced by increased MT and intracortical inhibition at both short (2, 5 msec ISIs), and long (100-300 msec ISIs) as well as decreased intracortical facilitation (10, 15 msec ISIs), (p < 0.01; effect sizes ranging from 0.3 to 1.8). Cortical excitability was also lower in LGS compared to nonepilepsy controls (increased MT and decreased intracortical facilitation; p < 0.05; effect sizes ranging from 0.5 to 0.9). Interictal cortical excitability is decreased in LGS; a feature that distinguishes it from other refractory epilepsy syndromes. This decrease may be an important mechanism for the neurobehavioral comorbidities associated with LGS.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an uncommon epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, we tried to determine the clinical and EEG characteristics of patients with LGS in south Iran. In this retrospective study, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of LGS were recruited at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 2008 through 2012. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), epilepsy risk factors, EEG and imaging findings of all patients were registered routinely. During the study period, 2500 patients with epilepsy were registered at our epilepsy clinic. One-hundred and thirty-five patients (5.4%) were diagnosed as having LGS. Age of onset (mean±standard deviation) was 3.2±3.8 years. In 14 (10.4%) patients, age of onset was above 8 years. Eighty-three patients (61.5%) were male and 52 (38.5%) were female. The most common seizure type was tonic, followed by generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. The most common EEG finding was slow spike-wave complexes. The most common abnormal MRI finding was brain atrophy. LGS is an uncommon epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple seizure types, a specific electroencephalographic pattern and psychomotor retardation, beginning in childhood. However, variants of this classical triad including atypical EEG findings, normal psychomotor function, and late-onset disease could be seen in some patients. These atypical findings in a patient with typical history for LGS should not deter from the correct diagnosis. The mainstay for making a correct syndromic diagnosis is a detailed clinical history.

"	"We have examined brainstem lesions in patients with refractory epilepsy disorders, including West syndrome (WS), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Acetylcholinergic neurons (AchNs) in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) are involved in mental development, and disruption of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can lead to epilepsy. In order to investigate the involvement of lesions of AchNs in refractory epilepsy, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of AchNs in the PPN in autopsy cases who had a past history of WS and/or LGS and in DRPLA cases who showed progressive myoclonic epilepsy. In addition, we performed a preliminary quantification of the levels of acetylcholine, neuropeptides, and monoamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with WS and benign convulsions associated with mild gastroenteritis (CwG). In the PPN analysis, the total number of neurons and the number of AchNs were reduced in WS/LGS and WS cases, while DRPLA cases showed a decrease in the number and percentage of AchNs. In the CSF analysis, WS patients demonstrated a reduction in the levels of inhibitory neuropeptides, while CwG patients showed increased levels of acetylcholine and decreased levels of serotonin metabolites. These data suggest the possible involvement of lesions of AchNs in WS and DRPLA.

"	"Atypical absence epilepsy (AAE) showing slow spike-and-wave discharges (SWD) is characterized by severely abnormal cognition and neurodevelopmental or neurological outcomes in humans. However, despite the severe behavioral outcomes in AAE, the relationship between AAE and social-behavioral dysfunctions has not defined well, either experimentally or in patients with AAE. Experimentally, AAE can be produced by administering AY-9944 (AY), a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor. In this study, we characterized social behavior in the AY mouse model of AAE. AAE in the mouse was induced by repeated postnatal administration of AY every 6 days from postnatal day (P) 2 to P20. AY-treated mice exhibited spontaneous, recurrent, and synchronous SWD (4-5 Hz) in electroencephalographic recordings. AY-treated mice performed tasks involving sociability/social novelty preference, social interaction with a juvenile conspecific, observational fear, and resident-intruder aggression. They showed behavioral dysfunction in social interactions with a juvenile conspecific and sociability/social novelty preference tasks. They also exhibited reduced social fear learning in observational fear conditioning. Interestingly, they showed increased levels of offensive behaviors in a resident-intruder task. However, AY-treated mice displayed normal levels of anxiety in light/dark transition and the elevated plus maze tasks, and showed slightly increased locomotor activity in an open-field task. These results demonstrate social dysfunction in the AY-induced AAE model. Our study of social behavior can also provide valuable information about Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, in which AAE is a component. Thus, our findings may help to understand behavioral pathogenesis or characteristics of patients with AAE.

"	"In the study of 887 new born infants with prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage, 11 children with West syndrome that progressed into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and another 4 children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome that had not been preceded by West syndrome were found. In this study we present the main findings of these 15 subjects. In all infants multifactor antecedents were detected. The most frequent risk factors were prematurity and severe asphyxia; however placenta disorders, sepsis, and hyperbilirubinemia were also frequent. In all infants MRI direct or secondary features of periventricular leukomalacia were observed. Followup of all infants showed moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delay as well as cerebral palsy. It is concluded that prenatal and perinatal risk factors for brain damage are very important antecedents that should be taken into account to follow up those infants from an early age in order to detect and treat as early as possible an epileptic encephalopathy.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED), which is known to be effective in the treatment of partial seizures and drop attacks in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in those with LGS. Patients with LGS who had received rufinamide adjunctive therapy were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively reviewed these patient's baseline clinical characteristics, and the reduction of seizure frequency and adverse events after the use of rufinamide. Twenty-three patients (15 males and 8 females, ages 4-22 years) were enrolled in the study. All the patients suffered from daily head drops and tonic seizures despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. After one month of rufinamide, one patient (4.3%) achieved freedom from seizures, ten (43.5%) achieved a ≥50% decrease in seizure frequency. After six months of rufinamide, eight patients (34.8%) maintained a satisfactory response (seizure free in one, and greater than 50% seizure reduction in seven). Adverse events were reported in six (26.0%) patients, which were somnolence in three, aggressive behavior in two, and aggravation of seizure in one patient. Our results suggest that rufinamide is effective and safe in children and young adults with LGS.

A retrospective, observational study at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China and Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, USA (2001-2010) was performed. There were 36 cases of PVS diagnosed. In Beijing, there were 19 cases: mean age 57 years, range 3-86, (42 %) female, with 37 % of patients observed to survive more than 1 year (range >1 month to >28 years, median >6 months). Causes of PVS in Beijing were hemorrhagic stroke (n = 4, 21 %), ischemic stroke (n = 2, 11 %), cardiac arrest (n = 5, 26 %, including 4 with attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)), traumatic brain injury (n = 3, 16 %), and one each of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and epilepsy with craniopharyngioma (n = 4, 21 %). In Baltimore, there were 17 cases of PVS: mean age 43 years, range 15-83, 59 % female, with 41 % observed to survive more than 1 year (range >1 month to >10 years, median >3 years). Causes of PVS in Baltimore were ischemic stroke (n = 3, 18 %), cardiac arrest (n = 3, 18 %, including one with attempted CPR), traumatic brain injury (n = 3, 18 %), neurodegenerative conditions (n = 2, 12 %), and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to respiratory arrest (n = 3, 18 %), metabolic derangements (n = 2, 12 %), and meningitis (n = 1, 6 %). There may be a long survival period for patients with PVS, including in China where resource constraints exist for acute neurologic care. Stroke appears to be the most common underlying cause of PVS in Chinese patients, followed closely by cardiac arrest with attempted CPR. There appear to be more varied causes of PVS in the US referral hospital with a predominance of stroke, cardiac arrest, and traumatic brain injury.

"	"Epileptic encephalopathies are an epileptic condition characterized by epileptiform abnormalities associated with progressive cerebral dysfunction. In the classification of the International League Against Epilepsy eight age-related epileptic encephalopathy syndromes are recognized. These syndromes include early myoclonic encephalopathy and Ohtahara syndrome in the neonatal period, West syndrome and Dravet syndrome in infancy, myoclonic status in nonprogressive encephalopathies, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and epilepsy with continuous spike waves during slow wave sleep in childhood and adolescences. Other epileptic syndromes such as migrating partial seizures in infancy and severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci may be reasonably added. In this paper, we provide an overview of epileptic encephalopathies including clinical neurophysiological features, cognitive deterioration, and management options especially that these conditions are generally refractory to standard antiepileptic drugs.

"	"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Little is known about VNS therapy for children with epilepsy. This article will: (1) Review the contemporary medical literature related to VNS therapy in children with epilepsy, (2) describe the experience of VNS treatment in 153 children less than 18 years of age, in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Program, from 1998 to 2012, and (3) describe the surgical technique used for VNS implantation at UCLA. Review of the literature finds that despite different etiologies and epilepsy syndromes in children, VNS appears to show a similar profile of efficacy for seizure control compared to adults, and low morbidity and mortality. The UCLA experience is similar to that reported in the literature for children. VNS constitutes about 21% of our pediatric epilepsy surgery volume. We have implanted VNS in infants as young as six months of age and the most common etiology is the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. About 5% of the patients are seizure-free with VNS therapy and there is a low rate of surgically related complications. The UCLA surgical approach emphasizes minimal direct manipulation of the vagus nerve and adequate wire loops, to prevent a lead fracture. In summary, VNS is a viable palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy in children, with outcomes and complications equal to adult patients. Being a small child is not a contraindication for VNS therapy, if needed for refractory epilepsy.

"	"Although intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) has been widely used to localize epileptogenic zones in epilepsy, visual inspection of iEEG recordings does not always result in a favorable surgical outcome, especially in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Various computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been introduced to confirm the visual inspection results. Of these methods, high gamma oscillation in iEEG has attracted interest because a series of studies have reported a close relationship between epileptogenic zones and cortical areas with high gamma oscillation. Meanwhile, frequency domain source imaging of EEG and MEG oscillations has proven to be a useful auxiliary tool for identifying rough locations of epileptogenic zones. To the best of our knowledge, however, frequency domain source imaging of high gamma iEEG oscillations has not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether the iEEG-based frequency domain source imaging of high gamma oscillation (60-100 Hz) would be a useful supplementary tool for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. The method was applied to three successfully operated on LGS patients, whose iEEG contained some ictal events with distinct high gamma oscillations before seizure onset. The resultant cortical source distributions were compared with surgical resection areas and with high gamma spectral power distributions on the intracranial sensor plane. While the results of the sensor-level analyses contained many spurious activities, the results of frequency domain source imaging coincided better with the surgical resection areas, suggesting that the frequency domain source imaging of iEEG high gamma oscillations might help enhance the accuracy of pre-surgical evaluations of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy.

Fatty acids are the most important constituent of the KD in all aspects of efficacy and complications. Among fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increase anticonvulsant properties and reduce the complications associated with the high-fat diet. Here, we report a 7-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome combined with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency, whose medically intractable seizures have been successfully controlled with a PUFA-enriched modified Atkins diet without any significant adverse events. The diet consists of canola oil and diverse menu items like fish and nuts instead of olive oil and has an ideal 1:2.8 ratio of omega-3 to omega-6. In addition, fractionation of this boy's plasma showed normal levels of fatty acids, including omega-3 (alpha-linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid, arachidonic acid) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid). Plasma docosahexanoic acid remained low after PUFA-enriched diet therapy. PUFA-enriched diet therapy is likely to increase the efficacy of diet therapy and reduce complications of a high-fat diet in children with refractory epilepsy.

Palliative procedures such as callosotomy (Cx), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation have been offered. We compared the outcomes after Cx or VNS in two consecutive prospective cohorts of patients with generalised epilepsy. Twenty-four patients underwent callosotomy from 2006 to 2007 (Group 1); 20 additional patients were submitted to VNS from 2008 to 2009 (Group 2). They had generalised epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut or Lennox-like type. They were submitted to a neurological interview and examination, interictal and ictal video-EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI, and cognitive and quality of life evaluations. The two-year post-operative follow-up results were evaluated for each patient. The final mean stimuli intensity was 3.0 mA in the Group 2 patients. Seizure-free patients accounted for 10% in Group 1 and none in Group 2. Ten and sixteen percent of the Group 1 and 2 patients, respectively, were non-responders. Improvements in attention and quality of life were noted in 85% of both Group 1 and 2 patients. Rupture of the secondary bilateral synchrony was noted in 85% of Group 1 patients; there was no EEG modification after VNS in Group 2. Both procedures were effective regarding the control of atypical absences and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Both procedures were not effective in controlling tonic seizures. Callosotomy was very effective in reducing the frequency of atonic seizures, but VNS was ineffective. In contrast, callosotomy was not effective in reducing myoclonic seizures, whereas VNS was. Callosotomy might be preferred as the primary treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and no specific findings on MRI if atonic seizures prevail in the patient's clinical picture; when myoclonic seizures prevail, the same might hold true in favour of VNS. When atypical absence or generalised tonic-clonic seizures are the main concern, although both procedures carry similar effectiveness, VNS might be considered a good option as an initial approach, taking into account the adverse event profile.

23531645	"Short-term efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide adjunctive therapy in children with refractory generalised epilepsy
"	"We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide adjunctive therapy in children with refractory generalised epilepsy. The study cohort consisted of 20 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 5 with Dravet syndrome, and 28 with unclassified refractory generalised epilepsy. Patients with more than 50% seizure reduction at three and six months were defined as responders. The overall response rate was 37.7% at three months and 34.0% at six months. At three months, patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (40.0%) and epilepsy with spasms/tonic seizures (38.5%) showed higher response rates than those with Dravet syndrome (20.0%) and epilepsy with myoclonic seizures (20.0%). High response rates in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (30.0%) and epilepsy with spasms/tonic seizures (38.5%) were sustained throughout the six-month study. The accuracy of, and differences between, responder rates should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients. Overall, rufinamide appeared to be effective and reasonably well tolerated in this group of children with refractory generalised epilepsies, although a subgroup of patients with Dravet syndrome and epilepsy with myoclonic seizures were less responsive to rufinamide treatment.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 4 years of age and older, based upon clinical trials demonstrating clinical efficacy and tolerability. Rufinamide is especially effective for tonic-atonic seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but is subsequently proving to be safe and effective in clinical practice for a broad patient population with refractory epilepsy. Although further research and clinical experience is needed, rufinamide holds the promise to positively impact the care of children with epilepsy. In this review, we review the use of rufinamide in pediatric epilepsy, with a focus on efficacy and safety.

"	"The optimum drug treatment for ultrarefractory epilepsy after failure of seven prior antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) remains uncertain. Prompted by reports that adjunctive amantadine or l-dopa has been useful for children with refractory absence seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, we studied the utility of dopaminergic agents for adults with ultrarefractory epilepsy. We assessed seizure control following adjunctive treatment for up to 12 months with the dopaminergic agent Madopar© in three adult patients with ultrarefractory epilepsy following brain injury or with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, who had not achieved sustained seizure remission during past treatment with at least seven lifetime AEDs. The adjunctive use of Madopar was associated with a reduction or remission of tonic-clonic seizures in two patients. However, Madopar seemed to have aggravated absence seizures in the patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although our preliminary observations do not and cannot establish the efficacy or safety of adjunctive Madopar, it may be an option for treatment of ultrarefractory focal seizures in adults if confirmed by randomized controlled trials.

We assessed the side effect and seizure reduction profile of tiagabine (TGB) in typical clinical practice. Investigators recorded adverse effect (AE), seizure, and assessment-of-benefit data prospectively in sequential patients treated open label with TGB. Two hundred ninety-two patients (39 children) were enrolled to be treated long term with TGB. Seizure types were focal-onset (86%), generalized-onset (12%), both focal- and generalized-onset (0.3%), and multiple associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (2%). Two hundred thirty-one received at least one dose of TGB (median = 28 mg/day) and had follow-up seizure or AE data reported. Common AEs were fatigue, dizziness, psychomotor slowing, ataxia, gastrointestinal upset, weight change, insomnia, and ""others"" (mostly behavioral). Serious AEs occurred in 19 patients: behavioral effects (n = 12), status epilepticus (n = 3), others (n = 3), and sudden unexplained death (n = 1). No patients experienced suicidal ideation/behavior, rash, nephrolithiasis, or organ failure. Seizure outcomes were seizure freedom (5%), ≥75% reduction (12%), ≥50% reduction (23%), and increased number of seizures (17%), or new seizure type (1%). Behavioral AEs occurred in a larger proportion of patients compared to those reported in TGB preapproval randomized controlled trials. A moderate percentage of patients had a meaningful reduction in seizure frequency. In clinical practice, TGB remains a useful antiepileptic drug.

"	"West syndrome (WS) is an epileptic encephalopathy of childhood, defined by the presence of clustered spasms usually occurring before the age of 1 year, hypsarrhythmia on EEG that is notoriously difficult to define, and developmental arrest or regression. The incidence of WS is 1:3200 live births with an aetiology-dependent prognosis. Up to 80% of children with symptomatic WS suffer from mental retardation, and approximately 50% develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing, we identified a ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) guanine nucleotide-exchange factor two (brefeldin A-inhibited) (ARFGEF2) mutation in five related infants with WS. ARFGEF2 is involved in the activation of ARFs by accelerating replacement of bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) with Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and is involved in Golgi transport. A mutation in ARFGEF2 has been previously described only once, causing microcephaly and periventricular heterotopia. Here, we describe a novel ARFGEF2 mutation in five related patients presenting with WS, microcephaly, periventricular heterotopia and thin corpus callosum.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a catastrophic childhood cryptogenic or symptomatic epilepsy. Hypothalamic hamartomas cause refractory epilepsy often consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were defined by a triad of multiple generalized seizure types, slow spike-and-wave on EEG, and mental retardation. Twenty-one of 159 hypothalamic hamartoma patients (14%) met the diagnostic criteria of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The median age of patients at epilepsy onset was 0.9 years (range, birth to 9 years). Six of the 21 patients (28%) had preceding infantile spasms. All patients underwent different surgical approaches, including endoscopic, transcallosal, orbitozygomatic resections, and radiosurgery treatment. Five of the 21 (24%) were seizure free with an additional 9 (42%) having at least >90% seizure reduction. Only 1 patient was not effectively treated (<50% seizure reduction). Eighty-eight percent of parents reported improvement in behavioral functioning. Shorter duration of epilepsy prior to surgery was a significant predictor of surgical outcome. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptomatic to hypothalamic hamartomas have better postsurgical outcome due to other etiologies compared with cryptogenic and symptomatic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients. However, compared with overall hypothalamic hamartomas postsurgical outcomes, this cohort was less favorable. Earlier surgery may lead to better outcomes.

Surgical treatments included lobar resection, hemispherotomy and corpus callosotomy (CC). Seventy-six children were Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and 19 had West syndrome. of the 76 patients with LGS, CC was performed in 37 patients (48.7%), lobar resection in 29 (38.2%) and hemispherotomy in 10 (13.2%). Of the 19 patients with West syndrome, respective surgery was performed in 15 patients (78.9%) and CC in 4 (21.1%). Of the patients receiving respective surgery, Engel's class I outcomes were achieved for 24 of 39 (61.5%) of LGS patients, and for 9 of 15 (60.0%) of West syndrome. Malformations of cortical development were commonly observed, appearing in 73.5% (36/49). In neuropsychiatric tests, 19 of 27 with LGS demonstrated improvement in postoperative cognitive function. More significant intellectual improvement correlated well with shorter epilepsy duration, good seizure outcomes, and decreased number of antiepileptic drugs. epilepsy surgery should be considered in treating childhood intractable EE with expectation of improvement of both seizure and cognitive outcomes, even in cases of LGS.

We studied 13 well-characterized patients with LGS using structural imaging and EEG-fMRI at 3 tesla. Ten patients had cortical structural abnormalities. PFA and SSW were considered as separate events in the fMRI analysis. Simultaneous with fMRI, PFA was recorded in 6 patients and SSW in 9 (in 2, both were recorded). PFA events showed almost uniform increases in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in ""association"" cortical areas, as well as brainstem, basal ganglia, and thalamus. SSW showed a different pattern of BOLD signal change with many areas of decreased BOLD signal, mostly in primary cortical areas. Two patients with prior callosotomy had lateralized as well as generalized PFA. The lateralized PFA was associated with a hemispheric version of the PFA pattern we report here. PFA is associated with activity in a diffuse network that includes association cortices as well as an unusual pattern of simultaneous activation of subcortical structures (brainstem, thalamus, and basal ganglia). By comparison, the SSW pattern is quite different, with cortical and subcortical activations and deactivations. Regardless of etiology, it appears that 2 key, but distinct, patterns of diffuse brain network involvement contribute to the defining electrophysiologic features of LGS.

Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

Clinical data were used to estimate baseline frequency and the percentage of drop-seizure reductions over 3 months (all comparators) and 2 years (rufinamide). Claims data from a large US health care plan were employed to estimate costs. After 3 months, 21.5% of those receiving clobazam were drop-seizure-free. Over a 3-month horizon, clobazam was more effective and less expensive than comparators, with the assumption that >0.77% of drop seizures required medical care. Below this threshold, topiramate was less costly than clobazam. With the base-case assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures were medically attended, costs for patients receiving clobazam totaled $30,147 versus $34,223-$35,378 for comparators. Clobazam was more efficacious and less costly than rufinamide over a 2-year horizon. The percentage of medically attended drop seizures was a driver of results. Clobazam treatment may be cost-saving.

"	"Polymicrogyria is caused by a diverse etiology, one of which is gene mutation. At present, only one gene (GPR56) is known to cause polymicrogyria, which leads to a distinctive phenotype termed bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is an autosomal recessive inherited human brain malformation with abnormal cortical lamination. Here, we identified compound heterozygous GPR56 mutations in a patient with BFPP. The proband was a Japanese female born from non-consanguineous parents. She presented with mental retardation, developmental motor delay, epilepsy exhibiting the feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, exotropia, bilateral polymicrogyria with a relatively spared perisylvian region, bilateral patchy-white-matter MRI signal changes, and hypoplastic pontine basis. GPR56 sequence analysis revealed a c.107G>A substitution leading to a p.S36N, and a c.113G>A leading to a p.R38Q. Although affected individuals with compound heterozygosity in GPR56 have not been previously described, we presume that compound heterozygosity of these two mutations in a ligand binding domain within the extracellular N-terminus of protein could result in BFPP. In addition, we observed unusually less involvement of perisylvian cortex for polymicrogyria, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for epilepsy, which are likely common features in patients with BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations.

The expression of the gene in patient fibroblasts was not affected but the protein level was significantly reduced, suggesting that protein stability was affected by this mutation. The lower protein level also affected assembly of complex I and supercomplexes (I/III2 /IV and I/III2 ), leading to complex I deficiency. While ATP levels at steady state under stress conditions were not affected, the amount of ROS produced by complex I was significantly increased.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic disorder with characteristic electroclinical features but diverse etiologies. The shared electroclinical characteristics suggest that common cerebral networks are involved in generating seizures. We sought to reveal these networks by comparing ictal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We identified 10 ictal-interictal SPECT pairs from seven patients with LGS (median age 11 years; range 1-38) who were studied during video electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed tonic seizures. We performed a voxel-wise comparison of ictal and interictal SPECT studies across the group. The evolution of blood flow changes was explored by examining early and late injection groups. Median duration of tonic seizures was 10 s (range 6-29 s), and injection latency from seizure offset was -8 to 48 s. In the early injection group (<10 s; three studies), there was hyperperfusion over pons and cerebellar hemispheres (p < 0.05 cluster corrected family wise error), and hypoperfusion bilaterally over the pericentral region, with a trend toward hyperperfusion over bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri, and lateral parietal cortex. In the late injection group, there was hyperperfusion over midline and lateral cerebellar regions, with hypoperfusion widely over bilateral frontal regions. This study suggests that the tonic seizures of LGS result from activity in a network, containing bilateral frontal and parietal association areas and the pons. We postulate that tonic seizures recruit the corticoreticular system, which connects frontal attentional areas to the pontine reticular formation, and is normally responsible for postural tone and orienting behavior.

We evaluated retrospectively eight symptomatic patients with epilepsy with late-onset ES. All patients underwent video-EEG analysis for more than 24 hours and have been followed up for at least 1 year.

All patients exhibited neurological deterioration and had multiple seizure types; seven of them had intractable seizures. Interictal EEG showed no typical hypsarrhythmia in any case. Ictal EMG analysis revealed that the predominant seizure types presenting with the tonic component were distributed among ES, spasms followed by tonic seizures (SFT), and tonic seizures. The clinical characteristics of our patients were identical to infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. Our patients had ES, SFT, and tonic seizures as the core seizure types, developed ES beyond the age of 1 year, and showed neurological deterioration.

The survey was presented to parents belonging to a Facebook group dedicated to sharing information about the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to treat their child's seizures. Nineteen responses met the following inclusion criteria for the study: a diagnosis of epilepsy and current use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. Thirteen children had Dravet syndrome, four had Doose syndrome, and one each had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and idiopathic epilepsy. The average number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) tried before using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis was 12. Sixteen (84%) of the 19 parents reported a reduction in their child's seizure frequency while taking cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. Of these, two (11%) reported complete seizure freedom, eight (42%) reported a greater than 80% reduction in seizure frequency, and six (32%) reported a 25-60% seizure reduction. Other beneficial effects included increased alertness, better mood, and improved sleep. Side effects included drowsiness and fatigue. Our survey shows that parents are using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis as a treatment for their children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Because of the increasing number of states that allow access to medical cannabis, its use will likely be a growing concern for the epilepsy community. Safety and tolerability data for cannabidiol-enriched cannabis use among children are not available.

24553310	"Combined use of multiple computational intracranial EEG analysis techniques for the localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Traditionally, identification of epileptogenic zones primarily relied on visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings by experienced epileptologists; however, removal of epileptogenic zones identified by iEEG does not always guarantee favorable surgical outcomes. To confirm visual inspection results, and assist in making decisions about surgical resection areas, computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been used for the localization of epileptogenic zones. In this study, we have proposed a new approach for the localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and have investigated whether the proposed approach could confirm surgical resection areas and predict seizure outcome before surgery. The proposed approach simultaneously used results of 2 iEEG analysis methods, directed transfer function (DTF) and time delay estimation, to enhance localization accuracy. This new combined method was applied to patients who became seizure-free after resective epilepsy surgery, as well as those who had unsuccessful surgery. A quantitative metric was also introduced that can measure how well the localized epileptogenic zones coincided with the surgical resection areas, with the aim of verifying whether the approach could confirm surgical resection areas determined by epileptologists. The estimated epileptogenic zones more strongly coincided with surgical resection areas in patients with successful, compared to those with unsuccessful surgical outcomes. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that the combined use of 2 iEEG analyses resulted in a more accurate estimate of epileptogenic zones in LGS than the use of a single method. A combination of multiple iEEG analyses could not only enhance overall accuracy of localizing epileptogenic zones in LGS, but also has the potential to predict outcomes before resective surgery.

"	"To determine long-term safety and efficacy of adjunctive clobazam for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Eligible patients from two randomized controlled trials (Phase II OV-1002 and Phase III OV-1012) were able to enroll in open-label extension (OLE) study OV-1004 beginning in December 2005 and received clobazam until they discontinued (mandatory at 2 years for patients outside the United States) or until study completion in March 2012. Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6 years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting. Of 267 patients who enrolled in the OLE, 188 (70%) completed the trial. Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for >2 years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5 years, and 11 for 6 years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a ≥50% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure-free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure-free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were ""very much improved"" or ""much improved"" after 3 years. Of the 43 patients with concomitant AED data who were treated for 5 years, 30% increased, 19% decreased, and 51% had no change in numbers of AEDs versus their Week 4 regimens. The mean modal clobazam dosage was 0.90 mg/kg/day at Year 1 and 0.97 mg/kg/day at Year 5, suggesting that study patients did not need significant increases in dosage over time. The safety profile was what would be expected for clobazam for LGS patients over a 5-year span, and no new safety concerns developed over time. In this largest and longest-running trial in LGS, adjunctive clobazam sustained seizure freedom and substantial seizure improvements at stable dosages through 3 years of therapy in this difficult- to-treat patient population.

"	"Atypical benign partial epilepsy/pseudo-Lennox syndrome (ABPE/PLS) and continues spike and wave during sleep (CSWS) belong to a spectrum of idiopathic focal epilepsy syndromes ranging from benign Rolandic epilepsy to more severe seizure disorders, which are commonly characterized by the association of various epileptic seizure types, aggravation of spike-wave discharges during slow sleep, and cognitive and/or behavioral disturbances. The Aim of our study was to evaluate the risk factors that influence cognitive outcome in patients with ABPE/PLS and CSWS in a retrospective analysis. Thirty patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ABPE/PLS and 12 for CSWS and were chosen for the descriptive analysis. Cognitive achievement was evaluated according to psychological tests and school performances. Severe global and specific cognitive disturbances occurred almost regularly in cases of ABPE. Already at the time of epilepsy presentation the level of cognitive performance was lower than that of the normal population. At the time of disease presentation only 56% of the children had IQ within the standard range (≥85). We observed that the level of cognitive developmental delay did not change significantly during the disease process. We were not able to observe any statistically significant connection between the development of EEG abnormalities and cognitive development. The conclusion can be drawn that many patients exhibit cognitive impairment at disease presentation which is not affected significantly during the treatment process. Judging from the observed data, we assume that EEG abnormalities, duration of active epilepsy, and antiepileptic medication have less influence on the cognitive development than was previously assumed.

24614520	"CHD2 mutations in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy with a heterogeneous etiology. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of CHD2 in LGS, as CHD2 mutations have been described recently in various epileptic encephalopathies. We have previously identified one patient with a large deletion affecting the CHD2 gene in a group of 22 patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. In the remaining 17 patients without known etiology, Sanger sequencing revealed a de novo 1-bp duplication in the CHD2 gene in another patient. This mutation leads to a frameshift and, consequently, a premature stop codon 49bp downstream of the mutation. The patient had prominent myoclonic seizures and photosensitivity, thus, sharing phenotypic features with previously reported patients with CHD2-related epilepsy. In our original material of 22 patients with LGS features, we have now found two (9%) with mutations in the CHD2 gene. Our findings suggest that CHD2 mutations are important in the etiological spectrum of LGS.

24630492	"Localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) using graph theoretical analysis of ictal intracranial EEG: a preliminary investigation
"	"Precise localization of epileptogenic zones is essential for the successful surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The surgical resection areas are generally determined by epileptologists based on diverse neuroimaging modalities; however, exact epileptogenic zones cannot be accurately localized in many patients with LGS using the conventional methods. Therefore, new reliable algorithms are still required for enhancing the success rate of the resective epilepsy surgery. In the present study, we introduce an approach to localize epileptogenic zones in LGS based on the graph theoretical analysis of ical intracranial EEG (iEEG). Four patients with LGS who became seizure-free after the resective epilepsy surgery were selected. Before the surgery, their epileptogenic zones were delineated using EEG, iEEG, and several conventional imaging modalities. Phase locking value (PLV) analysis was applied to construct functional connectivity networks during ictal events, and then several graph theoretical indices including betweenness centrality (BC) were evaluated for each iEEG sensor to find the primary hubs of the ictal epileptic network. The graph theoretical index values were then overlaid on 3D individual cortical surface. The iEEG channels with high BC values coincided well with the surgical resection areas. Among various graph theoretical measures such as local efficiency, participation coefficient, and eigenvector centrality, only BC showed fair correspondence with the surgical resection areas. The primary hubs in the ictal epileptic networks coincided well with areas of surgical resection in LGS patients with successful surgical outcomes. This observation warrants further studies to determine if the graph theoretical network analysis of ictal iEEG recordings can serve as a new auxiliary tool to localize epileptogenic zones in LGS.

Although accumulating evidence supports a working mechanism through voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels, we found that a clinically relevant rufinamide concentration inhibits human (h)Nav1.1 activation, a distinct working mechanism among anticonvulsants and a feature worth exploring for treating a growing number of debilitating disorders involving hNav1.1. Subsequent structure-activity relationship experiments with related N-benzyl triazole compounds on four brain hNav channel isoforms revealed a novel drug variant that (1) shifts hNav1.1 opening to more depolarized voltages without further alterations in the gating properties of hNav1.1, hNav1.2, hNav1.3, and hNav1.6; (2) increases the threshold to action potential initiation in hippocampal neurons; and (3) greatly reduces the frequency of seizures in three animal models. Altogether, our results provide novel molecular insights into the rational development of Nav channel-targeting molecules based on the unique rufinamide scaffold, an outcome that may be exploited to design drugs for treating disorders involving particular Nav channel isoforms while limiting adverse effects.

However, there is a lack of data regarding the efficacy in pediatric intractable epilepsies other than LGS. The purpose of the study was to explore the efficacy and tolerability of RUF in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS. This retrospective observation study was conducted in Samsung medical center from August 2010 to September 2011. Thirty seven patients (27 males, 10 females, aged between 1.8 and 18.4 years), with refractory epilepsies or LGS were treated with RUF as an adjunctive drug. Efficacy was represented by the response rate and retention rate over the study period. Tolerability was measured as the number of patients who showed adverse effects. The overall response rate was 21.6% during the 12 months of the study period with 5.4% of seizure-free patients. The retention rate was 54% and ineffectiveness was the most common reason for discontinuation of RUF. The most common adverse effects were insomnia and somnolence. RUF may be considered to be an efficacious and safe AED for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS.

Efflux of antiepileptic drugs due to increased expression/function of P-glycoprotein, a multidrug efflux transporter protein on the cell surface is a proposed mechanism. The authors studied the expression/function of P-glycoprotein on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 29 children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 23 children with other epilepsies, and 19 healthy children. The authors found a higher P-glycoprotein expression/function in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a higher percent positive cells as compared to children with other epilepsy (P < 0.001) and to healthy controls (P = 0.012), higher P-glycoprotein expression as compared to healthy controls (P = 0.003), a higher total P-glycoprotein expression (relative florescence intensity × percent positive cells) as compared to children with other epilepsies (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.001), and a higher P-glycoprotein function as compared to children with other epilepsies (P = 0.001) and healthy controls (P = 0.002).

We previously found common cerebral networks involved during slow spike-and-wave (SSW) and generalized paroxysmal fast activity (PFA), characteristic interictal discharges. Some patients have a Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype and cortical lesions. We wished to explore the interaction between cerebral networks and lesions in this group. 3 Tesla electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) on six subjects with Lennox-Gastaut phenotype and a structural lesion. Timings of SSW and PFA events were used in an event-related fMRI analysis, and to estimate the time course of the hemodynamic response from key regions. (1) PFA-robust fMRI signal increases were observed in frontal and parietal association cortical areas, thalamus, and pons, with simultaneous increases in both ""attention"" and resting-state (default mode) networks, a highly unusual pattern. (2) SSW showed mixed increased and decreased fMRI activity, with preevent increases in association cortex and thalamus, and then prominent postevent reduction. There was decreased fMRI activity in primary cortical areas. (3) Lesion-variable fMRI increases were observed during PFA and SSW discharges. Three subjects who proceeded to lesionectomy are >1 year seizure-free. We conceptualize Lennox-Gastaut phenotype as a being a network epilepsy, where key cerebral networks become autonomously unstable. Epileptiform activity in Lennox-Gastaut phenotype, and by implication in LGS, appears to be amplified and expressed through association cortical areas, possibly because the attention and default-mode networks are widely interconnected, fundamental brain networks. Seizure freedom in the subjects who proceeded to lesionectomy suggests that cortical lesions are able to establish and maintain this abnormal unstable network behavior. LGS may be considered a secondary network epilepsy because the unifying epileptic manifestations of the disorder, including PFA and SSW, reflect network dysfunction, rather than the specific initiating process.

Patients with LGS (4 to 30 years old) taking between one and three antiepileptic drugs were recruited. After the baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to rufinamide or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days. Of the 59 patients, 29 were randomized to the rufinamide group and 30 to the placebo group. The frequency of epileptic seizures was significantly decreased in the rufinamide group than in the placebo group; the median percent change in frequency of tonic-atonic seizures was -24.2% and -3.3%, respectively, (p=0.003) and that of total seizures was -32.9% and -3.1%, respectively (p<0.001).

"	"Emerging evidence indicates that epileptic encephalopathies are genetically highly heterogeneous, underscoring the need for large cohorts of well-characterized individuals to further define the genetic landscape. Through a collaboration between two consortia (EuroEPINOMICS and Epi4K/EPGP), we analyzed exome-sequencing data of 356 trios with the ""classical"" epileptic encephalopathies, infantile spasms and Lennox Gastaut syndrome, including 264 trios previously analyzed by the Epi4K/EPGP consortium. In this expanded cohort, we find 429 de novo mutations, including de novo mutations in DNM1 in five individuals and de novo mutations in GABBR2, FASN, and RYR3 in two individuals each. Unlike previous studies, this cohort is sufficiently large to show a significant excess of de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy probands compared to the general population using a likelihood analysis (p = 8.2 × 10(-4)), supporting a prominent role for de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies. We bring statistical evidence that mutations in DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathy, find suggestive evidence for a role of three additional genes, and show that at least 12% of analyzed individuals have an identifiable causal de novo mutation. Strikingly, 75% of mutations in these probands are predicted to disrupt a protein involved in regulating synaptic transmission, and there is a significant enrichment of de novo mutations in genes in this pathway in the entire cohort as well. These findings emphasize an important role for synaptic dysregulation in epileptic encephalopathies, above and beyond that caused by ion channel dysfunction.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy of childhood with a heterogeneous etiology. Recently, genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of new de novo mutations associated with this epileptic syndrome. Herein, we report an 8-year-old child with intellectual disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, Rett-like features, and LGS, carrying a de novo missense mutation in the forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene. This gene is responsible for FOXG1 syndrome, characterized by severe postnatal microcephaly, moderate postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation with poor social interaction, stereotyped behavior and dyskinesias, absent language, sleep disorders, and epilepsy. Nonspecific epilepsy syndromes have been associated with this genetic disorder. Thus, we hypothesize that FOXG1 might be a new candidate gene in the etiology of LGS and suggest screening for this gene in cases of LGS with concomitant microcephaly and clinical features overlapping with Rett syndrome.

"	"Our aim was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam as an add-on treatment in pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The study was an open-label, multicenter, observational clinical trial of levetiracetam as an add-on treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Fifty-five patients aged 1.1-18.6 years (mean, 10.0 years) were enrolled. The study included a 4-8-week titration period and an 8-week maintenance period. The maintenance dose of levetiracetam was 20-80 mg/kg/day, according to its effectiveness and tolerability. The primary end point was reduction in seizure frequency, and related variables were also evaluated. Among 55 patents, 51 patients (92.7%) completed the study. Thirty-two patients (58.2%) experienced a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 15 patients (27.3%) became seizure free. A reduction in seizure frequency of more than 50% was observed in 21 of 36 patients (58.3%) with convulsive seizures, 7 of 12 patients (58.3%) with drop attacks, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with myoclonic seizures, and 2 of 3 patients (66.7%) with epileptic spasms. Overall, 34.5% of patients reported adverse events. None of the adverse events were life threatening, and the most common adverse event was hyperactivity (12.7%). This study suggests that levetiracetam is a safe and effective treatment in pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) severity varies considerably, so the potential impact of differences in baseline severity on patient outcome following treatment is clinically informative. Here, two surrogate indicators of LGS severity (baseline seizure frequency and vagus nerve stimulation [VNS] use) were used in post hoc analyses of both short- and long-term clobazam trials (Phase III OV-1012 [CONTAIN] and open-label extension [OLE] OV-1004). In CONTAIN, 217 patients comprised the modified, intention-to-treat population. Each baseline seizure-frequency quartile had ~40 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure frequency ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-30 (Quartile 2), 32-86 (Quartile 3), and 86-1077 (Quartile 4). Mean percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar for all quartiles. More than 50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly drop- and total-seizure frequency. The percentage of patients achieving 100% reduction in drop seizures was 33% for clobazam-treated patients (vs. 7% for placebo) in Quartile 1. Five percent of clobazam-treated patients in Quartile 4 (most severe LGS) vs. 0% for placebo achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures. A total of 267 of 306 possible patients entered the OLE (61/68 from a Phase II study and 206/238 from Phase III CONTAIN). Each quartile had ~66 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-31 (Quartile 2), 32-110 (Quartile 3), and 111-1147 (Quartile 4). Median percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar between quartiles. Through 5 years of therapy, >50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly frequency for drop seizures. More than 12% of patients in Quartile 4 achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures from Month 3 through Year 5. For the VNS analyses in CONTAIN, the least-squares mean decreases in average weekly rate of drop seizures (mITT population) were 52% for VNS patients receiving clobazam vs. -22% for placebo (p < 0.01). For non-VNS patients, these percentages were 53% for clobazam and 26% for placebo (p < 0.01). Moreover, 50% and 54% of clobazam-treated patients in the VNS and non-VNS groups demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in average weekly drop- and total-seizure frequencies, and 11% and 14% in the two groups achieved drop-seizure freedom, respectively. Analyses using baseline seizure frequency and VNS use as surrogates for disease severity showed that clobazam treatment of patients with less severe or severe LGS was equally efficacious.

25511520	"Clinical considerations in transitioning patients with epilepsy from clonazepam to clobazam: a case series
"	"In treating refractory epilepsy, many clinicians are interested in methods used to transition patients receiving clonazepam to clobazam to maintain or increase seizure control, improve tolerability of patients' overall drug therapy regimens, and to enhance quality of life for patients and their families. However, no published guidelines assist clinicians in successfully accomplishing this change safely. The following three case reports provide insight into the transition from clonazepam to clobazam. First, an 8-year-old Caucasian boy with cryptogenic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome beginning at 3.5 years of age, who was experiencing multiple daily generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and tonic seizures at presentation. Second, a 25-year-old, left-handed, White Hispanic man with moderate mental retardation and medically refractory seizures that he began experiencing at 1 year of age, secondary to tuberous sclerosis. When first presented to an epilepsy center, he had been receiving levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam, but reported having ongoing and frequent seizures. Third, a 69-year-old Korean woman who had been healthy until she had a stroke in 2009 with subsequent right hemiparesis; as a result, she became less physically and socially active, and had her first convulsive seizure approximately 4 months after the stroke. From these cases, we observe that a rough estimate of final clobazam dosage for each mg of clonazepam under substitution is likely to be at least 10-fold, probably closer to 15-fold for many patients, and as high as 20-fold for a few. Consideration and discussion of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and clinical properties of 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepine action provide a rationale on why and how these transitions were successful.

25530452	"Dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and brain penetration of rufinamide following intravenous and oral administration to rats
"	"Rufinamide is a third-generation antiepileptic drug, approved recently as an orphan drug for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although extensive research was conducted, its pharmacokinetics in rats was not described. This work addresses that area by describing in a rapid pharmacokinetic study the main pharmacokinetic properties of rufinamide at three different doses of 1 mg/kg body weight (bw), 5 mg/kg bw, and 20 mg/kg bw. Furthermore, total brain concentrations of the drug were determined in order to characterize its brain-to-plasma partition coefficient. Adult Wistar male rats, weighing 200-450 g, were administered rufinamide by intravenous and oral routes. Rufinamide concentrations from plasma samples and brain tissue homogenate were determined using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric method and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The mean half-life was between 7 and 13 h, depending on route of administration--intravenously administered drug was eliminated faster than orally administered drug. Mean (S.E.M.) total plasma clearance was 84.01 ± 3.80 ml/h/kg for intravenous administration, while the apparent plasma clearance for oral administration was 95.52 ± 39.45 ml/h/kg. The mean (S.E.M.) maximum plasma concentration reached after oral administration of 1 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw was 0.89 ± 0.09 μg/ml and 3.188 ± 0.71 μg/ml, respectively. The median (range) time to reach maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) was 4 (2-8)h. Mean (S.E.M.) brain-to-plasma concentration ratio of rufinamide was 0.514 ± 0.036, consistent with the brain-to-plasma ratio calculated from the area under curves (AUC(0-t)) of 0.441 ± 0.047. No influence of dose, route of administration, or post-dosing time was observed on brain-to-plasma ratio.

25619447	"A granulocytosis associated with rufinamide: A case report
"	"Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) chemically unrelated to other current AEDs. Previous studies on pediatric epilepsy treatment with rufinamide have demonstrated a frequency of leukopenia as an adverse event of 0.5%, and there has been no report of the development of agranulocytosis. Here, we report a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who developed agranulocytosis associated with fever and skin rash with rufinamide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of agranulocytosis induced by rufinamide. A 10-year-old boy with a history of herpes encephalitis at the age of 1 year developed LGS, and was administered rufinamide as add-on therapy to valproate, lamotrigine, and clonazepam because of difficulties in controlling tonic seizures. Eighteen days after initiation of rufinamide, agranulocytosis developed associated with high fever and skin rash, all of which resolved after withdrawal of rufinamide. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normocellular marrow with selective decrease of mature myeloid series, and suggested that agranulocytosis was not related to malignancy or serious infection. This case suggests that rufinamide may induce the potentially serious adverse effect of agranulocytosis. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs of agranulocytosis and consideration should be given to routine blood count determination for early detection of this.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy, and is characterized by frequent and difficult to treat seizures associated with mental retardation. The case is presented of a 21 year-old male with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with bilateral cervical facet joint dislocation fracture at C6-C7 and spinal canal compression as a result of a fall during a seizure. In this case the management of the difficult airway expected in an awake and uncooperative patient, with cervical spinal cord injury is described. An airway management strategy was proposed, that allowed a rapid and safe airway control with the best possible tolerance and maintaining the neck immobilised, so as not to increase neurological injury. Within this strategy, plan A was defined as inhalation induction with sevoflurane to maintain spontaneous breathing and tracheal intubation with Airtraq®. We believe that the Airtraq® video laryngoscope with inhalational induction with sevoflurane is a valid and effective alternative in the management of expected difficult airway.

"	"This article aims to report the first clinical experiences concerning effectiveness and tolerability of perampanel (PER) in a pediatric population with refractory epilepsies. This nonsponsored, observational, retrospective survey was conducted through collaboration with multiple centers in Europe. The clinical course of the first pediatric patients treated in these centers with PER was documented with the help of a questionnaire completed by the treating physicians. Effectiveness and adverse effects were evaluated. The study population consisted of 58 patients (mean age, 10.5 years; range, 2-17 years), suffering from various refractory epilepsies, classified as focal epilepsy (n = 36), unclassified generalized epilepsy (n = 12), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 5), West syndrome (n = 3), and Dravet syndrome (n = 2). The response rate (≥ 50% seizure reduction) after the first 3 months of therapy was 31% (18/58 patients) in total. Complete seizure control was achieved in five patients (9% overall). Aggravation of seizures occurred in five cases (9%). The most frequently occurring adverse effects were reduced vigilance or fatigue (n = 16) and behavioral changes (n = 14). PER seems to be effective also in children and adolescents with pharmaco-refractory epilepsies. Tolerability was acceptable.

"	"Oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) have been used in the treatment of epilepsy; however, no studies demonstrate clear efficacy. We report on a cohort of pediatric patients with epilepsy who were given OCE and followed in a single tertiary epilepsy center. A retrospective chart review of children and adolescents who were given OCE for treatment of their epilepsy was performed. Seventy-five patients were identified of which 57% reported any improvement in seizure control and 33% reported a >50% reduction in seizures (responders). If the family had moved to CO for OCE treatment, the responder rate was 47% vs. 22% for children who already were in CO. The responder rate varied based on epilepsy syndrome: Dravet 23%, Doose 0%, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 88.9%. The background EEG of the 8 responders where EEG data were available was not improved. Additional benefits reported included: improved behavior/alertness (33%), improved language (10%), and improved motor skills (10%). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% of patients including increased seizures (13%) and somnolence/fatigue (12%). Rare adverse events included developmental regression, abnormal movements, status epilepticus requiring intubation, and death. Our retrospective study of OCE use in pediatric patients with epilepsy demonstrates that some families reported patient improvement with treatment; however, we also found a variety of challenges and possible confounding factors in studying OCE retrospectively in an open-labeled fashion. We strongly support the need for controlled, blinded studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCE for treatment of pediatric epilepsies using accurate seizure counts, formal neurocognitive assessments, as well as EEG as a biomarker. This study provides Class III evidence that OCE is well tolerated by children and adolescents with epilepsy.

"	"To evaluate the effectiveness of rufinamide (RFM) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) compared to those with other epilepsy syndromes using time to treatment failure (retention rate) as the outcome measure. In this retrospective cohort study, characteristics and outcomes of all patients receiving RFM in 2009 and 2010 were recorded. The primary outcome measure was RFM failure, defined as discontinuation of RFM or initiation of an additional antiepileptic therapy. The secondary outcome measure was discontinuation of RFM. Kaplan-Meier method survival curves were generated for time to RFM failure, for all patients and by the presence or absence of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The impact of age, seizure type, fast or slow drug titration, and concomitant therapy with valproate on retention rate were evaluated using Cox regression models. One hundred thirty-three patients were included, 39 (30%) of whom had LGS. For all patients, the probability of remaining on RFM without additional therapy was 45% at 12 months and 30% at 24 months. LGS diagnosis was an independent predictor of time to RFM failure (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.83), with a median time to failure of 18 months in LGS compared to 6 months in all others (p=0.006). In a broad population of children with refractory epilepsy, around half will continue taking the medication for at least a year without additional therapy. Patients with LGS are two times more likely to continue RFM without additional therapy compared to those without LGS.

25890840	"Epileptic activity during early postnatal life in the AY-9944 model of atypical absence epilepsy
"	"Atypical absence epilepsy (AAE) is an intractable disorder characterized by slow spike-and-wave discharges in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and accompanied by severe cognitive dysfunction and neurodevelopmental or neurological deficits in humans. Administration of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor AY-9944 (AY) during the postnatal developmental period induces AAE in animals; however, the neural mechanism of seizure development remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the cellular manifestations of AY-induced AAE in the mouse. Treatment of brain slices with AY increased membrane excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons. AY treatment also increased input resistance of CA1 neurons during early postnatal days (PND) 5-10. However, these effects were not observed during late PND (14-21) or in adulthood (7-10 weeks). Notably, AY treatment elicited paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS)-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period, but not during late PND or in adults. The PDS-like events were not compromised by application of glutamate or GABA receptor antagonists. However, the PDS-like events were abolished by blockage of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Hippocampal neurons isolated from an in vivo AY model of AAE showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. Further, AY-treated neurons from T-type Ca(2+) channel α1G knockout (Cav3.1(-/-)) mice, which do not exhibit typical absence seizures, showed similar PDS-like epileptiform discharges. These results demonstrate that PDS-like epileptiform discharges during the early postnatal period are dependent upon Na(+) channels and are involved in the generation of AY-induced AAE, which is distinct from typical absence epilepsy. Our findings may aid our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of clinical AAE in individuals, such as those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"There is a great need for safe and effective therapies for treatment of infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Based on anecdotal reports and limited experience in an open-label trial, cannabidiol (CBD) has received tremendous attention as a potential treatment for pediatric epilepsy, especially Dravet syndrome. However, there is scant evidence of specific utility for treatment of IS and LGS. We sought to document the experiences of children with IS and/or LGS who have been treated with CBD-enriched cannabis preparations. We conducted a brief online survey of parents who administered CBD-enriched cannabis preparations for the treatment of their children's epilepsy. We specifically recruited parents of children with IS and LGS and focused on perceived efficacy, dosage, and tolerability. Survey respondents included 117 parents of children with epilepsy (including 53 with IS or LGS) who had administered CBD products to their children. Perceived efficacy and tolerability were similar across etiologic subgroups. Eighty-five percent of all parents reported a reduction in seizure frequency, and 14% reported complete seizure freedom. Epilepsy was characterized as highly refractory with median latency from epilepsy onset to CBD initiation of five years, during which the patient's seizures failed to improve after a median of eight antiseizure medication trials. The median duration and the median dosage of CBD exposure were 6.8 months and 4.3mg/kg/day, respectively. Reported side effects were far less common during CBD exposure, with the exception of increased appetite (30%). A high proportion of respondents reported improvement in sleep (53%), alertness (71%), and mood (63%) during CBD therapy. Although this study suggests a potential role for CBD in the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy including IS and LGS, it does not represent compelling evidence of efficacy or safety. From a methodological standpoint, this study is extraordinarily vulnerable to participation bias and limited by lack of blinded outcome ascertainment. Appropriately controlled clinical trials are essential to establish efficacy and safety.

"	"The peak age at onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is between 3 and 5years. Patients with LGS frequently experience multiple types of treatment-refractory seizures and require lifelong therapy with several antiepileptic drugs. Here, post hoc analyses of clinical trials (phase III trial OV-1012 and open-label extension trial OV-1004) provide short- and long-term efficacy and safety data of adjunctive clobazam in patients with LGS stratified by age at baseline (≥2 to <12years, ≥12 to <17years, and ≥17years). In OV-1012, 301 patients were screened, 238 were randomized, 217 comprised the modified intention-to-treat population, and 177 completed the study. A total of 267/306 patients (61 of 68 from phase II trial OV-1002 and 206 of 238 from phase III trial OV-1012) entered the open-label extension trial. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between different age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. No differences in efficacy or adverse events were observed across age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. The results of these post hoc analyses show that adjunctive clobazam over the short and longterm was similarly effective and well-tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients with LGS.

26036975	"Rufinamide Improves Functional and Behavioral Deficits via Blockade of Tetrodotoxin-Resistant Sodium Channels in Diabetic Neuropathy
"	"Rufinamide is a structurally novel, antiepileptic drug approved for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) with possible membrane-stabilizing effects. VGSCs play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we investigated the effects of rufinamide on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium current (TTX-R I(Na)) in acutely dissociated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by using whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration. In addition, the functional and behavioural nociceptive parameters were evaluated to assess its potential in diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic rats demonstrated the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia with reduced nerve perfusion and conduction velocity as compared to control. Rufinamide treatments (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly improved these functional and nociceptive deficits. Diabetic rat DRG neurons exhibited increased TTX-R I(Na) density as compared to control. The voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation curves for TTX-R I(Na) in DRG neurons from diabetic rats were shifted negatively as compared to control. Rufinamide treatments significantly blocked the TTX-R Na+ channel activity as evident from significant reduction in I(Na) density and hyperpolarizing shift in activation and inactivation curves as compared to diabetic control. This suggests that rufinamide acts on TTX-R Na+ channels, reduces channel activity and attenuates nerve functional and behavioral parameters in diabetic rats. Altogether, these results indicate therapeutic potential of rufinamide in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

For at least 6 months, 14/42 responded to the addition of the ketogenic diet: 4/23 with WS, 8/13 with CSWS, and 2/6 with miscellaneous epileptic encephalopathies. The addition of the KD allowed withdrawing steroids in all responders. Among them, 10/15 had been patients with steroid-dependent epileptic encephalopathy and 4/27 patients with steroid-resistant epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, the ketogenic diet can be used successfully in combination with corticosteroids for epileptic encephalopathies. Patients presenting with steroid-dependent CSWS seem to be the best candidates.

26093133	"Hypokalemia in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"The Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy. Incidence: 1/1.000.000/year, prevalence: 15/100.000. LGS covers 5-10% of epileptic patients and 1-2% of childhood epilepsies. Also referred to as cryptogenic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy. LGS is characterized by: multiple seizures (atypical absences, axial tonic seizures and sudden atonic or myoclonic falls), diffuse slow cryptic EEG waves when awake (<3 Hz), fast rhythmic peaks (10 Hz) during sleep, mental retardation and personality disorders. The LGS is not responding to treatment. Some new drugs have proven to be effective in controlling the disease (Felbamate, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Levetiracetam). The mortality rate is about 5%; only rarely death is due to epilepsy, which is usually caused by stroke or epileptic episodes. Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old female patient with LGS, severe hypokalemia, mental retardation and focal seizures. Normal renal function: creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 96 ml/min, serum potassium levels to the minimum: 3.5 mEq/L. This level of potassium, however, had been achieved with the assumption of 8 oral tablets/day of potassium chloride. Osmotic diuresis, use of diuretics, Bartter, Gitelman (normal urinary calcium and magnesium) and pseudo-Bartter syndromes were all excluded whereas aldosteronism was found. Our findings lead to hypokalemia related to assumption of topiramate and hyperaldosteronism. Reduction in drug intake was not effective due to the increased seizures, so the drug was maintained, along with potassium supplementation. In conclusion, the patient has been diagnosed with hypokalemia and iatrogenic hyperaldosteronism, rare in our outpatient practice.

"	"About one-half of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have history of birth hypoxia or other perinatal event but the knowledge about clinical, radiological profile and severity of epilepsy in these children as compared to those without a perinatal event is not known. Thirty-one children with LGS were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups: One group with the perinatal event and other group without evidence of the perinatal event. We hypothesized that LGS with the perinatal event will have an early age of onset of LGS, more motor deficits and abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and more severe epilepsy. There were 17 children in the perinatal event group and 14 in the other group. The mean age of onset of illness was significantly earlier in the perinatal event group (P < 0.05). More children in the perinatal event group had delayed milestones (P < 0.05), had higher seizure frequency (P < 0.05) however; there was no significant difference in number of anti-epileptic drugs consumed, motor deficits or MRI abnormalities. LGS children with the perinatal event have more severe epilepsy with early onset of disease and delayed milestones. History of perinatal insult in these children may help in predicting prognosis in LGS.

To characterize potential DDIs with clobazam, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 153 patients with LGS in study OV-1012 (NCT00518713) and 18 healthy participants in bioavailability study OV-1017 were pooled. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were grouped based on their effects on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes responsible for the metabolism of clobazam and its metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB): CYP3A inducers (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), CYP2C19 inducers (valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), or CYP2C19 inhibitors (felbamate, oxcarbazepine). CYP3A4 inducers-which did not affect the oral clearance of clobazam-significantly increased the formation of N-CLB by 9.4%, while CYP2C19 inducers significantly increased the apparent elimination rate of N-CLB by 10.5%, resulting in a negligible net change in the PK of the active metabolite. CYP2C19 inhibitors did not affect N-CLB elimination. Because concomitant use of AEDs that are either CYP450 inhibitors or inducers with clobazam in the treatment of LGS patients had negligible to no effect on clobazam PK in this study, dosage adjustments may not be required for clobazam in the presence of the AEDs investigated here.

26245776	"Clobazam and Aggression-Related Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is an intractable epileptic encephalopathy marked by frequent drop seizures. Most patients develop moderate intellectual disability and behavioral problems, including hyperactivity, aggressiveness, insecurity, and autistic features. Treatment with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may increase aggression/behavioral problems in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Post hoc analyses of data from the OV-1012 trial assessed the potential for behavioral effects with clobazam treatment in pediatric (2 to 18 years) patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. OV-1012 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial comprising a 4-week baseline period, 3-week titration period, and a 12-week maintenance period. Data from 194 patients were analyzed for a history of aggression/behavioral problems, occurrence of aggression-related adverse events, and by assessment of potential drug-related effects on four behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist. Twenty-nine aggression-related adverse events were reported for 27 (13.9%) patients. Similar percentages of clobazam-treated patients with and without a history of aggressive behavior experienced an aggression-related adverse event (16.7% versus 15.5%, respectively). In the medium- and high-dosage clobazam groups, onset of aggression-related adverse effects occurred within the 3-week titration period with 63.2% resolving by the end of the study. Aggression-related adverse event onset and resolution were similar for the low-dosage clobazam and placebo groups. Analysis of baseline to postbaseline T scores for the behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist indicated no significant differences between clobazam and placebo. Post hoc analyses indicate that the overall rate of aggression with clobazam treatment was low and dosage dependent. Clobazam treatment was effective in reducing drop seizures regardless of aggression experience.

To describe endoscopic-assisted complete corpus callosotomy combined with anterior, hippocampal, and posterior commissurotomy. Patients with drug refractory epilepsy having drop attacks as the predominant seizure type, bilateral abnormalities on imaging, and moderate to severe mental retardation were included. All underwent a complete workup (including magnetic resonance imaging). Patients (n = 16, mean age 11.4 ± 6.4 years, range 6-19 years) had a mean seizure frequency of 24.5 ± 19.8/days (range 1-60) and a mean intelligence quotient of 25.23 ± 10.71. All had syndromic diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, with the following etiologies: hypoxic insult (10), lissencephaly (2), bilateral band heterotropia (2), and microgyria and pachygyria (2). Surgery included complete callosotomy and the section of anterior and posterior commissure by microscopic approach through a mini craniotomy (11) and endoscopic-assisted approach (5). Complications included meningitis (1), hyperammonemic encephalopathy (2), and acute transient disconnection (5). There was no mortality or long-term morbidity. Mean follow-up was 18 ± 4.7 months (range 16-27 months). Drop attacks stopped in all. Seizure frequency/duration decreased >90% in 10 patients and >50% in 5 patients, and increased in 1 patient. All patients attained presurgical functional levels in 3 to 6 months. Child behavior checklist scores showed no deterioration. Parental questionnaires reported 90% satisfaction attributed to the control of drop attacks. The series was compared retrospectively with an age/sex-matched cohort (where a callosotomy only was performed), and showed better outcome for drop attacks (P < .003).

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can be successfully treated by resective surgery in patients with a primary epileptogenic zone. This study aimed to identify the primary epileptogenic zone based on the causal epileptic network using direct directed transfer function (dDTF) analysis. We reviewed the dDTF findings for generalized sharp and wave discharges (GSW) from the preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) of 12 LGS patients (group A) with unilateral focal pathology who were successfully treated with resective surgery. These findings were compared with preoperative dDTF findings for the GSW from 15 LGS patients with bilateral non-resectable pathology (group B) who exhibited persistent bilateral independent diffuse sharp and wave discharges, even after corpus callosotomy. The dDTF analysis of the GSW revealed concordant findings of localization or lateralization with the primary epileptogenic zone in 83.3% (10/12 cases) of group A patients and bilateral or multifocal localization in 93.3% (14/15) of group B patients (p<0.01). The regions identified by dDTF analysis were included in the resected areas of all patients in group A, and complete matches of the resected areas without other foci were observed in 7 patients (58.3%) in group A. The region of GSW most frequently identified by dDTF analysis was the frontal area, which was identified in 91.7% (11/12) of group A and in 100% of group B, while extra-frontal areas were identified in 36.1% and 24.5% of groups A and B, respectively. The dDTF analysis of GSW could provide additional information to identify resective surgery candidates for patients with LGS.

"	"To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lacosamide in adults with LGS in the clinical setting. The present report is a retrospective, open-label treatment study carried out from June 2013 to December 2014 at the National Institute of Colombia. Lacosamide was introduced as add-on therapy. All caregivers were instructed to initiate lacosamide at low doses (25-50mg) and gradually increasing it every 2 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated based on the reduction in the rate of each countable type of seizure. We also evaluated the retention rate for lacosamide as the number of days with lacosamide during follow-up. The tolerability was evaluated base on account the adverse events. We found that lacosamide only improves the seizure rate in three out of 19 patients with LGS, in two of them by more than 50%. The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the focal and tonic-clonic seizures. The most commonly reported adverse events were worsening of seizures, aggressiveness and irritability. Nine patients (47.4%) showed worsening of their behavior during the treatment with lacosamide. Lacosamide can exacerbate both, the tonic and astatic seizures, and the encephalopathy associated with this epileptic syndrome. However, it is interesting to consider the likelihood of suppression of generalized tonic-clonic and focal seizures. That is why; lacosamide could be an option after carefully balancing risks and benefits in each individual case.

"	"Dynamin 1 (DNM1) is a large guanosine triphosphatase involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In recent studies, de novo mutations in DNM1 have been identified in five individuals with epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, we report two patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathy possessing de novo DNM1 mutations. Using whole exome sequencing, we detected the novel mutation c.127G>A (p.Gly43Ser) in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and a recurrent mutation c.709C>T (p.Arg237Trp) in a patient with West syndrome. Structural consideration of DNM1 mutations revealed that both mutations would destabilize the G domain structure and impair nucleotide binding, dimer formation, and/or GTPase activity of the G domain. These and previous cases of DNM1 mutations were reviewed to verify the phenotypic spectrum. The main clinical features of DNM1 mutations include intractable seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Most cases showed development delay before the onset of seizures. A patient carrying p.Arg237Trp in this report showed a different developmental status from that of a previously reported case, together with characteristic extrapyramidal movement.

Recently, GABRB3 mutations have been identified in a few patients with infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We report the clinical and electrographic features of a novel case of GABRB3-related early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Our patient presented with neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, then developed pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by multiple seizure types from 3 months of age. Electroencephalography demonstrated ictal generalized and interictal multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Using a SureSelectXT custom multiple gene panel covering 48 early infantile epileptic encephalopathy/developmental delay genes, a novel de novo GABRB3 heterozygous missense mutation, c.860C>T (p.Thr287Ile), was identified and confirmed on Sanger sequencing. GABRB3 is an emerging cause of early-onset epilepsy. Novel genetic technologies, such as whole-exome/genome sequencing and multiple gene panels, will undoubtedly identify further cases, allowing more detailed electroclinical delineation of the GABRB3-related genotypic and phenotypic spectra.

26724101	"Cannabidiol in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy: an open-label interventional trial
"	"Almost a third of patients with epilepsy have a treatment-resistant form, which is associated with severe morbidity and increased mortality. Cannabis-based treatments for epilepsy have generated much interest, but scientific data are scarce. We aimed to establish whether addition of cannabidiol to existing anti-epileptic regimens would be safe, tolerated, and efficacious in children and young adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. In this open-label trial, patients (aged 1-30 years) with severe, intractable, childhood-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy, who were receiving stable doses of antiepileptic drugs before study entry, were enrolled in an expanded-access programme at 11 epilepsy centres across the USA. Patients were given oral cannabidiol at 2-5 mg/kg per day, up-titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day (dependent on study site). The primary objective was to establish the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol and the primary efficacy endpoint was median percentage change in the mean monthly frequency of motor seizures at 12 weeks. The efficacy analysis was by modified intention to treat. Comparisons of the percentage change in frequency of motor seizures were done with a Mann-Whitney U test. Between Jan 15, 2014, and Jan 15, 2015, 214 patients were enrolled; 162 (76%) patients who had at least 12 weeks of follow-up after the first dose of cannabidiol were included in the safety and tolerability analysis, and 137 (64%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. In the safety group, 33 (20%) patients had Dravet syndrome and 31 (19%) patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The remaining patients had intractable epilepsies of different causes and type. Adverse events were reported in 128 (79%) of the 162 patients within the safety group. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients were somnolence (n=41 [25%]), decreased appetite (n=31 [19%]), diarrhoea (n=31 [19%]), fatigue (n=21 [13%]), and convulsion (n=18 [11%]). Five (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Serious adverse events were reported in 48 (30%) patients, including one death-a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy regarded as unrelated to study drug. 20 (12%) patients had severe adverse events possibly related to cannabidiol use, the most common of which was status epilepticus (n=9 [6%]). The median monthly frequency of motor seizures was 30.0 (IQR 11.0-96.0) at baseline and 15.8 (5.6-57.6) over the 12 week treatment period. The median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 36.5% (IQR 0-64.7). Our findings suggest that cannabidiol might reduce seizure frequency and might have an adequate safety profile in children and young adults with highly treatment-resistant epilepsy. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to characterise the safety profile and true efficacy of this compound.

"	"A good knowledge of safety and age group-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in young pediatric patients is of great importance in clinical practice. This paper presents 6-month interim safety and PK from an ongoing 2-year open-label study (Study 303) of adjunctive rufinamide treatment in pediatric subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years with inadequately controlled epilepsies of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) spectrum. Subjects (N = 37) were randomized to either rufinamide or any other approved AED chosen by the investigator as adjunctive therapy to the subject's existing regimen of 1-3 AEDs. Interim safety results showed that treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the rufinamide (22 [88.0%]) and any-other-AED group (9 [81.8%]), with most events considered mild or moderate. A population PK analysis was conducted including plasma rufinamide concentrations from Study 303 and two other study populations of LGS subjects ≥ 4 years. The rufinamide PK profile was dose independent. The apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated from the PK model was 2.19 L/h; it was found to increase significantly as a function of body weight. Coadministration of valproic acid significantly decreased rufinamide CL/F. CL/F was not significantly affected by other concomitant AEDs, age, gender, race, hepatic function, or renal function. No adjustments to body weight-based rufinamide dosing in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years are necessary. Rufinamide was safe and well tolerated in these pediatric subjects. Results from the interim analysis demonstrate that rufinamide's safety and PK profile is comparable in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 and ≥ 4 years with LGS. Study 303 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01405053).

We conducted an open-label extension study following a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive rufinamide therapy in Japanese patients with LGS. Fifty-four patients participated in the extension study. Seizure frequency was evaluated until 52 weeks after the start of the extension study. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout both studies. Of the 54 patients, 41 (75.9%) completed the extension study. The median duration of exposure to rufinamide was 818.0 days in all 54 patients, and 38 patients (70.4%) received rufinamide for 2 years or more. The median percent change in the frequency of tonic-atonic seizures relative to the frequency at the start of the double-blind study was -39.3% (12 weeks), -40.6% (24 weeks), -46.8% (32 weeks), -47.6% (40 weeks), and -36.1% (52 weeks). Reduction of total seizure frequency was also maintained until 52 weeks. Frequent treatment-related AEs were somnolence (20.4%), decreased appetite (16.7%), transient seizure aggravation including status epilepticus (13.0%), vomiting (11.1%), and constipation (11.1%). Adverse events were mild or moderate, except for transient seizure aggravation in three patients. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of rufinamide were decreased appetite, drug eruption, and worsening of underlying autism. When clinically notable weight loss was defined as a decrease ≥ 7% relative to baseline, 22 patients (40.7%) experienced weight loss at least once during long-term observation, although weight loss was reported as an AE in only three patients. This study demonstrated a long-term benefit of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for Japanese patients with LGS. Exacerbation of seizures and decreased appetite/weight loss should be monitored carefully.

Eighteen (17.5%) subjects experienced adverse events including insomnia, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, gastric discomfort, diarrhea, mood and behavioral problems, high blood pressure, headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Out of these, 6 (5.9%) patients discontinued the therapy. No hepatic failure or agranulocytosis was observed. Fifty-nine (57.72%) patients achieved ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 30 (29.12%) patients achieved seizure freedom.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is characterized by interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) occurring during sleep. The aim of this study was to determine whether sleep influences not only the frequency of seizures and IEDs, but also the time-dependent evolution that may support the hypothesis of homeostatic influences on epileptic threshold. Video polysomnography data from our database were reviewed to identify adult LGS patients with at least seven hours of nocturnal recording. Thirteen patients were identified and a second polysomnography was available for nine. The number, duration and index of IEDs, relative to total sleep, sleep stages, and time during the night, were calculated. The majority of IEDs occurred during non-rapid eye movement sleep, mainly in stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. Adjusting for time spent in each sleep stage, we found 45 IEDs/hour in stage 1, 123/hour in stage 2, 106/hour in slow-wave sleep, and 26/hour in rapid eye movement sleep. The temporal distribution of IEDs showed a significant rise in the first three hours of sleep, followed by a progressive decrease at the end of the night (F=85.6; p<0.0001). Interictal epileptiform discharges occurrence in adult LGS is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement sleep with an evident effect of stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. The significant IED occurrence in the first part of the night and the subsequent decline suggests a link between epileptic threshold and homeostatic sleep mechanisms. The latter should be considered regarding choice of therapy.

"	"To analyze the factors involved in the prognosis of non-symptomatic epilepsy (idiopathic and cryptogenic) in relation to their age of onset, monitored at a regional section of Neuropediatry reference over a period of three years. Patients with diagnosis of non-symptomatic epilepsy supervised from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, collecting epidemiological, clinical, complementary examinations and developmental data. Of the 4595 children attended during the period, the diagnosis of epilepsy was established in 605 (13.17%): 156 (25.79%) idiopathic epilepsies and 172 (28.43%) cryptogenic epilepsies. 15.7% of cryptogenic epilepsies and 14.1% of idiopathic epilepsies are refractory to treatment. Some epileptic syndromes, such as reflex epilepsies, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, have higher rates of drug resistance. 84.62% of idiopathic epilepsies and 79.77% of cryptogenic epilepsies present no other associated neurological disorder. A useful classification would be etiological, with two groups: a large group with established etiology or very likely genetic syndromes and another with no established cause. The age of onset of epilepsy in each etiological group adds prognostic orientation. Prognosis of epilepsy is worsened by refractoriness and associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and are generally worse at an earlier onset and in certain etiologies.

"	"Management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in adulthood can be particularly challenging. Published reports describing the use of rufinamide specifically in adult patients with LGS are scarce. A post hoc subgroup analysis of data from a phase III trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of rufinamide in adults with LGS. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with LGS, aged 4 years and above. During an 84-day, double-blind treatment period, patients received either adjunctive rufinamide therapy or placebo. Efficacy and safety/tolerability were assessed in a post hoc subgroup analysis of adult patients (≥18 years). Efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency, 50% responder rate, and seizure freedom rate; each calculated for total seizures and drop attacks. Safety/tolerability assessments included the evaluation of adverse events (AEs). Thirty-one adults aged 18-37 years with LGS received treatment with either rufinamide (n = 21) or placebo (n = 10). Three patients in the rufinamide group did not complete the trial. The median change from baseline in seizure frequency was -31.5% for rufinamide versus +22.1% for placebo (P = 0.008) for all seizures and -54.9% versus +21.7% (P = 0.002) for drop attacks. Responder rates were 33.3% for rufinamide versus 0% for placebo (P = 0.066) for all seizures and 57.1% versus 10.0% (P = 0.020) for drop attacks. No patient achieved freedom from all seizures but two rufinamide-treated patients (9.5%) became free of drop attacks. Overall, 71.4% of patients treated with rufinamide and 60.0% of patients treated with placebo experienced AEs; most commonly, somnolence (33.3% vs. 20.0%) and vomiting (19.0% vs. 0%). Most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Rufinamide demonstrated favorable efficacy and was generally well tolerated when used as adjunctive treatment for adults with LGS. Eisai.

"	"Lacosamide is FDA-approved in patients 17 years or older with partial-onset epilepsy. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of lacosamide in children with refractory generalized epilepsy. We retrospectively reviewed records of 21 children with refractory generalized epilepsy treated with lacosamide in our institution from 2009-2013 divided into 2 subgroups- I, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, and II, other generalized epilepsies. Efficacy was defined as seizure freedom or ≥50% seizure reduction. Descriptive data analysis including seizure freedom was compared using c(2) analysis. There were eleven females and ten males with a mean age, of 11.9 years. Five patients became seizure free, nine had ≥50% seizure reduction, and seven had no response. Group I: seven had ≥50% improvement, one did not respond. Group II: five became seizure free, two had ≥50% improvement, five had no response. Lacosamide is effective and well tolerated in children with refractory generalized epilepsy particularly patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug used as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and provides seizure control especially in tonic and atonic seizures. Rufinamide is expected to be effective in intractable epilepsy when atonic and tonic seizures exist. However, rufinamide induced seizure aggravation has been reported in a few patients, which was not associated with a specific type of seizure. A 12-year-old boy with intractable epilepsy had tonic and atonic seizures despite treatment with valproic acid (3000mg/day), levetiracetam (3000mg/day) and clobazam (40mg/day). Rufinamide was administered as adjuvant therapy. After 2weeks on rufinamide, he experienced atonic seizure worsening, and the frequency of epileptic discharges increased. The deterioration in seizure frequency and epileptiform discharges resolved when rufinamide was discontinued. Rufinamide may aggravate atonic seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy.

26945476	"Abnormal cognitive network interactions in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A potential mechanism of epileptic encephalopathy
"	"In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), recurrent epileptic activity is thought to contribute to impaired cognition (epileptic encephalopathy). Using concurrent electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), we recently showed that epileptiform discharges in LGS recruit large-scale networks that normally support key cognitive processes. In LGS, given that epileptic activity engages cognitive networks, and cognition is pervasively impaired, we hypothesized that cognitive network interactions in LGS are persistently abnormal. We studied 15 LGS patients (mean age ± 1 standard deviation [SD] = 28.7 ± 10.6 years) and 17 healthy controls (mean age ± 1 SD = 27.6 ± 6.6 years) using task-free EEG-fMRI. Four networks of interest (default-mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and anterior salience) were defined using group-level independent components analysis (ICA). Functional connectivity within and between networks was determined for each subject, and then LGS network interactions were compared to network behavior in the control group. To test whether group differences were present in periods without scalp-detectable epileptiform discharges (i.e., persistent), we separately assessed discharge-affected and discharge-unaffected epochs in six patients with sufficient data for this analysis. In LGS, cognitive networks showed (1) reduced within-network integration, including weaker connectivity within the default-mode network, and (2) impaired between-network segregation, including stronger connectivity between the default-mode and dorsal attention networks. Abnormal interactions were present during fMRI periods with and without discharges, indicating that impaired network behavior may endure during periods without scalp-detectable epileptic activity. In LGS, cognitive network interactions are persistently abnormal. Given that cognition typically worsens with the onset of LGS, and may improve after seizure control, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the epileptic process in LGS may initiate and perhaps sustain abnormal network behavior. We propose that epileptic encephalopathy may be a consequence of persistently disrupted cognitive network interactions.

26950270	"Epileptic encephalopathy de novo GABRB mutations impair γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor function
"	"The Epi4K Consortium recently identified 4 de novo mutations in the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor β3 subunit gene GABRB3 and 1 in the β1 subunit gene GABRB1 in children with one of the epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and infantile spasms (IS). Because the etiology of EEs is often unknown, we determined the impact of GABRB mutations on GABAA receptor function and biogenesis. GABAA receptor α1 and γ2L subunits were coexpressed with wild-type and/or mutant β3 or β1 subunits in HEK 293T cells. Currents were measured using whole cell and single channel patch clamp techniques. Surface and total expression levels were measured using flow cytometry. Potential structural perturbations in mutant GABAA receptors were explored using structural modeling. LGS-associated GABRB3(D120N, E180G, Y302C) mutations located at β+ subunit interfaces reduced whole cell currents by decreasing single channel open probability without loss of surface receptors. In contrast, IS-associated GABRB3(N110D) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations at β- subunit interfaces produced minor changes in whole cell current peak amplitude but altered current deactivation by decreasing or increasing single channel burst duration, respectively. GABRB3(E180G) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations also produced spontaneous channel openings. All 5 de novo GABRB mutations impaired GABAA receptor function by rearranging conserved structural domains, supporting their role in EEs. The primary effect of LGS-associated mutations was reduced GABA-evoked peak current amplitudes, whereas the major impact of IS-associated mutations was on current kinetic properties. Despite lack of association with epilepsy syndromes, our results suggest GABRB1 as a candidate human epilepsy gene. Ann Neurol 2016;79:806-825.

"	"The variable presentation and progression of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults. To improve diagnosis, a retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who were diagnosed as adults and/or were followed for several years after diagnosis. We present 5 cases that illustrate changes in LGS features over time. Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed by age 8 with intractable seizures, developmental delay, and abnormal EEGs with 1.5-2 Hz SSW discharges. However, seizure type and frequency changed over time for both patients, and the incidence of SSW discharges decreased. Cases 3, 4, and 5 were diagnosed with LGS as adults based on current and past features and symptoms, including treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive and motor impairment, and abnormal EEG findings. While incomplete, their records indicate that an earlier LGS diagnosis may have been missed or lost to history. These cases demonstrate the need to thoroughly and continuously evaluate all aspects of a patient's encephalopathy, bearing in mind the potential for LGS features to change over time.

26979179	"Combined surgical intervention with vagus nerve stimulation following corpus callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types, including drop attacks (DAs). Palliative procedures such as corpus callosotomy (CC) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may be effective for adequate seizure control in LGS patients who are not candidates for resective surgery. We evaluated the efficacy of the combination of these two procedures for LGS-related seizures. Ten patients with LGS (age 3-30 years at VNS implantation) underwent CC and subsequent VNS. We evaluated surgical outcomes, particularly with respect to the efficacy of VNS on seizure reduction rates for different residual seizure types after CC. We compared clinical parameters, including sex, age, seizure duration, history, MRI findings, extent of CC, number of antiepileptic drugs, and neuropsychological states, between VNS responders and non-responders to predict satisfactory seizure outcomes with respect to residual seizures after CC. VNS was effective for residual seizures regardless of seizure type (except for DAs) after CC in patients with LGS. Six of ten (60%) patients had a satisfactory seizure outcome (≥50% seizure reduction) for all residual seizure types after VNS. Two of ten (20%) patients were seizure-free at 12 months post-VNS. Even those patients that were non-responders, with respect to all seizures including DAs, after prior CC showed favorable responses to subsequent VNS. Compared to VNS, excellent seizure outcomes for DAs were achieved after CC in seven of nine (77.8%) patients with DAs. Among the clinical parameters, only conversation ability before VNS was significantly different between responders and non-responders (p = 0.033). Combined VNS and prior CC produced satisfactory seizure outcomes in LGS patients with different seizure types, including DAs. Even non-responders to prior CC responded to subsequent VNS for residual seizures, except for DAs. There is a greater likelihood that these procedures may be more feasible in patients who possess conversation ability prior to VNS.

"	"Drop seizures are especially problematic in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) because of their potential for serious injury. In this post hoc analysis of phase 3 OV-1012 data, a medical review was conducted of seizure-related injuries based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms from all adverse event (AE) listings. Patients receiving clobazam experienced fewer seizure-related injuries than those receiving placebo (8.9% all clobazam dosages vs. 27.1% placebo, p ≤ 0.05). Significant differences in the rates of seizure-related injuries were observed for the medium- and high-dosage clobazam treatment groups (4.8% and 10.2%, respectively, p ≤ 0.05). A total of 50 of 53 AEs considered seizure-related were mild or moderate in intensity; 3 severe AEs occurred in the placebo group (fall, contusion, and jaw fracture). A single serious AE (jaw fracture, which required hospitalization and surgery) occurred in a placebo-treated patient. Most injuries resolved by the end of the study. This analysis indicates that the reduction in drop-seizure frequency achieved with clobazam provides a clinically meaningful benefit, a reduced likelihood of experiencing seizure-related injuries.

"	"Dynamin 1 is a large neuron-specific GTPase involved in the endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 1 (DNM1) underlie two epileptic encephalopathy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Mice homozygous for the Dnm1 ""fitful"" mutation, a non-synonymous coding variant in an alternatively spliced exon of Dnm1 (exon 10a; isoform designation: Dnm1a(Ftfl)) have an epileptic encephalopathy-like disorder including lethal early onset seizures, locomotor and neurosensory deficits. Although fitful heterozygotes have milder recurrent seizures later in life, suggesting an additive or semi-dominant mechanism, the molecular etiology must also consider the fact that Dnm1a(Ftfl) exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in vitro. Another complication is that the fitful mutation induces alterations in the relative abundance of Dnm1 splice variants; mutants have a downregulation of Dnm1a and an upregulation of Dnm1b, changes which may contribute to the epileptic pathology. To examine whether Dnm1a loss of function, Dnm1a(Ftfl) dominance or compensation by Dnm1b is the most critical for severe seizures, we studied alternate isoform-specific mutant mice. Mice lacking Dnm1 exon 10a or Dnm1 exon 10b have neither spontaneous seizures nor other overt abnormalities, suggesting that in normal conditions the major role of each isoform is redundant. However, in the presence of Dnm1a(Ftfl) only exon 10a deleted mice experience severe seizures. These results reveal functional differences between Dnm1a and Dnm1b isoforms in the presence of a challenge, i.e. toxic Dnm1(Ftfl), while reinforcing its effect explicitly in this model of severe pediatric epilepsy.

27379172	"Automatic Identification of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Secondary Generalized Epilepsy
"	"Ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) are characteristic signal patterns of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy, which assist with the diagnosis and characterization of various types of epilepsy. The EEG signal, however, is often recorded from patients with epilepsy for a long period of time, and thus detection and identification of EDs have been a burden on medical doctors. This paper proposes a new method for automatic identification of two types of EDs, repeated sharp-waves (sharps), and runs of sharp-and-slow-waves (SSWs), which helps to pinpoint epileptogenic foci in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). In the experiments with iEEG data acquired from a patient with LGS, our proposed method detected EDs with an accuracy of 93.76% and classified three different signal patterns with a mean classification accuracy of 87.69%, which was significantly higher than that of a conventional wavelet-based method. Our study shows that it is possible to successfully detect and discriminate sharps and SSWs from background EEG activity using our proposed method.

"	"Felbamate is a derivative of meprobamate used in second-line partial epilepsy and in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Felbamate is well absorbed and has linear kinetics: Cmax and AUC increasing linearly with dose. The metabolism takes place in the liver. Metabolites represent 40 to 60% of excretion and are eliminated via the urine. The half-life is between 15 and 23 hours. Clearance is dependent on renal function. There is a concentration - efficacy and concentration - toxicity relationship. These arguments are in favour of a TDM but the therapeutic range is not clearly established. Potentially fatal side effects can be caused by felbamate (aplastic anemia, acute liver failure), which limits its use because they are dose-independant.

"	"To investigate the clinical outcome of patients treated with chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian nucleus (CM) for refractory epilepsy and to determine the location of active contacts. The outcome of CM stimulation was evaluated as percent seizure reduction compared to the baseline 3 months. To establish the location of active contacts, 27 leads were studied in 14 patients with refractory epilepsy. An analysis was conducted to reveal whether any coordinates of the center of the active contacts predicted percent seizure reduction. With an average follow-up of 18.2 ± 5.6 months, the mean percent seizure reduction (n = 14) was 68 ± 22.4% (25-100%). Eleven of the 14 patients (78.6%) achieved >50% improvement in seizure frequency. Specifically, all 4 patients (100%) with generalized epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and 7 of 10 patients (70%) with multilobar epilepsy showed >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The mean coordinates of the center of the active contact were located in the superior part of the anterior ventrolateral CM. The calculated coordinates of laterality from midline (x), anterior-posterior (y) and height (z) from the posterior commissure did not correlate with seizure outcome measured by percent seizure reduction. However, the locations of active contacts used during chronic CM stimulation in multilobar epilepsy were identified more dorsal to those used in generalized epilepsy. Chronic CM stimulation is a safe and effective means in the treatment of refractory epilepsy.

We used the pathologic classification proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy and included clinical profile and seizure and neurodevelopmental outcomes in analyses. There were 11 cases of FCD type I, 34 of type IIa, 19 of type IIb, and 11 of type III. Fifty-one cases (68.0%) presented clinically as focal epilepsy (FE) and 24 (32.0%) as epileptic encephalopathy (EE), including 16 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 8 with West syndrome. We observed EE in 7 cases (63.6%) in FCD type I, 14 (41.2%) in type IIa, 2 (10.5%) in type IIb, and 1 (9.1%) in type III. We found the following more frequently in EE: seizure onset occurring at younger than 2 years (EE: 20 [83.3%], FE: 19 [37.3%]; p < 0.001), presence of intellectual disability before surgery (EE: 22 [91.7%], FE: 29 [56.9%]; p = 0.003), and multilobar resections (EE: 19 [79.2%], FE: 15 [29.4%]; p < 0.001). Forty-eight cases (64.0%) were seizure-free; 66.7% (34/51) in FE, 58.3% (14/24) in EE. Neurodevelopmental level showed more improvement (11/48 vs 0/27, p = 0.011) and less deterioration (2/48 vs 9/27, p = 0.001) in the seizure-free group compared to the non-seizure-free group. FCD can cause FE and EE in pediatric age, and resective surgery should be considered as a treatment option for both types of epilepsy.

"	"Previous studies using verapamil as an adjunct therapy to anti-seizure medications have used doses ranging from 120 to 240mg per day. However, despite showing promising results, there was an increased incidence of side effects. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of low dose verapamil (20mg p.o. tid) as adjunct therapy to patient's anti-seizure medications irrespective of the type or etiology of the epilepsy. In an open-label pilot study we enrolled 20 adult patients with history of epilepsy who continued to have a minimum of 2 seizures a month despite being on or having tried maximum tolerated doses of 3 or more standard antiepileptic drugs under the supervision of an epileptologist. 10 of the 19 patients (53%) who continued in the study had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. 2 of the patients (10%) had <50% seizure reduction. The remaining 7 patients (37%) had no reduction in their seizures. There was no discontinuation due to adverse events. P-Glycoprotein is a prototypical drug transporter that has been strongly implicated in drug resistance in epilepsy. Verapamil at a relatively low dose was well tolerated compared to previous studies which used up to 240mg per day and seems to have contributed to a statistically significant improvement in seizure control in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, especially in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A randomized double blind controlled study at this low dose with larger sample size may be more informative.

Quantitative analysis of the FDA and EMA databases for orphan drug designations according to STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Within the US Orphan Drug Act 40 designations were granted delivering nine approvals, i.e. clobazam, diazepam viscous solution for rectal administration, felbamate, fosphenytoin, lamotrigine, repository corticotropin, rufinamide, topiramate, and vigabatrin. Since 2000 the EMA granted six orphan drug designations whereof two compounds were approved, i.e. rufinamide and stiripentol. In the US, two orphan drug designations were withdrawn. Orphan drugs were approved for conditions including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, Dravet syndrome, and status epilepticus. Comparing time to approval for rufinamide, which was approved in the US and the EU to treat rare seizure conditions, the process seems faster in the EU (2.2 years) than in the US (4.3 years). Orphan drug development in the US and in the EU delivered only few molecular entities to treat rare seizure disorders.

This study enrolled 68 children with LGS and without focal lesion on brain MRI, of which 25 received medicine (medicine group) and 43 underwent surgery (surgery group), including 20 with exclusively resective surgery (exclusively resection subgroup) and 23 with resective surgery combined with CCT (combined CCT subgroup). All patients were followed for 3-5 years. Significant differences in seizure control were observed between the medicine group and the exclusively resection subgroup and combined CCT subgroup at the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year follow-ups. There was a trend that the children with resection combined with CCT had better seizure control than those with exclusively resection at the three follow-ups, but this could not be verified by the statistical method used. Furthermore, significant differences were not observed in seizure control between children with different MRI findings, age at surgery, or pathology in the surgery group. The percentage of long-term seizure-free did not remain as high as the percentage of early stage seizure-free at 1-year follow-up. However, the children with combined CCT surgery demonstrated more postoperative improvement than the children with resective surgery alone based on the mean QOL score (10.78 vs. 5.75, p = 0.0152) and full-scale IQ (7.91 vs. 4.55, p = 0.0446).

We also found that the absolute delta power in the resected area was higher than that in the remaining area. However, this trend was not statistically different in all patients. For relative band powers, we found decreased relative band power in the beta and gamma band ranges within the areas defined by the surgical margins. Delta, theta, and alpha relative band power differences between the resected and remaining areas were inconsistent between the subjects. Our results showed systematic relative beta and gamma band power variation in the resected areas of LGS patients.

We selected eight LGS patients who underwent resective surgery in the absence of definite neuroimaging findings. We calculated the absolute and relative band powers of continuous spike-free iEEG data and compared the characteristics of the resected and remaining regions. For absolute band powers, there was a trend for higher absolute gamma band power in the remaining brain section. We also found that the absolute delta power in the resected area was higher than that in the remaining area. However, this trend was not statistically different in all patients. For relative band powers, we found decreased relative band power in the beta and gamma band ranges within the areas defined by the surgical margins. Delta, theta, and alpha relative band power differences between the resected and remaining areas were inconsistent between the subjects. Our results showed systematic relative beta and gamma band power variation in the resected areas of LGS patients.

"	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) on the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and explore the relationships between EEG changes and clinical efficacy. We retrospectively studied 47 patients with LGS who accepted KD therapy between May 2011 and May 2015. Clinical efficacy and EEG features such as background activity, abnormal interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) and the discharge location were evaluated prior to and at 3 and 6 months after therapy. Responders were defined as ≥50% seizure reduction. At 3 months of treatment, 23 patients (48.9%) had ≥50% seizure reduction. Seven patients (14.9%) discontinued treatment between 3 and 6 months because of lack of efficacy or inability to adhere to the diet. At 6 months of treatment, 4 patients (10%) were seizure free, 5 (12.5%) had ≥90% seizure reduction, 12 (30%) had a reduction of 50-89%, and 19 (47.5%) had <50% reduction. Patients with improved EEG background and reduced IEDs had an improved seizure reduction rate compared with patients without change in EEG background or IEDs (p<0.01). The results show that the KD is effective in LGS. It can control seizures and improve EEG abnormalities. Early improvement in the EEG background and a reduction in IEDs may be predictors of a patient's response to diet.

"	"Drug-resistant epilepsy, not associated with acute brain complications or central nervous system leukaemic involvement, can develop in patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukaemia during childhood. It has been postulated that this rare complication may be due to CNS oncological treatment neurotoxicity, related to intrathecal drugs, such as methotrexate, and brain radiotherapy. We report four patients who developed drug-resistant epilepsy sometime after receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. All patients were female and received intrathecal methotrexate. One received additional intrathecal cytarabine, and two concomitant brain radiotherapy. Two developed Lennox-Gastaut type syndrome, one multifocal epilepsy, and one focal epilepsy related to a radiotherapy-induced cavernous angioma. The development of drug-resistant epilepsy after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia is a rare complication that may vary, from focal epilepsy to an epileptic encephalopathy. This may appear even years after the treatment has finished and is most likely associated with treatment-related neurotoxicity.

"	"There have been a few reports of patients who developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in the second decades of their life. The aim of this study was to investigate electroclinical presentation in patients with late-onset LGS. In addition, we evaluated structural abnormalities of the brain, which may give some clue about the common pathogenic pathway in LGS. We enrolled the patients with late-onset LGS. We collected electroclinical characteristics of the patients and evaluated structural abnormalities using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. The three subjects were diagnosed with late-onset LGS. The patients have no mental retardation and normal background activities on electroencephalography (EEG), and they had generalized paroxysmal fast activities on EEG, especially during sleep. The TBSS analysis revealed that fractional anisotropy values in the patients were significantly reduced in the white matter of brainstem compared with normal controls. However, VBM analysis did not show any significant difference between the patients and normal controls. Patients with late-onset LGS have different clinical and EEG characteristics from those with early-onset LGS. In addition, we demonstrated that brainstem dysfunction might contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset LGS.

28038390	"A two-year retrospective evaluation of perampanel in patients with highly drug-resistant epilepsy and cognitive impairment
"	"The objective of this work was to review systematically the efficacy and tolerability of perampanel (PER) in residential patients of an epilepsy center. We adopted an industry-independent noninterventional retrospective evaluation on the basis of the paper and electronic records complemented by personal information on the part of the treating neurologists. All patients (N=26, 15 females, mean age: 30, range 21-55years) started on PER from its introduction to the market in September 2012 until December 15th 2013 were included. Evaluation was carried out after 6, 12, and 24months of PER treatment. Changes in seizure frequency were calculated as the number of seizures during three months on PER compared to a three-month baseline period. The Clinical Global Impression Scale served as an instrument to record changes in seizure intensity beyond numerical values. Adverse effects were documented by means of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile. Most patients had structural or metabolic epilepsy, 2 patients suffered from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 2 from other symptomatic generalized epilepsy. All patients had grade III drug-resistant epilepsy. All patients had additional cognitive deficits of different degree. The retention rates were 61.5% after 6months, 46.2% after 12months, and 42.3% after 24months. The responder rates were 11.5% after 6months, 23.1% after 12months, and 7.7% after 24months. Partial responders (positive CGI and/or seizure reduction <50%) included, the respective values were 26.9%, 38.5%, and 23.1%. Only 1 patient was seizure free at 12months (but not at 24months). A loss of efficacy in the second year of treatment was suspected but the decrease of the responder rate could also be ascribed to a number of different circumstances. Adverse effects in the psychiatric field like irritability, aggression, increased sensitivity, and suicidal ideation/behavior occurred in 50% of the patients. They were the main reason to discontinue PER. After one year of treatment PER showed reasonable efficacy in a particularly difficult-to-treat population. Psychiatric adverse effects forced discontinuation in many cases.

"	"Two consanguineous families, one of Sudanese ethnicity presenting progressive neuromuscular disease, severe cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesion, anhydrosis, facial dysmorphism, and recurrent seizures and the other of Egyptian ethnicity presenting with neonatal hypotonia, bradycardia, and recurrent seizures, were evaluated for the causative gene mutation. Homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES) identified damaging homozygous variants in SCN10A, namely c.4514C>T; p.Thr1505Met in the first family and c.4735C>T; p.Arg1579\* in the second family. A third family, of Western European descent, included a child with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) who also had compound heterozygous missense mutations in SCN10A, namely, c.3482T>C; p.Met1161Thr and c.4709C>A; p.Thr1570Lys. A search for SCN10A variants in three consortia datasets (EuroEPINOMICS, Epi4K/EPGP, Autism/dbGaP) identified an additional five individuals with compound heterozygous variants. A Hispanic male with infantile spasms [c.2842G>C; p.Val948Leu and c.1453C>T; p.Arg485Cys], and a Caucasian female with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [c.1529C>T; p.Pro510Leu and c.4984G>A; p.Gly1662Ser] in the epilepsy databases and three in the autism databases with [c.4009T>A; p.Ser1337Thr and c.1141A>G; p.Ile381Val], [c.2972C>T; p.Pro991Leu and c.2470C>T; p.His824Tyr], and [c.4009T>A; p.Ser1337Thr and c.2052G>A; p.Met684Ile]. SCN10A is a member of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene family. Sodium channels are responsible for the instigation and proliferation of action potentials in central and peripheral nervous systems. Heterozygous mutations in VGSC genes cause a wide range of epileptic and peripheral nervous system disorders. This report presents autosomal recessive mutations in SCN10A that may be linked to epilepsy-related phenotypes, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

We have previously reported that patients with Dravet syndrome present a very peculiar motor phenotype. Here we sought to confirm that this association was not linked to the chronic use of antiepileptic drugs or the many lifetime seizures. To this aim, we studied 14 adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 14 adults with Dravet syndrome because both conditions share similar seizure severity. We found that antecollis and parkinsonian gait were significantly more common in the Dravet group, thus suggesting that these features are part of the Dravet syndrome adult phenotype.

"	"We previously observed that adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) show abnormal functional connectivity among cognitive networks, suggesting that this may contribute to impaired cognition. Herein we report network reorganization following seizure remission in a child with LGS who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after resection of a cortical dysplasia. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired during presurgical fMRI. Presurgical and postsurgical functional connectivity were compared using (1) graph theoretical analyses of small-world network organization and node-wise strength; and (2) seed-based analyses of connectivity within and between five functional networks. To explore the specificity of these postsurgical network changes, connectivity was further compared to nine children with LGS who did not undergo surgery. The presurgical EEG-fMRI revealed diffuse activation of association cortex during interictal discharges. Following surgery and seizure control, functional connectivity showed increased small-world organization, stronger connectivity in subcortical structures, and greater within-network integration/between-network segregation. These changes suggest network improvement, and diverged sharply from the comparison group of nonoperated children. Following surgery, this child with LGS achieved seizure control and showed extensive reorganization of networks that underpin cognition. This case illustrates that the epileptic process of LGS can directly contribute to abnormal network organization, and that this network disruption may be reversible.

The surveys, which were completed in full, were reviewed, and 53 cases of children aged between 9 months and 18 years were identified. Of these, 43 cases (82%) were from Mexico and 10 (18%) were from Latin American countries. Of the 43 Mexican cases, the diagnoses were as follows: 20 cases (47%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS); 13 cases (30%) had unspecified refractory epilepsy (URE); 8 cases (19%) had West syndrome (WS); 1 case (2%) had Doose syndrome (DS); and 1 case (2%) had Ohtahara syndrome (OS). In total, 47.1% of cases had previously been treated with 9 or more anticonvulsant therapies. The parents reported a decrease in convulsions when cannabidiol was used in 81.3% of the cases; a moderate to significant decrease occurred in 51% of cases, and 16% of cases were free from seizure. The number of antiepileptic drugs being used was reduced in 9/43 (20.9%) cases. No serious adverse effects were reported, with only some mild adverse effects, such as increased appetite or changes in sleep patterns, reported in 42% of cases.

"	"Low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) is a newly developed dietary therapeutic option for epilepsy that is less restrictive than the ketogenic diet (KD). Our objective was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of LGIT. From March 2014 to February 2015, 36 patients received LGIT at Severance Children's Hospital. One-year seizure outcomes and side effects were evaluated. A total of 36 patients were assessed. Fourteen were female. Common diagnoses were Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (33%, 12/36) and Dravet syndrome (14%, 5/36). The median age at the initiation of the LGIT was 12.6years (min.=1.5, max.=28, interquartile range (IQR) 8-17). After 3months of therapy, 20 (56%) patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, which was maintained in 19 (53%) patients for 1year. Two (6%) patients became seizure-free after 3months of LGIT; they remained seizure-free for 1year. These two had Dravet syndrome and generalized epilepsy. Only three (8%) patients discontinued treatment within 1year. Adverse events were rare, and two patients (6%) reported transient diarrhea. LGIT effectively reduced seizure frequency in the present study, although seizure freedom was infrequently achieved. LGIT may be considered as a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, particularly those who find KD effective but intolerable.

"	"The classic epileptic encephalopathies, including infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), are severe seizure disorders that usually arise sporadically. De novo variants in genes mainly encoding ion channel and synaptic proteins have been found to account for over 15% of patients with IS or LGS. The contribution of autosomal recessive genetic variation, however, is less well understood. We implemented a rare variant transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) to search for autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy genes in a cohort of 320 outbred patient-parent trios that were generally prescreened for rare metabolic disorders. In the current sample, our rare variant transmission disequilibrium test did not identify individual genes with significantly distorted transmission over expectation after correcting for the multiple tests. While the rare variant transmission disequilibrium test did not find evidence of a role for individual autosomal recessive genes, our current sample is insufficiently powered to assess the overall role of autosomal recessive genotypes in an outbred epileptic encephalopathy population.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is commonly characterized by a triad of features including multiple seizure types, intellectual disability or regression. LGS type of seizures is epilepsy which is due to abnormal vibrations occurring in seizures. During the time of such abnormal vibrations, both the seizures and the lungs suffer a lack in oxygen content to a considerable extent. This results in prolonged vibrations and loses of nervous control. As a neuro-lung protective strategy, a novel attempt has been made to enrich both seizures and lungs with oxygen content through the support of Perfluorodecalin (an excellent oxygen carrier) C10F18(PFD) and Perfluorohexane C6F14(PFH) along with an enhancement in the antiepileptic activity by the two chosen antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Benzodiazepine (BDZ). Perfluorodecalin C10F18(PFD) and Perfluorohexane C6F14(PFH) emulsions were prepared by sonication process with combination of nonionic emulsifier, Lecithin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine) as a surfactant in Aqueous phase medium. These emulsions were mixed with Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Benzodiazepine (BDZ) drugs maintained at a temperature of about -20°C to 20°C and were set to slow evaporation process. The products are subjected to Optical microscope, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) - Energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS).

"	"To delineate the clinical and EEG features of adults with focal epilepsy associated with a generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) pattern on EEG who developed refractory seizures, notably drop attacks, but do not fulfill the classical triad for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and provide further insight into LGS mechanisms. Among 957 patients admitted to video-EEG monitoring between 2002 and 2015, we retrospectively research adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy, drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. We collected demographic, anamnestic, and clinical data from medical records. We reviewed for all patients the interictal and ictal video-EEG recordings. We identified ten patients with focal epilepsy and electro-clinical features of LGS. As compared to classical LGS patients, our patients: (1) began epilepsy later (15.4 ± 8 years); (2) exhibited exclusively focal onset seizures, including drop attacks seizures linked to focal asymmetrical tonic posturing seizures; (3) had a stable cognition over time and (4) evolved favourably with a good secondary response to treatments in 80% of cases. Interestingly, all patients exhibited apparent diffuse interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities but a detailed analysis revealed that 50% had asymmetrical GPFA and 70% secondary bilateral synchrony processes. We may hypothesize here that a process of ""secondary LGS"" occurred which produced a worsening of seizures with the apparition of drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. This study brings arguments to consider that some cases of LGS could be linked to the development of a ""secondary epileptic network"" driven by a primary focal epileptic zone.

"	"Epileptic encephalopathies (EE) is a term coined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) to refer to a group of epilepsies in which the ictal and interictal abnormalities may contribute to progressive cerebral dysfunction. Among them, two affect mainly children and are very difficult to deal with, Doose and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, (DS and LGS, respectively). So far (Zavala-Yoe et al., J Integr Neurosci 15(2):205-223, 2015a and works of ours there), quantitative analysis of single case studies of EE have been performed. All of them are manifestations of drug resistant epileptic encephalopathies (DREES) and as known, such disorders require a lot of EEG studies through all patient's life. As a consequence, dozens of EEG records are stored by parents and neurologists as time goes by. However, taking into account all this massive information, our research questions (keeping colloquial wording by parents) arise: a) Which zone of the brain has been the most affected so far? b) On which year was the child better? c) How bad is our child with respect to others? We must reflect that despite clinical assessment of the EEG has undergone standardization by establishment of guidelines such as the recently published guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (Tsuchida et al., J Clin Neurophysiol 4(33):301-302, 2016), qualitative EEG will never be as objective as quantitative EEG, since it depends largely on the education and experience of the conducting neurophysiologist (Grant et al., Epilepsy Behav 2014(32):102-107, 2014, Rating, Z Epileptologie, Springer Med 27(2):139-142, 2014). We already answered quantitatively the above mentioned questions in the references of ours given above where we provided entropy curves and an entropy index which encompasses the complexity of bunches of EEG making possible to deal with massive data and to make objective comparisons among some patients simultaneously. However, we have refined that index here and we also offer another two measures which are spatial and dynamic. Moreover, from those indices we also provide what we call a temporal dynamic complexity path which shows in a standard 10-20 system head diagram the evolution of the lowest complexity per brain zone with respect to the EEG period. These results make it possible to compare quantitatively/graphically the progress of several patients at the same time, answering the questions posed above. The results obtained showed that we can associate low spatio-temporal entropy indices to multiple seizures events in several patients at the same time as well as tracking seizure progress in space and time with our entropy path, coinciding with neurophysiologists observations.

Six (23%) had apparently primary generalized epilepsy (0/6 drug resistant), two (8%) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and one (4%) West syndrome (all three were drug-resistant). As compared to the patients with no epilepsy, those with epilepsy were more likely to have MRI findings of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (23% vs. 5%, p=0.0064), and cerebral hemisphere tumors (31% vs. 10%, p=0.0079), but not of the other MRI findings including neurofibromatosis bright objects, or optic gliomas.

We also have observed three additional patients outside the above study with the association of NF1, MTS, and intractable epilepsy. Epilepsy is relatively common in NF1, often occurs in patients with brain tumors or with MTS which can coexist with FCD, can be associated with multiple types of epilepsy syndromes, and when localization-related is often drug-resistant. Patients with NF1 and MTS can respond to medial temporal lobectomy and may have coexisting medial temporal lobe cortical dysplasia.

"	"Background: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with serious injuries due to frequent and severe seizures. Of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) approved for LGS, clobazam is a more recent market entrant, having been approved in October 2011. Recent AED budget impact and cost-effectiveness analyses for LGS suggest that adding clobazam to a health plan formulary may result in decreased medical costs; however, research on clinical and economic outcomes and treatment patterns with these AED treatments in LGS is limited. Objectives: To compare the baseline characteristics and treatment patterns of new initiators of clobazam and other AEDs among LGS patients and compare healthcare utilization and costs before and after clobazam initiation among LGS patients. Methods: A retrospective study of probable LGS patients was conducted using the MarketScan® Commercial, Medicare Supplemental, and Medicaid databases (10/1/2010-3/31/2014). Results: In the Commercial/Medicare Supplemental population, clobazam users were younger, had fewer comorbidities, and more prior AED use than non-clobazam users. In the 12 months pre-treatment initiation, clobazam users had significantly more seizure-related inpatient stays and outpatient visits and higher total seizure-related (P < 0.001) and all-cause (P < 0.001) costs than non-clobazam users. Among clobazam users, when compared to the 12 months pre-clobazam initiation, seizure-related medical utilization and costs were lower in the 12 months post-clobazam initiation (P = 0.004). Total all-cause (P < 0.001) and seizure-related (P = 0.029) costs increased post-clobazam initiation mainly due to the increase in outpatient pharmacy costs. Similar results were observed in the Medicaid population. Conclusions: Baseline results suggest a prescribing preference for clobazam in severe LGS patients. Clobazam users had a reduction in seizure-related medical utilization and costs after clobazam initiation. The improvement in medical costs mostly offset the higher prescription costs following clobazam initiation.

"	"Rufinamide, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker, is widely used for the clinical treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that VGSC blockers have neuroprotective properties against ischemic damage following experimental cerebral ischemia. However, protective effects of rufinamide against cerebral ischemic insults have not been addressed. Therefore, in the present study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of rufinamide using a gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia. Gerbils were established by the occlusion of common carotid arteries for 5 min. The gerbils were divided into vehicle-treated sham-operated group, vehicle-treated ischemia-operated group, 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated sham-operated groups, and 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated ischemia-operated groups. Rufinamide was administrated intraperitoneally once daily for 3 days before ischemic surgery. To examine neuroprotective effects of rufinamide, we carried out cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence staining. In addition, we examined gliosis using immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (a marker for microglia). We found that pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide effectively protected pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) area after transient global cerebral ischemia. In addition, pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide significantly attenuated activations of astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 area. These findings suggest that rufinamide can display neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic insults and that its neuroprotective effect may involve the attenuation of ischemia-induced glial activation.

28846756	"Prevalence of Pathogenic Copy Number Variation in Adults With Pediatric-Onset Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability
"	"Copy number variation (CNV) is an important cause of neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about the role of CNV in adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability. To evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs and identify possible candidate CNVs and genes in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In this cross-sectional study, genome-wide microarray was used to evaluate a cohort of 143 adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability who were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital epilepsy outpatient clinic from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. The inclusion criteria were (1) pediatric seizure onset with ongoing seizure activity in adulthood, (2) intellectual disability of any degree, and (3) no structural brain abnormalities or metabolic conditions that could explain the seizures. DNA screening was performed using genome-wide microarray platforms. Pathogenicity of CNVs was assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score was used to evaluate genes within the identified CNVs that could play a role in each patient's phenotype. Of the 2335 patients, 143 probands were investigated (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [10.8] years; 69 male and 74 female). Twenty-three probands (16.1%) and 4 affected relatives (2.8%) (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [6.1] years; 11 male and 16 female) presented with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs (0.08-18.9 Mb). Five of the 23 probands with positive results (21.7%) had more than 1 CNV reported. Parental testing revealed de novo CNVs in 11 (47.8%), with CNVs inherited from a parent in 4 probands (17.4%). Sixteen of 23 probands (69.6%) presented with previously cataloged human genetic disorders and/or defined CNV hot spots in epilepsy. Eight nonrecurrent rare CNVs that overlapped 1 or more genes associated with intellectual disability, autism, and/or epilepsy were identified: 2p16.1-p15 duplication, 6p25.3-p25.1 duplication, 8p23.3p23.1 deletion, 9p24.3-p23 deletion, 10q11.22-q11.23 duplication, 12p13.33-13.2 duplication, 13q34 deletion, and 16p13.2 duplication. Five genes are of particular interest given their potential pathogenicity in the corresponding phenotypes and least tolerability to variation: ABAT, KIAA2022, COL4A1, CACNA1C, and SMARCA2. ABAT duplication was associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and KIAA2022 deletion with Jeavons syndrome. The high prevalence of pathogenic CNVs in this study highlights the importance of microarray analysis in adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability. Additional studies and comparison with similar cases are required to evaluate the effects of deletions and duplications that overlap specific genes.

28874317	"Generalized paroxysmal fast activity in EEG: An unrecognized finding in genetic generalized epilepsy
"	"To study generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). GPFA is an electroencephalographic (EEG) finding in patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy consisting of 15-25Hz bifrontally predominant generalized fast activity seen predominantly in sleep. Historically GPFA is linked to epileptic encephalopathy with drug resistant epilepsy and intellectual disability. However, GPFA has been rarely described as an atypical finding in patients with GGE without negative prognostic implication. We report cognitive profile and seizure characteristics in seven patients with GGE and GPFA. The Vanderbilt EMU and EEG reports were searched for the keywords ""idiopathic generalized epilepsy"", ""GPFA""and ""generalized spike and wave discharges (GSWD)"". We reviewed the EEG tracings and the electronic medical records of patients thus identified. The seizure type, frequency, neurological work-up, clinical profile and imaging data were recorded. Awake and sleep states were captured on EEGs of all patients. On EEG tracing review six patients were confirmed to have GSWD and GPFA; one patient had GPFA but no GSWD. All patients had normal cognitive function. Four had a normal brain MRI and one a normal head CT (two were never imaged). None of the patients had tonic seizures. The main seizure type was generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in five patients, absence in two. Age at onset of epilepsy ranged from 4 to 24years. The mean GTC seizure frequency at the time of EEG was 3; two patients were seizure free on two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). GPFA can be an unrecognized electrographic finding in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy. While GPFA remains an important diagnostic EEG feature for epileptic encephalopathy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) it is not specific for this diagnosis. Thus, GPFA may have a spectrum of variable phenotypic expression. The finding of GPFA is not necessarily indicative of unfavorable outcome.

"	"Rufinamide is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged ≥4years. The objective of this study was to provide real-world, long-term data on patients with LGS initiating rufinamide as add-on therapy and patients with LGS receiving other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A Phase IV, noninterventional, multicenter registry study was conducted in patients with LGS aged ≥4years requiring modification to any AED treatment, including initiation of add-on rufinamide therapy. Safety/tolerability was assessed by evaluating treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and efficacy was assessed using a generic seizure frequency scale. A total of 111 patients from 64 sites in 8 European countries were included, of whom 64 initiated rufinamide (""rufinamide"" group) and 21 did not receive rufinamide at any time during the study (""no-rufinamide"" group). Mean ages were 16.1years (rufinamide) and 15.0years (no rufinamide). The median duration of follow-up was >2years (range: 1.3-46.4months). Antiepileptic drug-related TEAEs were reported for 40.6% (rufinamide) and 33.3% (no rufinamide) of patients and led to discontinuation of 7.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The most frequently reported rufinamide-related TEAEs (≥5% patients) were somnolence (7.8%) and decreased appetite (6.3%). There were no unexpected safety/tolerability findings. At month 12, the proportion of patients with improvement in all seizures (""much improved"" or ""very much improved"") was 28.6% (12/42) for the rufinamide group and 14.3% (2/14) for the no-rufinamide group. The study provided valuable information on LGS and its management, and evidence that rufinamide has a consistent and generally favorable safety/tolerability profile when used in routine clinical practice.

"	"Rufinamide (R) is a triazole derivative approved for the management of partial seizures and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, in November 2007. Crystal structure, solid state characterization, drug-excipient compatibility and solubility play a pivotal role in formulation development. This work deals with the crystal structure elucidation of R by single crystal X-ray diffraction and solid state characterization by thermal, spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. Drug- excipient compatibility was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). New RP-HPLC method for quantification of R was developed with improved retention time. Solubility and dissolution of drug in different media was determined. Additionally, the flow behavior of the drug was evaluated by measuring Carr's index and Hausner's ratio, while the compressibility behavior was studied using Well's protocol. R crystallized from dimethylformamide (R-DMF) was utilized for single crystal analysis. The drug crystallized in triclinic crystal system with P-1 space group. Asymmetric unit cell consists of two molecules of R held by intermolecular hydrogen bond (connected by NH⋯O, which forms the catemeric chain). Analytical outcomes from DSC, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed that the drug was present in pure crystalline form and was devoid of any polymorphic or pseudopolymorphic impurities. Influence of pH on the solubility and dissolution of R-DMF was found to be insignificant. The drug exhibited poor aqueous solubility, which was improved nearly 4.6 fold with the addition of 2% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). The drug exhibits poor flow and elastic compression nature. Excipients such as poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, SLS, lactose monohydrate, starch and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E15 were incompatible with R-DMF as identified by thermal analysis. It is envisaged that these information regarding solid state properties of R-DMF would aid in identifying a logical path for formulation development.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with childhood onset that usually continues through adolescence and into adulthood. In the long term, patients with this condition still have intractable seizures, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical comorbidities. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and EEG characteristics of a group of adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with LGS older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years. Median follow-up was 14.4years (range: 2-40). All of our patients had 3 or more seizure types during their clinical history. The most prevalent seizure types at follow-up were atypical absences (28/38), tonic (28/38), generalized tonic-clonic (17/38), focal (11/38), and myoclonic seizures (9/38). All patients had drug-resistant seizures. Besides epilepsy, intellectual disability and behavioral problems were prominent features. Surprisingly, paroxysmal nonepileptic seizures were reported in 3 patients. Our observations confirm the poor outcome of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous West syndrome.

"	"Given the complexities managing Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)-comorbid conditions, multiple associated seizure types that tend to be refractory to treatment-dosage optimization of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is a challenge. In the absence of clinical trial data on optimization of AED dosage in patients with LGS, dose titration is guided by personal experience, anecdotal evidence, and specific patient factors (age, comorbid conditions and medications, seizure types, etc.). The goal of this study was to determine whether a 20% increase in adjunctive clobazam was a reasonable benchmark for improved seizure response in patients with LGS who had responded to adjunctive clobazam treatment during a 12-week lead-in trial. This was a post hoc analysis of data from a long-term, open-label extension (OLE) study, which comprised patients who completed 1 of 2 pivotal clobazam lead-in studies. During the lead-in studies, patients received either placebo or clobazam (0.25, 0.50, or 1.0mg/kg/d) (maximum 40mg/d); during OLE, patients received clobazam up to 2.0mg/kg/d (maximum 80mg/d). The post hoc analysis population comprised patients who had ≥25%, ≥50%, or ≥75% seizure reduction from baseline during lead-in clobazam treatment and ≥12months of follow-up data during OLE. Successful dosage increase (i.e., dosage optimization) was defined as ≥20% clobazam dosage increase from OLE baseline, and improved seizure control from OLE baseline (improvement in seizure responder status, or >50% reduction in total seizure frequency). Patients were stratified by responder status after lead-in treatment (OLE baseline) and by lead-in clobazam dosage received. The findings of the analysis indicated that clobazam dosage increases of ≥20% during long-term treatment improved seizure control >80% of patients with LGS who responded to clobazam during lead-in treatment. Rates of successful dosage increase during OLE were high regardless of lead-in dosage received, with the highest rate of successful dosage increase among patients who received low-dosage clobazam during lead-in. Similarly, rates of successful dose increase were high regardless of lead-in seizure responder category, with the highest rates occurring in patients with the highest (≥75%) lead-in response.

"	"To describe electroclinical features and outcome of 6 patients harboring KCNB1 mutations. Clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, and brain MRI data analysis. Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 95 epilepsy gene panel. The mean age at seizure onset was 11 months. The mean follow-up of 11.3 years documented that 4 patients following an infantile phase of frequent seizures became seizure free; the mean age at seizure offset was 4.25 years. Epilepsy phenotypes comprised West syndrome in 2 patients, infantile-onset unspecified generalized epilepsy, myoclonic and photosensitive eyelid myoclonia epilepsy resembling Jeavons syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and focal epilepsy with prolonged occipital or clonic seizures in each and every one. Five patients had developmental delay prior to seizure onset evolving into severe intellectual disability with absent speech and autistic traits in one and stereotypic hand movements with impulse control disorder in another. The patient with Jeavons syndrome evolved into moderate intellectual disability. Mutations were de novo, 4 missense and 2 nonsense, 5 were novel, and 1 resulted from somatic mosaicism. KCNB1-related manifestations include a spectrum of infantile-onset generalized or focal seizures whose combination leads to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy including West, Lennox-Gastaut, and Jeavons syndromes. Long-term follow-up highlights that following a stormy phase, seizures subside or cease and treatment may be eased or withdrawn. Cognitive and motor functions are almost always delayed prior to seizure onset and evolve into severe, persistent impairment. Thus, KCNB1 mutations are associated with diffuse brain dysfunction combining seizures, motor, and cognitive impairment.

"	"Epileptic encephalopathies are severe epilepsy disorders with strong genetic bases. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 70 patients with epileptic encephalopathies. The likely pathogenicity of variants in candidate genes was evaluated by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) scoring taken together with the accepted clinical presentation. Thirty-three candidate variants were detected after population filtration and computational prediction. According to ACMG, 21 candidate variants, including 18 de novo variants, were assessed to be pathogenic/likely pathogenic with clinical concordance. Twelve variants were initially assessed as uncertain significance by ACMG, among which 3 were considered causative and 3 others were considered possibly causative after analysis of clinical concordance. In total, 24 variants were identified as putatively causative, among which 19 were novel findings. SCN1A mutations were identified in 50% of patients with Dravet syndrome. TSC1/TSC2 mutations were detected in 66.7% of patients with tuberous sclerosis. STXBP1 mutations were the main findings in patients with West syndrome. Mutations in SCN2A, KCNT1, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were identified in patients with epileptic infantile with migrating focal seizures; among them, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were first identified as potential causative genes. Only one CHD2 mutation was detected in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study highlighted the utility of targeted NGS in genetic diagnoses of epileptic encephalopathies and a comprehensive evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants based on ACMG scoring and assessment of clinical concordance. Epileptic encephalopathies differ in genetic causes, and the genotype-phenotype correlations would provide insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

"	"Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a rare, severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, are frequently treatment resistant to available medications. No controlled studies have investigated the use of cannabidiol for patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol as an add-on anticonvulsant therapy in this population of patients. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43·9% (IQR -69·6 to -1·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21·8% (IQR -45·7 to 1·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17·21 (95% CI -30·32 to -4·09; p=0·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment. Add-on cannabidiol is efficacious for the treatment of patients with drop seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is generally well tolerated. The long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol is currently being assessed in the open-label extension of this trial. GW Pharmaceuticals.

"	"Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an effective palliative surgical treatment for patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). However, research on the long-term functional effects of CC is sparse. We aimed to investigate these effects and their associated clinical conditions over the two years after CC. Long-term clinical EEG recordings of 30 patients with LGS who had good and bad seizure outcome after CC were collected and retrospectively studied. It was found that CC caused brain network 'hubs' to shift from paramedian to lateral regions in the good-recovery group, which reorganized the brain network into a more homogeneous state. We also found increased local clustering coefficients in patients with bad outcomes and decreases, implying enhanced network integration, in patients with good outcomes. The small worldness of brain networks in patients with good outcomes increased in the two years after CC, whereas it decreased in patients with bad outcomes. The covariation of small-worldness with the rate of reduction in seizure frequency suggests that this can be used as an indicator of CC outcome. Local and global network changes during the long-term state might be associated with the postoperative recovery process and could serve as indicators for CC outcome and long-term LGS recovery.

29558884	"Few individuals with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have autism spectrum disorder: a comparison with Dravet syndrome
"	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in epilepsy has been a topic of increasing interest, which in general occurs in 15-35% of the patients with epilepsy, more frequently in those with intellectual disability (ID). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are two typical forms of intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with ID. We previously reported that ASD was diagnosed in 24.3% of patients with DS, higher in those with profound ID. Given the severe epilepsy and high frequency of ID in LGS, it is necessary to know whether ASD is a common psychomotor co-morbidity of LGS. This study evaluated the autistic behaviors and intelligence in patients with LGS and further compared that between LGS and DS, aiming to understand the complex pathogenesis of epilepsy-ASD-ID triad. A total of 50 patients with LGS and 45 patients with DS were enrolled and followed up for at least 3 years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and evaluations of ASD and ID were performed. No patients with LGS fully met the diagnostic criteria for ASD, but three of them exhibited more or less autistic behaviors. Majority (86%) of LGS patients presented ID, among which moderate to severe ID was the most common. Early onset age and symptomatic etiology were risk predictors for ID. The prevalence of ASD in LGS was significantly lower than that in DS (0/50 vs. 10/45, p < 0.001), while the prevalence and severity of ID showed no significant difference between the two forms of epileptic encephalopathy. This study demonstrated a significant difference in the co-morbidity of ASD between LGS and DS, although they had a similar prevalence and severity of ID, refuting the proposal that the prevalence of ASD in epilepsy is accounted for by ID. These findings suggest that the co-morbidity of ASD, ID, and epilepsy may result from multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms.

The de novo p.Glu590Lys variant was identified by whole-exome sequencing (n = 5) or targeted gene panel (n = 4). We performed electroclinical and imaging phenotyping on all patients. The cohort comprised 7 males and 2 females. Mean age at study was 13 years (0.5-21.0). Median age at seizure onset was 6 months (2 months to 9 years). Seizure types at onset were myoclonic, atypical absence with myoclonic components, and focal seizures. Epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram was seen in 8 cases: generalized polyspike-wave (6) or multifocal discharges (2). Seizures were drug resistant in 7 or controlled with valproate (2). Six patients had a DEE: myoclonic DEE (3), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (2), and West syndrome (1). Two had a static encephalopathy and genetic generalized epilepsy, including absence epilepsy in 1. One infant had multifocal epilepsy. Eight had severe cognitive impairment, with autistic features in 6. The p.Glu590Lys variant affects a highly conserved glutamine residue in the CUT domain predicted to interfere with CUX2 binding to DNA targets during neuronal development. Patients with CUX2 p.Glu590Lys display a distinctive phenotypic spectrum, which is predominantly generalized epilepsy, with infantile-onset myoclonic DEE at the severe end and generalized epilepsy with severe static developmental encephalopathy at the milder end of the spectrum.

"	"Clobazam (CLB) is approved as adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 2 years and older. It is converted to an active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB) by CYP3A4, which is then broken down to an inactive metabolite by CYP2C19. This study characterizes the impact of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 drug interactions on CLB and NCLB serum concentrations (Cp) and concentration/dose (Cp/D) ratios in pediatric patients with epilepsy. This was a retrospective chart review including patients older than 1 month, who received CLB between April 2012 and March 2017. Extracted data included patient demographics, CLB daily dose, CLB and NCLB Cp, calculated CLB and NCLB Cp/Cp and Cp/D ratios, and all concomitant drugs. The study included 995 CLB concentration sets from 302 patients (median age 7.6 years and range 0.2-40.1 years). Pharmacokinetic variability was extensive, as seen by widespread ranges of CLB and NCLB Cp, NCLB/CLB Cp ratio, and 3 Cp/D ratios (CLB, NCLB, and CLB + NCLB). Comedications, described as CYP3A4 inducers and/or CYP2C19 inhibitors (carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, felbamate, (fos)phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, rufinamide, and topiramate), generally increased NCLB/CLB Cp ratio (267%-400%), NCLB Cp/D ratio (167%-202%), and CLB + NCLB Cp/D ratio (142%-185%) and decreased CLB Cp/D ratio (47%-76%) compared with a group of concentration sets in patients receiving only neutral comedications (P < 0.025 for all comparisons). Older age was associated with higher Cp/D ratios (mg/kg), indicative of decreased clearance. Pharmacokinetic variability of CLB in pediatric patients is extensive, and it is influenced by drug-drug interactions and age. Therapeutic drug monitoring of CLB and active metabolite NCLB with calculation of various Cp/Cp and Cp/D ratios can provide useful insight into CLB pharmacokinetics and help differentiate between causes of variability.

KD has certain effect on children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, and it can reduce interictal epileptic discharge frequency, and improve the background rhythm of EEG. The reduction of epileptiform discharges in awake state is in favor of the reduction of seizures frequency, thus increasing the efficacy, and improve the cognitive function, language, and motor function to varying degrees, combined with less adverse reaction, which is worthy of clinical application.

29768152	"Effect of Cannabidiol on Drop Seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
"	"Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560 .).

"	"Epilepsy is the most common neurological symptom in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), occurring in 72-85% of affected individuals. Despite the large number of patients reported, their electroclinical phenotype has been rarely described. We analyzed seizure semiology through ictal video-electroencephalography (V-EEG) recordings in a large series of patients. In this multicenter study, we reviewed V-EEGs of 51 patients: ictal recordings were analyzed in correlation with their clinical variables. The median age of epilepsy onset was six months (one day-16 years), with onset in the first year of life in 71% patients (36/51), in 10 of them during the neonatal period. Sixty-five percent of patients (33/51) experienced epileptic spasms in their life, with late-onset (>two years) in five; 42% of the epileptic spasms persisted after age two years, despite the onset in the first year of life. We identified four different electroclinical subsets: focal epilepsy (35%, 18/51), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome evolution (27%, 14/51), focal seizures with persisting spasms (33%, 17/51), and spasms only (4%, 2/51). We reviewed 45 focal seizures, 13 clusters of epileptic spasms, and seven generalized seizures. In 12 patients, we recorded different seizure types. In 71% of the focal seizures (32/45), the ictal pattern was focal without diffusion. In 38% of the patients (5/13) epileptic spasms were related to typical diffuse slow wave pattern associated with superimposed fast activity, with focal predominance. Focal seizures and focal spasms resulted as the most frequent seizure types in TSC. Seizure onset was variable but showing a predominant involvement of the frontocentral regions (40%). Discrete clinical signs characterized the seizures, and behavioral arrest was the predominant first clinical objective sign. Epileptic spasms were a typical presentation at all ages, frequently asymmetrical and associated with lateralizing features, especially in older patients.

"	"Fenfluramine is being developed as a low-dose adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome and other epileptic encephalopathies, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Most patients with Dravet syndrome receive multiple antiepileptic drugs, making it challenging for caregivers to track correct administration times. The present Phase I study was conducted to determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic properties of fenfluramine. Healthy nonsmoking subjects aged 18 to 50 years were enrolled in an open-label, crossover, Phase I pharmacokinetic and safety profile study and received 2 single 0.8-mg/kg doses of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride oral solution), 1 after a 10-hour overnight fast and the other 30 minutes after the start of consumption of a high-fat breakfast, in a randomly assigned order. A washout period of at least 9 days separated the 2 treatment periods. Venous blood samples were taken before each dose and periodically for 72 hours after each dose for determination of concentrations of fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for each subject by noncompartmental analysis. In the 13 subjects completing both treatment periods, food had no effect on the rate or extent of absorption and bioavailability of fenfluramine as assessed by fed vs fasted adjusted geometric mean observed plasma Cmax (59.1 vs 56.7 ng/mL; NS) and AUC0-∞ (1640 vs 1600 ng · h/mL; NS). Additionally, there was no impact of food on systemic exposure of norfenfluramine. Seven subjects reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event; all treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in severity. The bioequivalence and tolerability of single 0.8-mg/kg oral doses of ZX008 in the fed and fasted states support ZX008 administration without regard to meals.

29948770	"Effect of Rufinamide on the kainic acid-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus
"	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a structurally unique anti-epileptic drug, used in the treatment of seizure disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the present study, we investigated whether RUF protected against excitotoxic neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region after intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection. Treatment with 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg RUF significantly decreased the KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA3 region in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 100 mg/kg RUF treatment reduced the KA-induced oxidative stress-related increase of MDA level and decrease of total SOD activity in the hippocampus. KA-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, levels as well as KA-induced microglial activation were also suppressed by RUF treatment. These results indicate that RUF displays a neuroprotective effect against KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

"	"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is still a significant cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, mental delay, and epilepsy. After the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia, the prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has improved, with reduction of death and disabilities. However, few studies evaluated whether hypothermia affects rate and severity of postneonatal epilepsy. We evaluated rates, characteristics and prognostic markers of postneonatal epilepsy in infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated or not with therapeutic hypothermia. We analyzed clinical data, EEG recordings, cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and outcome in 23 cooled and 26 non-cooled asphyxiated neonates (≥36 weeks' gestation), admitted from 2004 to 2012. Among 49 neonates 11 (22%) had postneonatal epilepsy, of which 9 (18%) were non-cooled and 2 (4%) were cooled (P=0.05). Six of 11 infants (55%) had West syndrome, 4 (36%) had focal epilepsy and 1 (9%) had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. At multiple logistic regression analysis MRI pattern significantly correlated with postneonatal epilepsy (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.88, P=0.03). Extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter were associated with postneonatal epilepsy. Only perinatal asphyxia with extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter lesion conveys a high risk for early and severe postneonatal epilepsy. Moreover, therapeutic hypothermia is associated with a decrease of the risk of developing postneonatal epilepsy.

"	"Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative treatment for medically intractable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that disrupts the interhemispheric synchronization of epileptiform discharges. However, traditional open corpus callosotomy carries a significant risk of surgical complications associated with craniotomy and a parafalcine approach to the corpus callosum. Here, we report 2 cases of anterior corpus callosotomy using MRI-guided stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) as a minimally invasive technique for mitigating the risks of craniotomy while achieving favorable outcomes. Two patients with medically intractable LGS underwent stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy using a 2 laser-fiber approach. Ablation of 70%-80% of the corpus callosum was confirmed by postoperative MRI diffusion tensor imaging and volumetric analysis. Marked reduction of epileptiform activity was observed in both patients during postoperative video-EEG studies as compared to preoperative video-EEG studies. Freedom from disabling seizures including drop attacks was achieved in 1 patient for 18 mo, and more than a 90% reduction of disabling seizures was achieved in the other patient for 7 mo with cognitive improvement and without surgical complications. These early data demonstrate the technical feasibility, safety, and favorable outcomes of MRI-guided stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy in patients with LGS, making it a potentially safe and effective alternative to traditional open corpus callosotomy and other stereotactic methods including radiofrequency ablation and radiosurgery due to the ability to monitor the ablation in real time with MRI.

30010275	"Short-term efficacy and safety of rufinamide for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"Objective: We examined the short-term efficacy and safety of rufinamide (RFN) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of clinical records of patients with LGS who started RFN treatment between July 2013 and June 2014 at the Hokkaido Medical Center for Child Health and Rehabilitation and Midorigaoka Ryo-iku-en. Efficacy and safety were evaluated when the patients had completed three months of treatment. Patients were classified into four categories according to percent seizure reduction : remission (seizure-free), response (seizure reduction≥50%), no change (seizure reduction<50% or increase) and aggravation (seizure increase≥50%). Responder rate (RR) was the percentage of patients with≥50% decrease in seizure frequency. Results: Thirteen LGS patients (8 males, 5 females) were studied. The efficacy for tonic seizures (13 patients) was remission 1 patient, response 3 patients, no change 8 patients and aggravation 1 patient, with RR of 30.8%. Two patients discontinued LGS due to seizure aggravation. Four patients experienced transient remission. For generalized tonic clonic seizures (2 patients), 1 patient achieved remission and 1 patient showed no change. Two patients of atonic seizures showed no change. Of 2 patients of atypical absence, 1 patient showed response and 1 patient no change. Eight patients had adverse effects such as somnolence (6 patients), sleep disturbance (1 patient), and appetite loss (4 patients) including weight loss in 2 patients. There were no severe adverse effects and no discontinuation due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Short-term effectiveness for tonic seizures was observed when patients with LGS were treated with RFN, with transient remission in some patients. We consider that RFN is worth trying in patients with LGS due to its efficacy for tonic seizures and absence of severe adverse effects.

30017619	"Multifocal epilepsy in children is associated with increased long-distance functional connectivity: An explorative EEG-fMRI study
"	"Multifocal epileptic activity is an unfavourable feature of a number of epileptic syndromes (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome, severe focal epilepsies) which suggests an overall vulnerability of the brain to pathological synchronization. However, the mechanisms of multifocal activity are insufficiently understood. This explorative study investigates whether pathological connectivity within brain areas of the default mode network as well as thalamus, brainstem and retrosplenial cortex may predispose individuals to multifocal epileptic activity. 33 children suffering from multifocal and monofocal (control group) epilepsies were investigated using EEG-fMRI recordings during sleep. The blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal of 15 regions of interest was extracted and temporally correlated (resting-state functional connectivity). Patients with monofocal epilepsies were characterized by strong correlations between the corresponding interhemispheric homotopic regions. This pattern of correlations with pronounced short-distance and weak long-distance functional connectivity resembles the connectivity pattern described for healthy children. Patients with multifocal epileptic activity, however, demonstrated significantly stronger correlations between a large number of regions of the default mode network as well as thalamus and brainstem, with a significant increase in long-distance connectivity compared to children with monofocal epileptic activity. In the group of patients with multifocal epilepsies there were no differences in functional connectivity between patients with or without Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This explorative study shows that multifocal activity is associated with generally increased long-distance functional connectivity in the brain. It can be suggested that this pronounced connectivity may represent either a risk to pathological over-synchronization or a consequence of the multifocal epileptic activity.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant, childhood onset electroclinical epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types and diagnostic electroencephalogram findings. ZX008 (fenfluramine HCl oral solution) was well tolerated and reduced seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome, prompting this phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study of add-on ZX008 in patients with LGS (NCT02655198). Eligible treatment-refractory patients with LGS aged 3-18 years with ≥4 documented convulsive seizures (CS) in the prior 4 weeks were administered adjunctive ZX008 twice daily at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/d, with incremental dose escalations up to 0.8 mg/kg/d or 30 mg/d (maximum dose) every 4 weeks in nonresponders (<50% reduction in CS frequency). After 20 weeks (core study), responders were offered entry into a long-term extension study. Seizures were captured via diary. Cardiac safety was monitored by Doppler echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Thirteen patients were enrolled (mean age = 11.7 years, range = 3-17). Ten (77%) patients completed 20 weeks of ZX008 treatment. During the core study, there was a 53% median reduction (N = 13) in CS; median reduction was 60% in the 10 completers. Eight patients (62%) had a ≥50% CS reduction; three (23%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. Nine (69%) patients entered the long-term extension study. At 15 months (n = 9), median reduction in CS was 58%; six (67%) patients had a ≥50% reduction, and three (33%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (n = 4, 31%) and decreased alertness (n = 2, 15%). No echocardiographic signs of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension were observed. ZX008 provided clinically meaningful reduction (≥50%) in CS frequency in the majority of patients with LGS in this pilot study and was generally well tolerated. A phase 3, randomized, controlled study is ongoing.

This subgroup analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rufinamide tablets in LGS pediatric patients aged 1-4 years. This was a retrospective, observational study in LGS patients aged 1-4 years who received 12 weeks of treatment with rufinamide orally as an adjuvant treatment between April and June 2010. The proportion of responders (patients with a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency after rufinamide treatment) was evaluated according to the type of seizure. The proportion of patients who were seizure-free was also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment. Among the 15 patients evaluated, one discontinued treatment because of worsening seizures 4 weeks after administration of rufinamide. Seven (46.67%) patients were responders and four patients were seizure-free. There were four responders with convulsive seizures, one each for myoclonic seizures and drop attacks, and spasms. The responder rate was increased to 69.23% by long-term treatment of rufinamide. AEs were experienced by three patients. One patient each experienced somnolence, fatigue, and rash. Rufinamide tablets were efficacious and well tolerated in LGS patients aged 1-4 years, at doses up to 1000 mg per day, when given as add-on therapy to other antiepileptic drugs.

We reviewed the case reports of 90 patients with LGS who had undergone resective surgery between 2003 and 2014 at the Severance Children's Hospital and managed them for a minimum period of 2 years. At the time of surgery, the patients were between 3.0 and 23.5 years old (mean ± SD: 9.3 ± 4.4). The time from seizure onset to surgery ranged from 0.7 to 20.1 years (7.2 ± 4.3). On postoperative follow-up for an average period of 6.1 ± 2.2 years (range: 2.1-11.4 years), 45 patients (50.0%) had no seizures, and 15 (16.7%) reported infrequent seizures. Seizure-free outcomes were achieved in 15 of the 21 (71.4%) hemispherectomies, 23 of the 51 (45.1%) multilobar resections, and 7 of the 18 (38.9%) single lobar resections. On high-resolution MRIs, 20 patients (22.2%) had negative findings, 8 of whom (40.0%) became seizure-free after resective surgery. Malformation of cortical development was the most common pathologic finding and was noted in 57 patients (63.3%). Seizure-free patients achieved better adaptive behavior and social competence than did patients with persistent seizures at the second (2-3 years after surgery) and third (4-6 years after surgery) follow-ups, as indicated by social quotients (P < .05). Resective surgery is a viable option in some patients to treat seizures that are associated with LGS, with a high probability of seizure control and better adaptive function.

"	"The goal of this study was to assess the indications of revision for vagal nerve stimulation at a single institution in an adult population with drug-resistant epilepsy. This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database who underwent vagal nerve stimulator implantation for drug-resistant epilepsy during 1992-2017. Patients receiving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) implants were monitored throughout their perioperative and postoperative course and were classified according to type of seizure at the time of diagnosis and indications for VNS revision. In addition, response to dysfunctional VNS devices or adverse effects were noted. Most patients receiving VNS implants were given a diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPSs) before implantation (95.1%). Other epileptic conditions identified requiring implantation included generalized seizures, generalized-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, CPS or generalized seizures, and tuberous sclerosis (with generalized characteristics). High lead impedance was the most common indication for revision (5.6%), whereas device ineffectiveness leading to continued seizures was the most common indication for removal (2.3%). Infection, lead fracture, and dual- to single-pin lead battery changes occurred at an incidence of 1.9%, requiring either implant removal or revision. Other events that occurred, albeit rarely, included skin extrusion (0.5%), postoperative hematoma (0.5%), and implant rejection (0.5%) necessitating removal. VNS implantation in adults was shown to be a well-tolerated procedure. In addition, indications for revision or removal of the VNS device was low in this population with lead fracture rates lower than the incidence reported in pediatric population literature.

"	"There is overlap in the electroclinical features of many childhood epilepsy syndromes, especially those presenting with multiple seizure types, such as epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). This study aimed to determine the frequency of diagnosis switching and the factors influencing epilepsy syndrome diagnosis in a cohort of children with possible EMAS, as well as to explore the relationship between epilepsy syndrome diagnoses, key electroclinical features, and clinically relevant outcomes. This is a cross-sectional retrospective chart review of children treated at the Children's Hospital of Colorado with a potential diagnosis of EMAS. There were 77 patients that met eligibility criteria, including 39% (n = 30) with an initial diagnosis of EMAS and 74% (n = 57) with a final diagnosis of EMAS. On average, for the 65% of patients who received more than one epilepsy diagnosis, the first, second, and third diagnoses were received within one year, three years, and ten years after epilepsy onset, respectively. Final diagnosis was significantly related to obtaining at least a six-month period of seizure freedom, p = 0.03. Classic LGS traits, including paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike-and-wave, and tonic seizures were present in 50% of the overall cohort, although a minority of these patients had a final diagnosis of LGS. However, the presence of more LGS traits was associated with a higher likelihood of ongoing seizures. Adjusted for age of epilepsy onset, seizure freedom was half as likely for every additional LGS trait observed (0.49[0.31, 0.77], p = 0.002). Current epilepsy syndrome classification has reduced applicability due to overlapping features. This results in diagnosis switching and limited prognostic value for patients with an overlapping clinical phenotype. Future studies should attempt to stratify patients based not only on epilepsy syndrome diagnosis, but also on the presence of various electroclinical traits to more accurately predict outcome.

Neurologic examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and repeated prolonged electroencephalography (EEG) or video-EEG studies were performed in all cases. Data on school achievements and/or neuropsychological evaluations were obtained during the follow-up of 1-3 years. Sulthiame was added in doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg/kg/day. Twenty-seven of 44 patients (61%) who received sulthiame as add-on therapy had a greater than 50% seizure decrease after a mean follow-up period of 20 months. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in one patient (2%). Four patients (9%) had a 25-50% seizure decrease, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in 12 (25%), and was increased in one (2%). Hyperpnoea and dyspnoea were observed in four patients, and nausea, drowsiness, and headache were seen in one patient each; however, these manifestations were transient and discontinuation of sulthiame was not necessary. Two other patients had decreased appetite, skin rash, and irritability. The adverse effects were mild and transient in these nine cases. Sulthiame as an adjunctive therapy achieved a more than 50% seizure reduction in 27 of 44 patients with LGS with only mild or moderate adverse effects.

Study 303 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01405053) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial. Patients were randomized (2:1) to oral suspension rufinamide (≤45 mg/kg/day) or any other investigator-chosen antiepileptic drug (AED) for a 2-year treatment period. Primary safety/tolerability assessments included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs. Behavioral effects were assessed via the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) using the Total Problems score and change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems score. CBCL subscores were also evaluated. The Safety Analysis Set included 37 patients (rufinamide: n = 25; any other AED: n = 12). TEAE incidence was similar between the rufinamide (88.0%) and any-other-AED groups (83.3%); serious TEAE incidence was also similar between treatment groups (40.0% and 41.7%, respectively). Between treatment groups, the difference in the least squares mean CBCL Total Problems score across time was not significant (p = 0.7083), behavior outcomes were similar across all endpoints, and there were no consistent trends in CBCL subscores. Long-term (2 years) adjunctive rufinamide was well tolerated in pediatric patients with LGS. Behavioral outcomes were comparable between the rufinamide and any-other-AED groups, however the small sample size and difficulties assessing behavior in this population should be noted. The challenges of this study raise the issue of revising how studies in very young children with rare and complex epilepsies are performed.

"	"Phase I, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 3-period crossover study assessing pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of ZX008, a liquid oral formulation of fenfluramine (FFA) under development for adjunctive treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, administered with and without a combined antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen of stiripentol (STP), valproate (VPA), and clobazam (CLB) (STP regimen). 26 healthy adults were administered the following treatments: ZX008 0.8 mg/kg; STP 3,500 mg, CLB 20 mg, VPA 25 mg/kg (max. 1,500 mg); and ZX008 0.8 mg/kg + STP regimen. Dose periods were 17 days apart. Blood samples were obtained for 72 hours after drug administration and used to calculate non-compartmental PK parameters. Statistical bioequivalence-type analysis demonstrated ZX008 had no significant impact on the PK of any drug in the STP regimen, while the STP regimen moderately affected FFA PK. The 3-drug combination increased the geometric mean Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf of FFA while reducing the Cmax and AUC0-t of its major metabolite, norfenfluramine (norFFA). Adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate and resolved spontaneously. ZX008 + STP regimen co-administration to healthy adult subjects modestly impacted the number but not severity of AEs. Results show that the STP regimen had a moderate impact on FFA and norFFA PK and ZX008 had no significant impact on the 3 STP regimen drugs. ZX008 would not be expected to alter the clinical response of patients to this regimen by means of an effect on PK. When administering these drugs together, a downward dose adjustment of ZX008 may be warranted. .

"	"We report a child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with an increase in seizure frequency and loss of psychomotor skills due to a disintegrated cervical VNS lead, not detected during standard device monitoring. The lead was completely removed and replaced by a new 303 lead on the same nerve segment. After reinitiating VNS, side effects forced us to switch it off, resulting in immediate seizure recurrence. EEG recording demonstrated a non-convulsive status epilepticus that was halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Thereafter, he remained seizure free for eight months, and regained psychomotor development.

"	"The Fourteenth Eilat Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs and Devices (EILAT XIV) took place in Madrid, Spain, on May 13-16, 2018 and was attended by 168 delegates from 28 countries. The conference provided a forum for professionals involved in basic science, clinical research, regulatory affairs, and clinical care to meet and discuss the latest advances related to discovery and development of drugs and devices aimed at improving the management of people with epilepsy. This progress report provides a summary of findings on investigational compounds for which data from both preclinical studies and studies in patients were presented. The compounds reviewed include anakinra, cannabidiol, cannabidivarin, fenfluramine, ganaxolone, medium-chain fatty acids, padsevonil, and the valproic derivatives valnoctamide and sec-butylpropylacetamide. On June 25, 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a standardized formulation of cannabidiol oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years and older. The report shows that there continues to be a steady flow of potential antiepileptic drugs progressing to clinical development. Many of these compounds show innovative mechanisms of action, and some have already been tested in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials, with promising efficacy and safety results.

30403281	"Ten years' experience with vagus nerve stimulation in a paediatric population
"	"Fifty million people are affected by epilepsy. Up to 30% are not controlled with the aid of antiepileptic drugs. The vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is a therapeutic alternative that must be taken into account. To determine the effect of the VNS in a cohort of paediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. A retrospective study of children with a VNS implanted between 2008 and 2017 in a tertiary hospital. Epidemiological, aetiological, clinical and electrophysiological data, along with VNS parameters were analysed. The study included 35 patients, with a mean age when the VNS was implanted of 12.84 years (range: 3.1-18.7 years) and a mean time between onset of epilepsy and implantation of 7.2 years (range: 1.3-17.7 years). The causation was structural in 62.9% of cases. The most frequent epileptic conditions were: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and focal epilepsy, with a predominance of tonic seizures (57.1%). The video electroencephalogram showed multifocal anomalies (54%) and a pattern of epileptic encephalopathies (34.3%). Intellectual disability was associated in 94% of the cases. The mean of previous antiepileptic drugs was 9.6 ± 3 (range: 4-16). 43% responded to treatment (>= 50% reduction in number of seizures), with a mean reduction of 67.3%, which improved with higher ages of onset of epilepsy. Three patients were seizure-free (8.5%). The number of seizures decreased by 33% at six months and by 47.4% at 24 months. There was also a notable degree of cognitive (57%) and behavioural improvement (53%). In 28% of cases there were some side effects, but in general they were mild. The VNS is a valid option in refractory epilepsy, with improvements not only in terms of seizures but also regarding cognitive-behavioural aspects, this being very important for the paediatric population.

"	"Neurological therapeutics have been hampered by its inability to advance beyond symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders into the realm of actual palliation, arrest or reversal of the attendant pathological processes. While cannabis-based medicines have demonstrated safety, efficacy and consistency sufficient for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges remain. This review will examine the intriguing promise that recent discoveries regarding cannabis-based medicines offer to neurological therapeutics by incorporating the neutral phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and cannabis terpenoids in the putative treatment of five syndromes, currently labeled recalcitrant to therapeutic success, and wherein improved pharmacological intervention is required: intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current basic science and clinical investigations support the safety and efficacy of such interventions in treatment of these currently intractable conditions, that in some cases share pathological processes, and the plausibility of interventions that harness endocannabinoid mechanisms, whether mediated via direct activity on CB1 and CB2 (tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, caryophyllene), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ; THCA), 5-HT1A (CBD, CBDA) or even nutritional approaches utilizing prebiotics and probiotics. The inherent polypharmaceutical properties of cannabis botanicals offer distinct advantages over the current single-target pharmaceutical model and portend to revolutionize neurological treatment into a new reality of effective interventional and even preventative treatment.

"	"There is great potential in the synthetic development of rufinamide to treat childhood-onset epilepsy known as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Areas covered: 1,4-disubstituted triazole ring formed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction is an important structural motif widely used to construct diverse chemotypes in chemical, biological, and material fields. 1,2,3-triazole ring containing rufinamide, an antiepileptic drug developed by Novartis, is useful in combination with other antiepileptic medicaments for the treatment of childhood-onset epilepsy known as LGS. There are numerous synthetic methods used to construct the rufinamide through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The application claims processes for the preparation of rufinamide and their intermediates. The synthetic strategy covered for the synthesis of rufinamide using activated acetylenic esters. The activation is done using N-hydroxy succinimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, 1-hydroxy benzotriazole, and 4-nitro phenol. Expert opinion: The manufacturing route appears to follow the regioselective Cu catalyzed cycloaddtion of 2,6-difluro benzyl azide with or without isolated activated acetylenic esters in three steps that provide a good lead for new synthetic strategy for the rufinamide synthesis.

The Refractory Epilepsy Screening Tool for LGS (REST-LGS) was developed to improve the identification of patients with LGS. Using the Modified Delphi Consensus, a group of experts developed and tested the REST-LGS Case Report Form (CRF) comprising 8 criteria (4 major, 4 minor) considered potentially indicative of LGS. Diagnosis-blinded specialist and nonspecialist raters at 2 epilepsy centers applied the CRF to deidentified patient records, including 1:1 records of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy or confirmed LGS. Interrater reliability was measured by Cohen's κ. Diagnosis was then unblinded to reveal common criteria for LGS or drug-resistant epilepsy. Cronbach's α was used to measure internal consistency between raters for all criteria combined. Of 200 patients, 81% to 85% met 1 to 3 major criteria. At both sites, moderate (κ, 0.41-0.60) to good (κ, 0.61-0.80) agreement on most criteria was reached between expert and nonexpert raters. Unblinding revealed that most patients with LGS met 3 major and 2 to 3 minor criteria, while patients with drug-resistant epilepsy met ≤1 major and only 1 to 2 minor criteria. Cronbach's α of raters at both sites was 0.64. The combined number of major/minor criteria on the CRF may be particularly indicative of LGS. Therefore, the REST-LGS may be a valuable clinical tool in identifying patients requiring further diagnostic evaluation for LGS.

30554497	"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in Mitochondrial Disease
"	"Previous studies have shown that neurologic symptoms are dominant in patients with mitochondrial diseases, and most of these patients have seizure-related disorders. The epileptic classification of these patients as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is as high as 25%. This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations, diagnoses, treatments, and epilepsy in LGS, which is associated with mitochondrial disease. A retrospective study was conducted on 372 patients who were diagnosed with mitochondrial disease between 2006 and 2016. Of these 372 patients, 40 patients diagnosed with LGS were selected, and they were classified into two groups based on the history of West syndrome. Patient characteristics were reviewed, and associations between clinical factors and outcomes after the treatment were analyzed. The proportion of individuals with mitochondrial disease with LGS with a history of West syndrome was 32.5%. Among the patients with mitochondrial disease with LGS, neonatal seizure (p=0.029), seizure as the first symptom (p=0.018), and generalized paroxysmal fast activity frequency on electroencephalogram (p=0.018) in the group with a history of West syndrome were statistically significantly high. The first symptom onset (0.6±0.4 yrs vs. 1.6±0.9 yrs, p=0.003) and first seizure onset (0.9±0.7 yrs vs. 3.9±3.1 yrs, p<0.001) were significantly faster in patients with a history of West syndrome. Close monitoring of the medical condition and early intervention might improve the prognosis of individuals with mitochondrial disease with LGS and a history of West syndrome.

"	"We describe the clinical features and outcome in patients with late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Adult patients evaluated between January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2017, who presented with onset of LGS ≥10 years were identified. Data abstracted included age at seizure onset, seizure types, etiology, treatments, EEG and neuroimaging results, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and autoimmune evaluation. Ten patients (8 females) were identified. The mean age at onset of seizures consistent with LGS was 16.5 years (range, 10-32 years). Seizure types included tonic, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures (all), myoclonic seizures (n = 3), and atypical absence seizures (n = 7). Five patients had normal intellectual function at onset. Prolonged video-EEG monitoring recorded seizures and generalized interictal epileptiform discharges in all. All patients had drug-resistant epilepsy (range of antiseizure drugs tried, 7-16). Two patients had a history of intrathecal methotrexate to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two patients had malformations of cortical development. CSF analysis (n = 5) showed a mild elevation in the protein level without other abnormalities. Autoantibody determinations in the serum (n = 4) or the CSF (n = 5) and genetic testing (n = 5) were negative. At final follow-up, all but 1 patient was disabled and required a caregiver, and none were driving. One patient died of probable sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Late-onset LGS represents a rare, treatment-resistant generalized epilepsy that is disabling and may be associated with progressive cognitive impairment. The elevated CSF protein level in our cohort could have been due to high seizure burden but increases the possibility of an inflammatory component to the pathophysiology of this disorder.

"	"To review the efficacy, safety, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of pure, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD; Epidiolex) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Relevant information was identified through EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2018). Product labeling and https://www.clinicaltrials.gov were also reviewed. English language articles evaluating efficacy and safety in humans with treatment-resistant epilepsies were reviewed; additional pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies in humans, animals, and in vitro were also included. Pure, plant-based CBD is a pharmaceutical grade extract that exhibits clinically significant antiseizure properties, with a hypothesized multimodal mechanism of action. In the GWPCARE trial series, CBD displayed superior efficacy in reducing key seizure frequencies (convulsive seizures in DS; drop seizures in LGS) by 17% to 23% compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs in patients 2 years of age and older. Common adverse effects were somnolence, diarrhea, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Noteworthy drug-drug interactions included clobazam, valproates, and significant inducers/inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 enzymes. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: A discussion regarding CBD dosing, administration, adverse effects, monitoring parameters, and interactions is provided to guide clinicians. CBD offers patients with DS and LGS a new treatment option for refractory seizures. This is the first cannabis-derived medication with approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. This CBD formulation significantly reduces seizures as an adjunct to standard antiepileptic therapies in patients ≥2 years old with DS and LGS and is well tolerated.

Herein we present an interim analysis of the safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes from this trial. Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD oral solution (Epidiolex; 100 mg/mL), titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg/d over a 2-week titration period, in addition to their existing medications. Doses could be reduced if not tolerated or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d if thought to be of benefit. This interim analysis was based on a November 2016 data cut. Of 368 patients who completed treatment in GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4, 366 (99.5%) enrolled in the OLE study (GWPCARE5). Median treatment duration was 38 weeks at a mean modal dose of 23 mg/kg/d. Most patients (92.1%) experienced adverse events (AEs), primarily of mild (32.5%) or moderate (43.4%) severity. The most common AEs were diarrhea (26.8%), somnolence (23.5%), and convulsion (21.3%). Thirty-five patients (9.6%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Liver transaminase elevations were reported in 37 patients (10.1%), of whom 29 were receiving concomitant valproic acid; 34 cases resolved spontaneously or with dose modification of CBD or concomitant medication. Median reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency (quantified monthly over 12-week periods) ranged from 48% to 60% through week 48. Median reduction in monthly total seizure frequency ranged from 48% to 57% across all 12-week periods through week 48. Eighty-eight percent of patients/caregivers reported an improvement in the patient's overall condition per the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale. In this study, long-term add-on CBD treatment had an acceptable safety profile in patients with LGS and led to sustained reductions in seizures.

Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2-55 years) who had had 2 or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg/kg (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in 2 equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group ( P = .005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group, and P = .002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560.)

Epilepsia. 2018;59(8):1540-1548. Since 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded access program (EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP patients treated through December 2016. Twenty-five US-based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2 to 10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2 to 4 weeks through 16 weeks and every 2 to 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy end points included the percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency and percentage of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in seizures versus baseline. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for missing data. Adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit. Of 607 patients in the safety data set, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most common reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was 13 years (range, 0.4-62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0-10). Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add-on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by 48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%). Results from this ongoing EAP support previous observational and clinical trial data, showing that add-on CBD may be an efficacious long-term treatment option for TRE. Randomized, Dose-Ranging Safety Trial of Cannabidiol in Dravet Syndrome Devinsky O, Patel AD, Thiele EA, et al; GWPCARE1 Part A Study Group. Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1204-e1211. To evaluate the safety and preliminary pharmacokinetics of a pharmaceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol (CBD) in children with Dravet syndrome. Patients aged 4 to 10 years were randomized 4:1 to CBD (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d) or placebo taken twice daily. The double-blind trial comprised 4-week baseline, 3-week treatment (including titration), 10-day taper, and 4-week follow-up periods. Completers could continue in an open-label extension. Multiple pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken on the first day of dosing and at end of treatment for measurement of CBD, its metabolites 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; clobazam and metabolite N-desmethylclobazam [N-CLB], valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol). Safety assessments were clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse events (AEs), seizure frequency, and suicidality. Thirty-four patients were randomized (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups and 7 to placebo); 32 (94%) completed treatment. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites was dose proportional (AUC0-t). Cannabidiol did not affect concomitant AED levels, apart from an increase in N-CLB (except in patients taking stiripentol). The most common AEs on CBD were pyrexia, somnolence, decreased appetite, sedation, vomiting, ataxia, and abnormal behavior. Six patients taking CBD and valproate developed elevated transaminases; none met criteria for drug-induced liver injury and all recovered. No other clinically relevant safety signals were observed. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites increased proportionally with dose. An interaction with N-CLB was observed, likely related to CBD inhibition of cytochrome P450 subtype 2C19. Cannabidiol resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated. This study provides class I evidence that for children with Dravet syndrome, CBD resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.

"	"We report the anesthetic management of 2 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presenting for respective epilepsy surgery with intraoperative electrocorticography. Electrocorticography is a useful tool to guide the localization of the epileptogenic focus for surgical resection in epilepsy surgery. Drug interactions, proconvulsant or anticonvulsant activity of the anesthetics, and anesthetic influence on intraoperative electrocorticography are the primary concerns to be addressed in these patients. We observed that dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia facilitates intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring. Dexmedetomidine, by decreasing the requirements of other anesthetic agents, offers better recovery profile and pain relief with minimal respiratory depression in patients undergoing disconnective epilepsy surgeries.

"	"Since 2014, patients with severe treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) have been receiving add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in an ongoing, expanded access program (EAP), which closely reflects clinical practice. We conducted an interim analysis of long-term efficacy and tolerability in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) who received CBD treatment through December 2016. Children and adults with LGS/DS taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included from 25 EAP sites across the United States. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD (Epidiolex®; 100 mg/mL) in oral solution at 2-10 mg/kg/day, titrated until tolerability limit or a maximum dose of 25-50 mg/kg/day. Patient visits were every 2-4 weeks. The percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive (ie, major motor) and total seizures was evaluated at 12-week intervals through 96 weeks. The percentages of patients who had ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reduction in monthly seizures relative to the baseline period were also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and summarized for the safety analysis set (SAS) through 144 weeks. Of the 607 patients in the SAS, 58 had DS and 94 had LGS (N = 152); 455 patients had other TREs. Twenty-eight percent of LGS/DS patients withdrew, primarily owing to lack of efficacy (20%). LGS/DS patients were taking a median of 3 (0-10) concomitant AEDs. Median treatment duration was 78.3 (range, 4.1-146.4) weeks. Between weeks 12 and 96, median CBD dose ranged from 21 to 25 mg/kg/day. At 12 weeks, add-on CBD reduced median monthly major motor seizures by 50% and total seizures by 44%, with consistent reductions in both seizure types through 96 weeks. At 12 weeks, the proportions of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in major motor seizures were 53%, 23%, and 6%; the proportions with corresponding reductions in total seizures were 46%, 26%, and 5%. Responder rates for both seizure types were consistent through 96 weeks. CBD had an acceptable safety profile; the most common AEs were somnolence (30%) and diarrhea (24%). Results from this interim analysis support add-on CBD as an effective long-term treatment option in LGS or DS.

31082204	"Evaluation of Selective 5-HT2C  Agonists in Acute Seizure Models
"	"The 5-HT releaser/reuptake inhibitor fenfluramine has been recently reported to provide benefit as an adjunctive treatment for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, two types of severe childhood epilepsy. Despite its enhancement of 5-HT function, many effects of fenfluramine have been demonstrated to be dependent on 5-HT2C receptor activation, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptor activation may have an anticonvulsant property. The present study was designed to evaluate fenfluramine and 5-HT agonists of varying 5-HT2C agonist selectivity, the relatively nonselective mCPP and Ro 60-0175, and the selective 5-HT2C agonists lorcaserin and CP-809101 across a variety of acute seizure tests conducted in adult rats and mice, which have been instrumental in identifying the majority of clinically efficacious antiepileptic drugs. Tests included the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), MES threshold, and 6 Hz electrical convulsive seizure models and the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole test. The effect of mCPP, lorcaserin, and CP-809101 against electrically evoked seizures in amygdala kindled rats was also investigated. Overall, at doses known to interact with 5-HT2CR, there was no clear class-related effect of these agonists in any test. The only notable antiseizure effect of fenfluramine was inhibition of MES-induced tonic seizures in the rat. The current preclinical studies using the classical acute seizure tests and an amygdala kindling model do not identify a reliable antiseizure effect of fenfluramine, an agent now used in the treatment of human epilepsies, including Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Given the nature of these epilepsies, early life and/or genetic models may have better construct validity and be more appropriate for further study.

"	"We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with trisomy 21 and infantile spasms in our university-based pediatric epilepsy center between 2002 and 2016 in order to describe the clinical characteristics of children with these diagnoses as well as to evaluate their response to first-line treatments. Patients with infantile spasms were identified via the neurophysiology database. Charts were reviewed with attention to infantile spasms diagnosis, presence of trisomy 21, age of reported clinical onset, treatment lag, treatments used, response to treatment, imaging findings, electroencephalography (EEG) data, and developmental outcomes. Of the 310 patients with infantile spasms, 24 also had trisomy 21. Three patients did not meet inclusion criteria. Ten of the 21 patients received nonstandard therapies first line; 2 of the 10 (20%) achieved spasm control, and 4 of the 8 who failed therapy (50%) progressed to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eleven of the 21 patients received standard therapies as first-line treatments (10 with prednisolone according to the protocol in the United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study [UKISS] and 1 with adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACTH]). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) who received prednisolone achieved spasm resolution, 6 (60%) of these without relapse. The final patient (10%) failed prednisolone as well as ACTH. One patient received ACTH first line with success. This is the only series to follow children with trisomy 21 and infantile spasms in which a significant proportion received UKISS-protocol prednisolone. It adds to current knowledge about safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of prednisolone in this group.

"	"Currently, there is a great interest in the potential medical use of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid. Productive pharmacological research on CBD occurred in the 1970s and intensified recently with many discoveries about the endocannabinoid system. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies led to FDA-approval of Epidiolex®, a purified CBD medicine formulated for oral administration for the treatment of infantile refractory epileptic syndromes, by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018. The World Health Organization considers rescheduling cannabis and cannabinoids. CBD use around the world is expanding for diseases that lack scientific evidence of the drug's efficacy. Preclinical and clinical studies also report adverse effects (AEs) and toxicity following CBD intake. Relevant studies reporting CBD's AEs or toxicity were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE through January 2019. Studies defining CBD's beneficial effects were included to provide balance in estimating risk/benefit. CBD is not risk-free. In animals, CBD AEs included developmental toxicity, embryo-fetal mortality, central nervous system inhibition and neurotoxicity, hepatocellular injuries, spermatogenesis reduction, organ weight alterations, male reproductive system alterations, and hypotension, although at doses higher than recommended for human pharmacotherapies. Human CBD studies for epilepsy and psychiatric disorders reported CBD-induced drug-drug interactions, hepatic abnormalities, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and somnolence. CBD has proven therapeutic efficacy for serious conditions such as Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and is likely to be recommended off label by physicians for other conditions. However, AEs and potential drug-drug interactions must be taken into consideration by clinicians prior to recommending off-label CBD.

"	"Mutations in SLC6A1 have been associated mainly with myoclonic atonic epilepsy (MAE) and intellectual disability. We identified a novel missense mutation in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) characterized by severe seizures and developmental delay. Exome Sequencing was performed in an epilepsy patient cohort. The impact of the mutation was evaluated by 3H γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake, structural modeling, live cell microscopy, cell surface biotinylation and a high-throughput assay flow cytometry in both neurons and non neuronal cells. We discovered a heterozygous missense mutation (c700G to A [pG234S) in the SLC6A1 encoding GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). Structural modeling suggests the mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation. With transient expression of enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) tagged rat GAT-1 cDNAs, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) transporter had reduced total protein expression in both rat cortical neurons and HEK 293 T cells. With a high-throughput flow cytometry assay and live cell surface biotinylation, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) had reduced cell surface expression. 3H radioactive labeling GABA uptake assay in HeLa cells indicated a reduced function of the mutant GAT-1(G234S). This mutation caused instability of the mutant transporter protein, which resulted in reduced cell surface and total protein levels. The mutation also caused reduced GABA uptake in addition to reduced protein expression, leading to reduced GABA clearance, and altered GABAergic signaling in the brain. The impaired trafficking and reduced GABA uptake function may explain the epilepsy phenotype in the patient.

"	"Compound heterozygotes occur when different variants at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of variants at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 Genomes Project participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or infantile spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 Genomes Project data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 Genomes Project participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous variants in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development - PRTG (p = 0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p = 0.022, 1% MAF, combined ancestries) and MACF1 (p = 0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due to the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous variants should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.

Whole-brain event-related analysis determined GPFA-related activation in each group. Results were used as priors in a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis comparing evidence for different neuronal hypotheses describing initiation and propagation of GPFA between cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. A total of 1,045 GPFA events were analyzed (cumulative duration 1,433 seconds). In both pediatric and older groups, activation occurred in distributed association cortical areas, as well as the thalamus and brainstem (p < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error). Activation was similar across individual patients with structural, genetic, and unknown etiologies of epilepsy, particularly in frontoparietal cortex. In both groups, DCM revealed that GPFA was most likely driven by prefrontal cortex, with propagation occurring first to the brainstem and then from brainstem to thalamus. We show reproducible evidence of a cortically driven process within the epileptic network of LGS. This network is present early (in children) and late (in older patients) in the course of the syndrome and across diverse etiologies of epilepsy, suggesting that LGS reflects shared ""secondary network"" involvement. A cortical-to-subcortical hierarchy is postulated whereby GPFA rapidly propagates from prefrontal cortex to the brainstem via extrapyramidal corticoreticular pathways, whereas the thalamus is engaged secondarily.

31307608	"Generalized epilepsies
"	"Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are characterized by normal background EEG activity and generalized interictal spike-and-wave discharges in the absence of any evidence of brain lesion. Absence epilepsies are the prototypes of IGEs. In childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies, by definition, all patients manifest absence seizures associated with an EEG pattern of generalized spike-wave (GSW) discharges. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, myoclonic jerks, usually affecting shoulders and arms bilaterally and appearing upon awakening, are the most characteristic clinical feature. Myoclonic jerks are accompanied on the EEG by generalized spike/polyspike-and-wave (GSW, GPWS) complexes at 3.5-6Hz. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only is a broad and nonspecific category including all patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and an interictal EEG pattern of GSW discharges. Despite the strong heritability and the recent advances in genetic technology, the genetic basis of IGEs remains largely elusive and only in a small minority of patients with classic IGE phenotypes is a monogenic cause identified. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), early infantile encephalopathy with suppression bursts, West syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, once classified among the generalized epilepsies, are now considered to be epileptic encephalopathies. Among them, only Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is characterized by prominent generalized clinical and EEG features.

"	"Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-euphorigenic compound derived from Cannabis, shows promise for improving recovery following cerebral ischemia and has recently been shown effective for the treatment of childhood seizures caused by Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Given evidence for activity to mitigate effects of CNS insult and dysfunction, we considered the possibility that CBD may also protect and improve functional recovery of a complex learned behavior. To test this hypothesis, we have applied a songbird, the adult male zebra finch, as a novel pre-clinical animal model. Their learned vocalizations were temporarily disrupted with bilateral microlesions of HVC (used as a proper name) a pre-vocal motor cortical-like brain region that drives song. These microlesions destroy about 10% of HVC, and temporarily impair song production, syntax and phonology for about seven days. Recovery requires sensorimotor learning as it depends upon auditory feedback. Four CBD doses (0, 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg) within three surgery conditions (microlesion, no-microlesion, sham-microlesion) were evaluated (n = 5-6). Birds were recorded over 20 days: three baseline; six pre-microlesion drug treatment days and; 11 post-microlesion treatment and recovery days. Results indicate 10 and 100 mg/kg CBD effectively reduced the time required to recover vocal phonology and syntax. In the case of phonology, the magnitude of microlesion-related disruptions were also reduced. These results suggest CBD holds promise to improve functional recovery of complex learned behaviors following brain injury, and represent establishment of an important new animal model to screen drugs for efficacy to improve vocal recovery.

The patient has a history of infantile spasms evolving into drug-resistant epilepsy with underlying epileptic encephalopathy consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. While at the extreme end of the spectrum, his phenotype is consistent with those previously described. Our literature review highlights the wide range of phenotypes exhibited by those with diseases related to IRF2BPL gene variants. This article also briefly discusses other comorbidities seen in the patient and those previously reported. While the molecular underpinnings of the role of IRF2BPL gene in the central nervous system are newly established, the specifics of its effects elsewhere have yet to be delineated. Furthermore, its pathogenesis in other organ systems is not yet understood and could be of importance from a management perspective.

31435640	"Synaptic clustering differences due to different GABRB3 mutations cause variable epilepsy syndromes
"	"GABRB3 is highly expressed early in the developing brain, and its encoded β3 subunit is critical for GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking as well as stem cell differentiation in embryonic brain. To date, over 400 mutations or variants have been identified in GABRB3. Mutations in GABRB3 have been increasingly recognized as a major cause for severe paediatric epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and infantile spasms with intellectual disability as well as relatively mild epilepsy syndromes such as childhood absence epilepsy. There is no plausible molecular pathology for disease phenotypic heterogeneity. Here we used a very high-throughput flow cytometry assay to evaluate the impact of multiple human mutations in GABRB3 on receptor trafficking. In this study we found that surface expression of mutant β3 subunits is variable. However, it was consistent that surface expression of partnering γ2 subunits was lower when co-expressed with mutant than with wild-type subunits. Because γ2 subunits are critical for synaptic GABAA receptor clustering, this provides an important clue for understanding the pathophysiology of GABRB3 mutations. To validate our findings further, we obtained an in-depth comparison of two novel mutations [GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K)] associated with epilepsy with different severities of epilepsy phenotype. GABRB3 (N328D) is associated with the relatively severe Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GABRB3 (E357K) is associated with the relatively mild juvenile absence epilepsy syndrome. With functional characterizations in both heterologous cells and rodent cortical neurons by patch-clamp recordings, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting, we found that both the GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K) mutations reduced total subunit expression in neurons but not in HEK293T cells. Both mutant subunits, however, were reduced on the cell surface and in synapses, but the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome mutant β3 (N328D) subunit was more reduced than the juvenile absence epilepsy mutant β3 (E357K) subunit. Interestingly, both mutant β3 subunits impaired postsynaptic clustering of wild-type GABAA receptor γ2 subunits and prevented γ2 subunits from incorporating into GABAA receptors at synapses, although by different cellular mechanisms. Importantly, wild-type γ2 subunits were reduced and less clustered at inhibitory synapses in Gabrb3+/- knockout mice. This suggests that impaired receptor localization to synapses is a common pathophysiological mechanism for GABRB3 mutations, although the extent of impairment may be different among mutant subunits. The study thus identifies the novel mechanism of impaired targeting of receptors containing mutant β3 subunits and provides critical insights into understanding how GABRB3 mutations produce severe epilepsy syndromes and epilepsy phenotypic heterogeneity.

"	"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are genetically heterogeneous severe childhood-onset epilepsies with developmental delay or cognitive deficits. In this study, we explored the pathogenic mechanisms of DEE-associated de novo mutations in the CACNA1A gene. We studied the functional impact of four de novo DEE-associated CACNA1A mutations, including the previously described p.A713T variant and three novel variants (p.V1396M, p.G230V, and p.I1357S). Mutant cDNAs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted to test the impacts on CaV 2.1 channel function. Channel localization and structure were assessed with immunofluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) modeling. We find that the G230V and I1357S mutations result in loss-of-function effects with reduced whole-cell current densities and decreased channel expression at the cell membrane. By contrast, the A713T and V1396M variants resulted in gain-of-function effects with increased whole-cell currents and facilitated current activation (hyperpolarized shift). The A713T variant also resulted in slower current decay. 3D modeling predicts conformational changes favoring channel opening for A713T and V1396M. Our findings suggest that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function CACNA1A mutations are associated with similarly severe DEEs and that functional validation is required to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and to guide therapies.

"	"The goal of this study was to characterize the drug-drug interactions between clobazam and 2 antiseizure drugs, cannabidiol and stiripentol, for treatment of refractory seizures through the use of pharmacokinetic modeling. A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was developed to characterize the combined effect of clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (i.e., N-clobazam), on seizure protection in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using data from the phase 3 CONTAIN trial. Drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cannabidiol were examined by comparing model-generated data to data from a study of 13 patients taking concomitant clobazam and cannabidiol. Modeling data were also descriptively compared with studies of patients administered both clobazam and stiripentol. Sedation-related adverse events from CONTAIN were analyzed to determine the exposure-somnolence relationship of clobazam. Exposure-efficacy analysis from the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model using CONTAIN data indicated that clobazam (half-maximal effective concentration [EC50], 303 ng/mL) was 3 times more potent than N-clobazam (EC50, 899 ng/mL). After administration of clobazam, when both clobazam and N-clobazam concentrations were each 1 to 2 times the EC50 value (clobazam dose, 20 mg), 70.0%-74.9% seizure protection was predicted; when concentrations were >2 times the EC50 value (clobazam dose, 40 mg), 74.0%-96.9% seizure protection was predicted. Generalized additive model analyses demonstrated decreased seizure probability with higher plasma concentration of clobazam. Coadministration of stiripentol and clobazam resulted in increased respective median plasma concentrations of clobazam and N-clobazam (1.1-1.2 times and 5.2-8.2 times) compared with administration of placebo and clobazam. Probability of somnolence significantly increased with age and higher N-clobazam plasma concentration. Awareness of drug-drug interactions between clobazam and cannabidiol is needed when adding cannabidiol or stiripentol to a regimen of clobazam or vice versa. Based upon our population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, we predict that an increase in N-clobazam levels, which patient data show may enhance efficacy and/or make adverse events such as somnolence more likely.

31563030	"Pharmacometrics of clobazam in pediatrics: Prediction of effective clobazam doses for Dravet syndrome
"	"To describe the use of a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model incorporating weight and ontogeny to identify effective clobazam (CLB) dosing for use in a clinical trial in pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome. Pharmacokinetic data were combined from 3 CLB trials (OV-1012, OV-1017, and study 301) and a simulated study (study 401) for a total of 1306 CLB and 1305 N-desmethyl clobazam (N-CLB) samples from 193 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients and healthy subjects aged 6 months to 45 years. A structured approach based on US Food and Drug Administration guidance and pharmacometric knowledge discovery was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effects approach. Graphing and fitting using logistical weight regression were used to identify covariates for inclusion in the final model, which was evaluated using goodness-of-fit criteria and validated using prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC). Using the final PopPK model, a simulation study determined CLB and N-CLB distributions after 4 weeks of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg CLB. The parameters of the final PopPK model were similar to previous reports. Fixed-effect parameters were precisely estimated, with no significant increase in NONMEM objective function value. Intersubject variability estimates were similar to previous reports, with <35% shrinkage associated with parameter variability, except for intercompartmental clearance and apparent volumes of distribution of peripheral compartments. Goodness-of-fit plots and pcVPC show that the model adequately described CLB and N-CLB data. The CLB/N-CLB ratio in virtual study subjects aged <3 years was 0.23 for 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg and was 0.14 for subjects aged ≥3 years, which is 2 to 3 times those reported in a previous stiripentol/CLB/valproate study in which seizure improvement was reported. The PopPK model dosing parameters of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg are likely to result in efficacious concentrations of CLB and N-CLB in pediatric patients as young as 16 months. Dosages exceeding 1.5 mg/kg should be monitored for tolerability, particularly in patients aged <2 years, as there may be a higher incidence of sedation.

"	"To assess long-term efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in children with epilepsy and a broad spectrum of underlying epileptic etiologies. Patients with epilepsy treated with rufinamide between 1/1/2009 and 1/1/2018 at Seattle Children's Hospital were included. Data were collected via retrospective chart review. Rufinamide efficacy was defined as seizure reduction from baseline including seizure free, >50% reduction, any reduction, no reduction, or worsening seizures. Pearson's chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. 183 patients (70 females and 113 males) with a broad spectrum of epileptic aetiologies (genetic/metabolic, hypoxic-ischemic, structural and others) were included. 45.9% of the patients had Lennox Gastaut syndrome. Rate of any seizure reduction was at 47.5%, seizure reduction >50% at 35%, and seizure free at 3.3%. Mean rufinamide dosage was 33.9 mg/kg/d (SD = 14.12). Mean duration of treatment was 44.48 months (SD 32.33). Suspected adverse effects occurred at 10.9%, most often as fatigue. Rufinamide achieved better seizure reduction in girls compared to boys [OR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.28, 0.97), p = 0.038]. Seizures were activated in a patient with a SCN1A mutation, fully controlled in a patient with a SCN8A mutation. Patients with certain genetic abnormalities such as DEPDC5, KCNQ2, SPATA5, and 47XYY achieved significant seizure reduction. Rufinamide is an effective and well-tolerated drug for long-term treatment in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. Certain genotypes such as SCN8A showed good response to rufinamide. Girls seemed to respond better than boys.

31625159	"Coadministered cannabidiol and clobazam: Preclinical evidence for both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions.
"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat intractable childhood epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, the intrinsic anticonvulsant activity of CBD has been questioned due to a pharmacokinetic interaction between CBD and a first-line medication, clobazam. This recognized interaction has led to speculation that the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD may simply reflect CBD augmenting clobazam exposure. The present study aimed to address the nature of the interaction between CBD and clobazam. We examined whether CBD inhibits human CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), respectively, and performed studies assessing the effects of CBD on brain and plasma pharmacokinetics of clobazam in mice. We then used the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome to examine how CBD and clobazam interact. We compared anticonvulsant effects of CBD-clobazam combination therapy to monotherapy against thermally-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and mortality in Scn1a+/- mice. In addition, we used Xenopus oocytes expressing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors to investigate the activity of GABAA receptors when treated with CBD and clobazam together. CBD potently inhibited CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of clobazam and CYP2C19 mediated metabolism of N-CLB. Combination CBD-clobazam treatment resulted in greater anticonvulsant efficacy in Scn1a+/- mice, but only when an anticonvulsant dose of CBD was used. It is important to note that a sub-anticonvulsant dose of CBD did not promote greater anticonvulsant effects despite increasing plasma clobazam concentrations. In addition, we delineated a novel pharmacodynamic mechanism where CBD and clobazam together enhanced inhibitory GABAA receptor activation. Our study highlights the involvement of both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between CBD and clobazam that may contribute to its efficacy in Dravet syndrome.

"	"ARFGEF1 encodes a guanine exchange factor involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, and is a candidate gene for childhood genetic epilepsies. To model ARFGEF1 haploinsufficiency observed in a recent Lennox Gastaut Syndrome patient, we studied a frameshift mutation (Arfgef1fs) in mice. Arfgef1fs/+ pups exhibit signs of developmental delay, and Arfgef1fs/+ adults have a significantly decreased threshold to induced seizures but do not experience spontaneous seizures. Histologically, the Arfgef1fs/+ brain exhibits a disruption in the apical lining of the dentate gyrus and altered spine morphology of deep layer neurons. In primary hippocampal neuron culture, dendritic surface and synaptic but not total GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are reduced in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons with an accompanying decrease in the number of GABAAR-containing recycling endosomes in cell body. Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in the number of GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body. Together, the altered endosome composition and decreased neuronal surface GABAAR results suggests a mechanism whereby impaired neuronal inhibition leads to seizure susceptibility.

"	"It is estimated that about 70 million people all over the world suffer from epilepsy, half of which are children, in whom the prevalence is around 0.5 to 0.8%. Although there are several therapies, the treatment of epilepsy is based mainly on drugs, which, depending on the year of coming onto the market are classified as first, second, or third generation. In this article, a description is presented on the main characteristics of the latest generation of anti-epileptic drugs (lacosamide, eslicarbazepine acetate, brivaracetam, perampanel, retigabine, everolimus and cannabidiol). These, with the exception of retigabine (is not yet on the market), are considered safe and effective in the paediatric population. Everolimus and cannabidiol have very specific indications (tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome, and Lennox Gastaut syndrome), while the rest are indicated in the management of seizures of focal origin in children from 4 years-old. These new molecules have been developed in order to provide a pharmaceutical profile and tolerance superior to the previously available drugs, and it is forecast that as their use increases, their true potential and profile will widen. Furthermore, for the first time in Paediatric Epileptology, the extrapolation of the efficacy data in adults have been used (together with specific safety and pharmacokinetic studies in the paediatric population), in order to speed up their approval for use in the child population.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) denotes a refractory epileptic encephalopathy of childhood onset with the triad of generalized slow spike-wave (GSSW) on interictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), multiple seizure types, and intellectual impairment. The neurobiology of LGS is said to sustain abnormal patterns of brain activity and connectivity that ultimately impair normal cerebral developmental mechanisms. However, we describe eight patients from our combined practice who presented with electroclinical findings consistent with LGS but without significant cognitive impairment. All patients fulfilled the other criteria of LGS with multiple seizure types (three or more of generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, myoclonic, and atypical absence) and GSSW activity on EEG. Four subjects completed high school, two completed some college, two acquired college degrees, and all performed basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) independently. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in all patients. We speculate that a variation of the classic phenotype of LGS can present with preserved cognitive and functional status, often with onset in the second decade of life, and associated with normal brain imaging.

"	"Aim:  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of childhood-onset epilepsy with multiple types of seizures, specific discharges on electroencephalography, and intellectual disability. However, LGS-related genes are largely unknown. To identify causative genes related to LGS, we collected and analyzed data from a three-generation Korean family in which one member had LGS and two had intellectual disability.  Methods:  Genomic DNAs were extracted from blood samples of all participants and used in whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic variants were detected by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was evaluated by prediction programs and the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. The LGS patient had generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges, multiple types of seizures, and developmental delay.  Results:  Analyses of the WES data from the family revealed a novel variant (c.1048G>A, p.Ala350Thr) in the IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2). This variant is within a highly evolutionarily conserved IQ-like motif, indicating a decrease in the calmodulin-binding capacity or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid transmission. The hemizygous variant in the male with LGS was a maternally inherited X-linked variant from the heterozygous maternal grandmother and mother, both of whom had intellectual disability.  Conclusion:  These findings indicate that the variant of IQSEC2 triggered both LGS and intellectual disability dependent on sex in this family. We report a novel X-linked inherited IQSEC2 variant for LGS and intellectual disability, which enhances the spectrum of variants in the IQ-like motif of IQSEC2.

"	"Since the federal ban on hemp products was lifted in December 2018, cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid derived from hemp, has become increasingly popular and accessible. CBD is sold in the form of oils, tablets, and foods in locations including gas stations, cafés, and drug stores. Despite a lack of reliable evidence, many parents praise its purported therapeutic effects on a variety of childhood ailments. Epidiolex was the first CBD-based medication to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, known as Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome, in patients of at least 2 years of age. Its efficacy was assessed through three randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled trials in a sample of 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Despite this development, there are few or no large-scale, rigorous studies concerning the effects of CBD on any other pediatric conditions that parents have tried to alleviate with CBD. The purpose of this review is to explore recent literature regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD in treating various health conditions in children; the risks of consuming CBD products, and the role of pediatricians in helping parents navigate often-confusing information about CBD. Although CBD use has dramatically increased in recent years, both its potential to treat conditions and its risks have not yet been subjected to rigorous study. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks posed by poor-quality standards and labeling practices for cannabinoid products. Due to the confusing nature of the numerous sources of information about CBD, pediatricians are in a position to provide and clarify information about CBD to parents and understand the risks it poses to children.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe subtype of childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy with drug-resistant and poor surgical prognosis. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes with structural brain lesions including focal abnormalities or asymmetric slow-spike-wave (SSW) patterns remain largely unknown. Due to the contradictory lateralization difference between MRI lesions and EEG pattern in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes, it is difficult to determine the precise lateralization of epileptic lesions, which is crucial to better surgical prognosis. This study is aim to ascertain the clinical characteristics of the EEG patterns, and its relationship with MRI lesions and to evaluate its prognostic value of surgical treatment in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Twenty-four symptomatic LGS cases with asymmetric EEG SSW patterns and contralaterally independent or contralaterally dominant MRI lesions were collected, and their clinical features were analyzed retrospectively. In this cohort, most of lesions were perinatal or acquired during the first 6 months of life. The most common etiology was intracerebral hemorrhage. The LGS patients with both asymmetric SSW and focal sporadic epileptic waves (SEW) patterns showed the best surgical outcome with Engel class I level. Asymmetric SSW patterns with maximal discharges contralateral to MRI lesions were frequently observed in most of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Predominantly diffuse destructive lesions led to an attenuated voltage of ipsilateral scalp EEG producing an asymmetric SSW pattern in those patients with symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Our study reveals a special SEW EEG pattern in symptomatic LG patients with asymmetric SSW and MRI lesions contralateral to the dominant EEG patterns. Contradictory lateralization difference between MRI and EEG probably arises from the relative voltage attenuation presenting in EEG ipsilateral to huge destructive lesions from early life. Our study suggests that the independent focal SEW activity remaining ipsilateral to the MRI lesion can potentially predict better surgical prognosis in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes.

"	"Heterozygous mutations in the STXBP1 gene encoding the presynaptic protein MUNC18-1 cause STXBP1 encephalopathy, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Impaired mutant protein stability leading to reduced synaptic transmission is considered the main underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Here, we report the first two cases carrying a homozygous STXBP1 mutation, where their heterozygous siblings and mother are asymptomatic. Both cases were diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In Munc18-1 null mouse neurons, protein stability of the disease variant (L446F) is less dramatically affected than previously observed for heterozygous disease mutants. Neurons expressing Munc18L446F showed minor changes in morphology and synapse density. However, patch clamp recordings demonstrated that L446F causes a 2-fold increase in evoked synaptic transmission. Conversely, paired pulse plasticity was reduced and recovery after stimulus trains also. Spontaneous release frequency and amplitude, the readily releasable vesicle pool and the kinetics of short-term plasticity were all normal. Hence, the homozygous L446F mutation causes a gain-of-function phenotype regarding release probability and synaptic transmission while having less impact on protein levels than previously reported (heterozygous) mutations. These data show that STXBP1 mutations produce divergent cellular effects, resulting in different clinical features, while sharing the overarching encephalopathic phenotype (developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy).

We evaluated at 3-month intervals 62 with pure LGS and 9 with LGS-like epileptic encephalopathy (28 females, 43 males, mean age 40.1 ± 11.5 yrs, median 38, range 20-71) in whom PER was introduced by 2 mg steps at 2- to 4-week intervals up to 6 mg/day, with possible dose reduction or increases after that. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were followed. Mean PER exposure was 538.9 days ± 425 (median 429), with 44 patients (62 %) on PER at last follow-up. About 2/3 of patients were responders, including 35.2 % that had a ≥75 % decrease in their seizures. Among these 16.9 % had a ≥90 % decrease. No improvement was seen in 14 patients; 5 had a less than 50 % response, and 6 had seizure aggravation. Therefore, 25 (35.2 %) were considered non-responders. Half of the patients developed at least one side-effect. Significant negative changes in behavior were noted in 1/3 of the cases, including irritability (8.5 %) and aggressivity (7 %). Contrastingly, 4 patients reported positive behavioral and psychological well-being side-effects. This retrospective, open-label study provides evidence that PER may significantly help in LGS. PER should be tried in LGS patients who are not satisfactorily controlled. Its use may be limited in some patients due to behavioral side-effects occurring, particularly at doses ≥ 6 mg/d.

In the past two decades, there has been increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based treatments for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, and there is now evidence for the medical use of cannabis and its effectiveness for a wide range of diseases. Cannabinoid treatments for pain and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (Nabiximols) have been approved in several countries. Cannabidiol (CBD), in contrast to tetra-hydro-cannabidiol (THC), is not a controlled substance in the European Union, and over the years there has been increasing use of CBD-enriched extracts and pure CBD for seizure disorders, particularly in children. No analytical controls are mandatory for CBD-based products and a pronounced variability in CBD concentrations in commercialized CBD oil preparations has been identified. Randomized controlled trials of plant-derived CBD for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) have provided evidence of anti-seizure effects, and in June 2018, CBD was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an add-on antiepileptic drug for patients two years of age and older with LGS or DS. Medical cannabis, with various ratios of CBD and THC and in different galenic preparations, is licensed in many European countries for several indications, and in July 2019, the European Medicines Agency also granted marketing authorisation for CBD in association with clobazam, for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS. The purpose of this article is to review the availability of cannabis-based products and cannabinoid-based medicines, together with current regulations regarding indications in Europe (as of July 2019).

According to the pattern of background activity, we divided our cohort into two groups: Group 1: normal background activity or with localized intermittent slow waves; Group 2: intermittent slow waves appearing generalized or in two or more lobes. Subjects included 22 children (Group 1: n=10; Group 2: n=12) diagnosed with ESwoH who received treatment from 2007 to 2017. The median age at onset of epileptic spasms was 5.5 months and the follow-up period lasted for 40.5 months. ACTH therapy was performed for seven patients from Group 1 and eight patients from Group 2. Only one patient from Group 2 responded to ACTH. Patients receiving effective treatments at early stages had excellent seizure outcome. Refractory cases included six patients in Group 1 and eight patients in Group 2; subsequent follow-up EEGs indicated hypsarrhythmia in one patient in Group 1 (17%) and six patients (75%) in Group 2, including one patient whose EEG pattern indicated progression to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, ACTH is ineffective for patients with epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia. The EEG may indicate possible future development of hypsarrhythmia if epileptic spasms are resistant to treatment, especially in patients with diffuse slow waves on pre-treatment EEG. The efficacy of treatment introduced at early stages from onset may predict long-term seizure outcome.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of ketogenic diet therapies (DTs) for LGS with mitochondrial dysfunction. This was a retrospective study involving 20 LGS patients with mitochondrial dysfunction who received several DTs from 2004 to 2014 at a single tertiary care center. Seizure reduction rate, cognitive function, retention rate, electroencephalography (EEG) changes, and adverse effects were examined before and after DTs. The retention rates at 1 and 2 years after initiation of DTs were 45% and 40%, respectively. After 1-year follow up, we observed seizure freedom in two patients, 75% seizure reduction in two patients, 50% reduction in three patients, and 25% reduction in one patient. After 2-year follow up, the outcomes were seizure freedom in two patients, 90% seizure reduction in one patient, 75% reduction in two patients, and 50% reduction in two patients. EEG findings improved in nine patients. Nine patients were treated with DTs for 1 year; all patients demonstrated improved cognitive status. Eight patients were treated with DTs for 2 years, of whom seven had improved cognitive status. Poor tolerability of DTs was due to poor oral intake and gastrointestinal problems. We demonstrate that, in LGS with mitochondrial dysfunction, improvement of seizures and cognitive function are not inferior to those in other patients treated with DTs. This study showed that DTs are efficacious and feasible for LGS patients with mitochondrial dysfunction and can significantly improve their prognosis.

"	"The review addresses the problem of the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Despite the presence of a vivid clinical and encephalographic picture, classical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which meets all of its diagnostic criteria, is quite rare. Many authors believe that the diagnosis of the syndrome is possible if the patient has tonic seizures and typical ictal and interictal patterns on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The diagnosis of the syndrome is considered probable if there are typical EEG patterns of wakefulness and sleep, but no tonic seizures are recorded. Diagnosis of the syndrome is complicated by its polyetiology (clinical and EEG manifestations can vary significantly), the evolution of seizure types and EEG characteristics as the patient matures, the presence of other epileptic syndromes similar to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex® in the USA; Epidyolex® in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound. The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02607891.

"	"Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative treatment for drug-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Laser interstitial thermal therapy has been increasingly used in the treatment of epilepsy. Here, we assess the safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy (SLACC) for drop attacks in LGS. We reviewed sequential cases of patients with medically intractable LGS who underwent SLACC using a two-cannula technique between November 2014 and July 2019. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the anteroposterior length of callosal ablation (contrast-enhancing lesion) and estimated disconnection (gap in tract projections on diffusion tensor imaging). Patients were followed longitudinally to assess clinical outcomes. Ten patients were included in this study. The median age was 33 (range = 11-52) years, median duration of epilepsy was 26 (range = 10-49) years, and median duration of postoperative follow-up was 19 (range = 6-40) months. In the anteroposterior direction, 53 ± 7% (mean ± SD) of the corpus callosum was ablated and 62 ± 19% of the corpus callosum was estimated to be disconnected. Six (60%) of 10 patients achieved >80% seizure reduction, two (20%) of whom became seizure-free. Eight (80%) patients had >80% reduction in drop attacks, five (50%) of whom became free of drop attacks. Three patients subsequently underwent laser posterior callosotomy with further improvement in drop attacks and/or overall seizure frequency. One patient had an asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage along the cannula tract. One patient developed significant aggression after becoming seizure-free. Seizure outcomes following SLACC were comparable to previously reported outcomes of open callosotomy, with reasonable safety profile. SLACC appears to be an effective alternative to open anterior corpus callosotomy with minimal postoperative discomfort and a short recovery period.

"	"Tongue bites frequently occur during seizures in epilepsy patients. We report two cases of cognitively impaired Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients with reactive lesions on the tongues. Case 1 was a 30-year-old man whose chief complaint was mouth pain. Local finding was a small bean-sized pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 45-year-old man whose chief complaint was bleeding from the mouth. His clinical finding was blood loss anemia. Local finding was a 20-mm-diameter pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as pyogenic granuloma. These mass lesions were believed to be reactive, caused by repetitive minor damage involving reparative fibrous tissue response. Therefore, the two cases may have involved reparative responses to mucosal injury incurred by accidental bites during epileptic seizures. Intellectual disability made medical treatment difficult and had allowed the massive lesions to form. It is necessary for cognitively impaired epilepsy patients to undergo regular dental examinations in order to get used to dental checks and to increase the number of intraoral observations in the context of close cooperation between dentists and epilepsy therapists.

"	"To evaluate the potential impact of concomitant clobazam (CLB) use on the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using meta-analytical techniques. We searched for randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion of patients who achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Four trials were included and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups, respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). CBD was associated with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.

32467926	"GABAA  receptor β3 subunit mutation D120N causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in knock-in mice
"	"The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a devastating early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, associated with severe behavioural abnormalities. Its pathophysiology, however, is largely unknown. A de novo mutation (c.G358A, p.D120N) in the human GABA type-A receptor β3 subunit gene (GABRB3) has been identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. To determine whether the mutation causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in vivo in mice and to elucidate its mechanistic effects, we generated the heterozygous Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse and found that it had frequent spontaneous atypical absence seizures, as well as less frequent tonic, myoclonic, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these seizure types had a unique and characteristic ictal EEG. In addition, knock-in mice displayed abnormal behaviours seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome including impaired learning and memory, hyperactivity, impaired social interactions and increased anxiety. This Gabrb3 mutation did not alter GABA type-A receptor trafficking or expression in knock-in mice. However, cortical neurons in thalamocortical slices from knock-in mice had reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitude and prolonged spontaneous thalamocortical oscillations. Thus, the Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse recapitulated human Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizure types and behavioural abnormalities and was caused by impaired inhibitory GABAergic signalling in the thalamocortical loop. In addition, treatment with antiepileptic drugs and cannabinoids ameliorated atypical absence seizures in knock-in mice. This congenic knock-in mouse demonstrates that a single-point mutation in a single gene can cause development of multiple types of seizures and multiple behavioural abnormalities. The knock-in mouse will be useful for further investigation of the mechanisms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome development and for the development of new antiepileptic drugs and treatments.

"	"The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy using the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record (EHR) data. We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean ± standard deviation: 6.5 ± 3.2 years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.

"	"Epilepsy is the noncommunicable and chronic central nervous system disorder characterized by frequent, unprovoked seizures, or electrical disturbances in the brain. Topiramate is used as an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of partial onset seizures, generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Topiramate, a BCS class II drug, has a relatively low bioavailability. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein and Blood Brain Barrier restricts its entry into the brain. This investigation was aimed to prepare O/W nanoemulsion delivery system of topiramate to improve its brain bioavailability. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was prepared by phase titration method. It was consisting of 2% w/w Capmul MCM C8, 32% w/w Tween 20:Carbitol (2:1) and 66% w/w water. It was characterized for globule size, viscosity, polydispersibility index, zeta potential, pH, conductivity values, transmittance and TEM. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and brain drug uptake study was carried out using wistar albino rats post intranasal and oral administration. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was having a globule size of 4.73 ± 0.52 nm. It was stable for six months. Brain uptake of topiramate post intranasal administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was significantly (P < 1.86 × 10-8) higher when it was compared with oral administration of topiramate loaded nanoemulsion. This study indicates that intranasal administration of topiramate containing nanoemulsion could be an encouraging approach for the treatment of epilepsy to minimize the dose of topiramate in direction to avoid dose related adverse events.

"	"The efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) with and without concomitant clobazam (CLB) was evaluated in stratified analyses of four large randomized controlled trials, two in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and two in Dravet syndrome. Each trial of CBD (Epidiolex® in the US; Epidyolex® in the EU; 10 and 20 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by CLB use. The treatment ratio was analyzed using negative binomial regression for changes in seizure frequency and logistic regression for the 50% responder rate, where the principle analysis combined both indications and CBD doses in a stratified meta-analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were examined for an exposure/response relationship based on CLB presence/absence. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The meta-analysis favored CBD vs. placebo regardless of CLB use. The treatment ratio (95% CI) of CBD over placebo for the average reduction in seizure frequency was 0.59 (0.52, 0.68; P < .0001) with CLB and 0.85 (0.73, 0.98; P = .0226) without CLB, and the 50% responder rate odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.51 (1.69, 3.71; P < .0001) with CLB and 2.40 (1.38, 4.16; P = .0020) without CLB. Adverse events (AEs) related to somnolence, rash, pneumonia, or aggression were more common in patients with concomitant CLB. There was a significant exposure/response relationship for CBD and its active metabolite. These results indicate CBD is efficacious with and without CLB, but do not exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect associated with the combination of agents. The safety and tolerability profile of CBD without CLB show a lower rate of certain AEs than with CLB.

"	"In January 2019, a new plant-derived purified cannabidiol preparation, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, became commercially available for patients ≥2 years old with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Among our patients who were prescribed the new cannabidiol formulation, we observed several cases of thrombocytopenia and therefore embarked on this study. We conducted a single-center systematic chart review of all pediatric patients (<21 years old) who were prescribed cannabidiol from January to August 2019. We evaluated salient features of the patients' epilepsy syndrome, age, concurrent medications, and surveillance laboratory results before and after cannabidiol initiation. Among 87 patients, nine (10%) developed thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir range = 17 000-108 000) following initiation of cannabidiol. Each of these nine children was on combination therapy of cannabidiol with valproic acid. Whereas no children on cannabidiol without valproic acid (0/57) developed thrombocytopenia, nine of 23 treated with combination valproic acid and cannabidiol developed platelets < 110 000/µL (P < .0001). We report a novel and clinically important side effect of thrombocytopenia in one-third of patients treated concurrently with cannabidiol and valproic acid. If this finding is confirmed, clinicians should perform close monitoring for thrombocytopenia when adding cannabidiol to a regimen that includes valproic acid.

"	"Head motion is a significant barrier to functional MRI (fMRI) in patients who are unable to tolerate awake scanning, including young children or those with cognitive and behavioural impairments. General anaesthesia minimises motion and ensures patient comfort, however the optimal anaesthesia regimen for fMRI in the paediatric setting is unknown. In this study, we tested the feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in 11 patients (mean age = 9.8 years) with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with intellectual disability. fMRI was acquired during clinically-indicated MRI sessions using a synergistic anaesthesia regimen we typically administer for epilepsy neurosurgery: combined low-dose isoflurane (≤ 0.8% end-tidal concentration) with remifentanil (≤ 0.1 mcg/kg/min). Using group-level independent component analysis, we assessed the presence of resting-state networks by spatially comparing results in the anaesthetised patients to resting-state network templates from the 'Generation R' study of 536 similarly-aged non-anaesthetised healthy children (Muetzel et al. in Hum Brain Mapp 37(12):4286-4300, 2016). Numerous resting-state networks commonly studied in non-anaesthetised healthy children were readily identifiable in the anaesthetised patients, including the default-mode, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal networks. Independent component time-courses associated with these networks showed spectral characteristics suggestive of a neuronal origin of fMRI signal fluctuations, including high dynamic range and temporal frequency power predominantly below 0.1 Hz. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of anaesthetised fMRI in children, suggesting that combined isoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia may be an effective strategy to extend the emerging clinical applications of resting-state fMRI (for example, neurosurgical planning) to the variety of patient groups who may otherwise be impractical to scan.

"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a novel therapy for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a rare, treatment-refractory epileptic encephalopathy. Two pivotal trials found CBD 20 mg/kg/day conferred a reduction from baseline in median drop seizure frequency of 44% and 42%, respectively, compared with 22% and 17%, respectively, in the usual care arms. No economic evaluations have been published to date. This analysis assessed the cost effectiveness of CBD adjunct therapy compared with usual care alone in LGS from the US payer perspective. We developed a lifetime horizon Markov decision analytic model. Efficacy, healthcare costs (2020 US$), and health state utilities were ascertained from published clinical trials, retrospective analyses, and time trade-off interviews conducted in the UK, respectively. Fifteen-year-old patients entering the model transitioned to states representing a percentage reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline, where they remained until reverting back to baseline drop seizure frequency, or death. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter uncertainty, and scenario analyses investigated the impact of various assumptions. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Compared with usual care alone, CBD yielded 0.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $314,900 additional healthcare expenditure, resulting in $451,800 per QALY. Uncertainty in health state utilities were the largest contributor to uncertainty in the results. Results from the 5000-simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance of CBD being cost effective at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, with a 95% credible range for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $325,300-$690,000 per QALY. CBD does not appear to be a cost-effective therapeutic option in LGS patients at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.

Whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA from 348 Japanese patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and their parents was conducted, and de novo variants of CACNA1G were extracted. The electrophysiological properties of each mutant channel were investigated by voltage-clamp and current-clamp analyses of HEK293T cells overexpressing these channels. Two patients diagnosed with Rett syndrome and West syndrome were found to have known pathological CACNA1G mutations reported in cerebellar ataxia cohorts: c.2881G > A, p.Ala961Thr and c.4591A > G, p.Met1531Val, respectively. One patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was revealed to harbor a previously unreported heterozygous variant: c.3817A > T, p.Ile1273Phe. Clinical symptoms of the two patients with known mutations included severe developmental delay without acquisition of the ability to walk independently. The patient with a potentially novel mutation showed developmental delay, intractable seizures, and mild cerebral atrophy on MRI, but the severity of symptoms was milder than in the former two cases. Electrophysiological study using HEK293T cells demonstrated significant changes of T-type Ca2+ currents by p.Ala961Thr and p.Met1531Val SNVs, which were likely to enhance oscillation of membrane potential at low frequencies. In contrast, p.Ile1273Phe showed no significant effects in our electrophysiological evaluations, with its pathogenesis remaining undetermined. De novo variants of CACNA1G explain some neurodevelopmental disorders. Our study further provides information to understand the genotype-phenotype correlations of patients with CACNA1G mutations.

A functional framework could facilitate understanding of their nature and severity and guide the selection instruments to measure improvements in therapeutic trials. An online survey administered through several parent-organized foundations utilized accepted functional classifications and questionnaires derived from common instruments to determine levels of mobility, fine motor, communication, and feeding functions. Statistical analyses focused on overall levels of function and across-group comparisons adjusted for age. From 6/2018 to 2/2020, 252 parents provided information for one or more functional domains. Median age was 7.2 years (interquartile range (IQR): 3.9 to 11.8), and 128 (51%) were females. DEE groups were Dravet syndrome (N = 72), KCNQ2-DEE (N = 80), KCNB1-DEE, (N = 33), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS; N = 26), electrographic status epilepticus in sleep (ESES; N = 15), and others (N = 26). Overall, functional hand grasp was absent in 48 (20%). Of children ≥2 years old, 60/214 (28%) could not walk independently, 85 (40%) were dependent on someone else for feeding, and 153 (73%) did not effectively communicate with unfamiliar people. Impairments entailing absence or near absence of independent function (profound impairment) were observed in 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 domains for 58 (25%), 78 (34%), 40 (17%), 33 (14%), and 22 (10%) children, respectively. After adjustment for age, impairment levels varied substantially across DEE group for mobility (p < 0.0001), feeding (p < 0.0001), communication (p < 0.0001), hand grasp (p < 0.0001), and number of profoundly impaired domains (p < 0.0001). Three or four profoundly affected domains were reported in 44% of KCNQ2-DEE participants, followed by LGS (29%), KCNB1-DEE (27%), ESES (7%), and Dravet syndrome (6%). Many children with DEEs experience severe functional impairments, and few children have typical function. As precision therapies will emphasize nonseizures consequences of DEEs, understanding the nature of abilities and impairments will be critical to selecting appropriate outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted of a series of patients diagnosed with WS who developed LGS seen at Hospital de Pediatría Prof. Dr. JP Garrahan between January 2012 and January 2019. The medical charts of 170 patients with WS were analyzed. In 63 (37 %) of the children WS evolved to LGS. During the transition from WS to LGS four well-defined electroclinical patterns were recognized. The first corresponded to a group of patients with multiple seizure types, including epileptic spasms associated with multifocal paroxysms; the electroclinical pattern in second group showed mainly focal seizures associated with focal discharges in the EEG; the third group showed predominance of epileptic spasms and myoclonic seizures associated with diffuse spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave paroxysms; and the remaining group was characterized by a mixed electroclinical pattern including features of the other three groups. All patients had a neuropsychological deficit. Worsening of cognition and behavior was observed during the transition period in 11, 8, and 5 patients of groups 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Our study of the transition period from WS to LGS allowed us to recognize four well-defined electroclinical patterns.

"	"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis which has recently received regulatory consideration for the treatment of intractable forms of epilepsy such as the Dravet and the Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. The mechanisms of the antiepileptic effects of CBD are unclear, but several pre-clinical studies suggest the involvement of ion channels. Therefore, we have evaluated the effects of CBD on seven major cardiac currents shaping the human ventricular action potential and on Purkinje fibers isolated from rabbit hearts to assess the in vitro cardiac safety profile of CBD. We found that CBD inhibits with comparable micromolar potencies the peak and late components of the NaV1.5 sodium current, the CaV1.2 mediated L-type calcium current, as well as all the repolarizing potassium currents examined except Kir2.1. The most sensitive channels were KV7.1 and the least sensitive were KV11.1 (hERG), which underly the slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) components, respectively, of the cardiac delayed-rectifier current. In the Purkinje fibers, CBD decreased the action potential (AP) duration more potently at half-maximal than at near complete repolarization, and slightly decreased the AP amplitude and its maximal upstroke velocity. CBD had no significant effects on the membrane resting potential except at the highest concentration tested under fast pacing rate. These data show that CBD impacts cardiac electrophysiology and suggest that caution should be exercised when prescribing CBD to carriers of cardiac channelopathies or in conjunction with other drugs known to affect heart rhythm or contractility.

32920379	"Cognitive, adaptive, and behavioral effects of adjunctive rufinamide in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A prospective observational clinical study.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe pediatric epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple drug-resistant seizure types. Children with LGS usually experience cognitive regression, and LGS is almost always associated with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Rufinamide (RFM) was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2007 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients ≥4 years of age. The primary objective of our study was to assess cognitive, adaptive, and behavior functioning of patients with LGS after 12 months of RFM therapy. This was an observational, multicenter, prospective study involving 16 patients diagnosed with LGS aged between 7 and 58 years (mean = 22 ± 16.3). Fourteen of 16 patients were already on therapy with 3 antiseizure drugs and 2/16 with 4 antiseizure drugs; RFM has been added with 100 mg/week increments up to a dose of 300-2400 mg/day. The participants and their parents underwent a neuropsychological evaluation for the assessment of intellectual, adaptive, and emotional/behavioral functioning (Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (LEITER-R), Vineland, and Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL), respectively) before the RFM introduction (baseline) and 12 months after the RFM therapy (T2). Physical and neurological examination, electroencephalography (EEG) recording, seizure type and frequency, and adverse reactions were also considered. After 12 months, the total intelligence quotient (IQ) assessed by LEITER-R did not show statistical significant changes, such as there were no statistically significant changes in adaptive functions, assessed by Vineland. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant changes in internalizing and externalizing problems assessed by CBCL. Adjunctive treatment with RFM did not negatively affect cognitive, adaptive function, and emotional profile in patients with LGS after 1 year of follow-up.

EIEE-37 is caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the FRRS1L gene, which is critical for AMPA-receptor function, resulting in intractable epilepsy and dyskinesia. A retrospective, multicenter chart review of patients sharing the same homozygous FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant identified by clinical genetic testing. Clinical information was collected regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes, neuroimaging, electrographic features and clinical response to antiseizure medications. Fifteen patients from 12 different families of Puerto Rican ancestry were homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant, with ages ranging from 1 to 25 years. The onset of seizures was from 6 to 24 months. All had hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, and most had hyperkinetic involuntary movements. Developmental regression during the first year of life was common (86%). Electroencephalogram showed hypsarrhythmia in 66% (10/15), with many older children evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Six patients demonstrated progressive volume loss and/or cerebellar atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We describe the largest cohort to date of patients with epileptic encephalopathy. We estimate that 0.76% of unaffected individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry carry this pathogenic variant due to a founder effect. Children homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) Boricua variant exhibit a very homogenous phenotype of early developmental regression and epilepsy, starting with infantile spasms and evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with hyperkinetic movement disorder.

"	"Mutations in GABRB3 have been identified in subjects with different types of epilepsy and epileptic syndromes, including West syndrome (WS), Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (MAE), and others. We herewith report on a girl affected by DS, who has been followed from infancy to the current age of 18 years. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic testing for multigene analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders identified two likely de novo pathogenic mutations, a missense variant in GABRB3 gene (c.842 C>T; p.Thr281IIe) and a nonsense variant found in BBS4 gene (c.883 C>T; p.Arg295Ter). A likely relationship between the novel GABRB3 gene variant and the clinical manifestations presented by the girl is proposed. Previously, one case of DS and two of DS-like linked with GABRB3 mutations have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DS associated with this novel variant. A literature review of clinical cases with various types of epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) related to GABRB3 mutations is reported.

"	"To assess the efficacy and safety profile of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) on clobazam and in the overall population of four randomized, controlled phase 3 trials. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD medicine (Epidiolex® in the USA; Epidyolex® in Europe; 100 mg/ml oral solution) at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, or placebo for 14 weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients on clobazam and meta-analysis by syndrome were conducted. The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in primary seizure type during the treatment period. 396 patients with LGS (49% on clobazam) and 318 patients with DS (64% on clobazam) were included. CBD treatment resulted in a reduction in primary seizure frequency vs placebo in the overall population (treatment ratio [95% confidence interval]: LGS, 0.70 [0.62-0.80]; DS, 0.71 [0.60-0.83]) and in patients receiving clobazam (LGS, 0.56 [0.47-0.67]; DS, 0.63 [0.52-0.77]). The antiseizure efficacy of CBD was also demonstrated across other endpoints vs placebo (≥50% responder rate, total seizure frequency, number of seizure-free days, and Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scores) in the overall populations and in patients receiving clobazam. There were higher incidences of somnolence and sedation in patients on CBD and clobazam. Most incidences of elevated transaminases occurred in patients on concomitant valproate and, to a lesser extent, clobazam. Add-on CBD was effective in reducing seizures in the overall populations and in conjunction with clobazam. Somnolence and sedation occurred more frequently in patients on CBD and clobazam.

"	"The observation of mild malformation of cortical development (mMCD) has yet to have a major clinical impact due to the lack of clinical and research data. We characterized the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and postoperative seizure control patterns in pediatric patients with mMCD. We examined 40 patients with isolated mMCD who underwent resective surgery during a 10-year period. The median age at seizure onset was 1.2 years, and the median age at surgery was 7.9 years. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) presented with childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy (21 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 6 West syndrome), and 13 patients (32.5%) presented with intractable focal epilepsy (10 extratemporal lesions, 3 temporal lesions). Twenty-one patients (52.5%) showed ""suspected focal cortical malformation"" on MRI, whereas 16 patients (40.0%) and 3 patients (7.5%) showed normal MRI findings or mild brain atrophy, respectively. The most common surgical procedures were two lobar resections (18 patients, 45.0%), followed by unilobar resections (12 patients, 30.0%) and resections exceeding two lobar boundaries (10 patients, 25.0%). As a final surgical outcome, 24 patients (60.0%) were ILAE Class 1-3. Discontinuation of all AEDs was possible for 36.8% of ILAE Class 1 patients. Regarding the seizure control pattern, fluctuating seizure control was observed most frequently (21 patients, 52.5%). Our results suggest that mMCD is an important pathological finding in children related to a significant degree of epileptogenicity, and resective surgery can have positive outcomes. However, these patients showed unstable postoperative seizure control patterns with a high rate of late recurrence, suggesting difficulties in the surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy.

"	"Pharmaceutically purified oral cannabidiol (CBD) has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which are severe and difficult-to-treat developmental and epileptic encephalopathies with onset in early childhood. This review will critically review the pharmacokinetic properties of CBD, the interactions with antiseizure and non-antiseizure medications, and the main tolerability and safety issues to provide guidance for its use in everyday practice. CBD is metabolized in the liver and can influence the activity of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The best characterized drug-drug interaction is between CBD and clobazam. The most common adverse events include somnolence, gastrointestinal discomfort, and increase in serum transaminases. High-grade purified CBD oral solution represents an effective therapeutic option in patients with DS and LGS. The findings cannot be extrapolated to other cannabis-based products, synthetic cannabinoids for medicinal use and non-medicinal cannabis and CBD derivatives.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is among the most severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathies. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of adjunctive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS Therapy) in patients with LGS. PubMed database was queried (January 1997 to September 2018) to identify publications reporting on the efficacy of VNS Therapy in patients with LGS, with or without safety findings. Primary endpoint of the meta-analysis was the proportion of responders (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency). Random-effects analysis was used to calculate weighted mean estimates and confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was evaluated by statistical tests including I2 . Of 2752 citations reviewed, 17 articles (480 patients) were eligible including 10 retrospective studies and seven prospective studies. A random-effects model produced a pooled proportion of 54% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 45%, 64%) of patients with LGS who responded to adjunctive VNS Therapy (p for heterogeneity <0.001, I2 =72.9%). Per an exploratory analysis, the calculated incidence of serious adverse events associated with VNS Therapy was 9% (95% CI: 5%, 14%); the rate was higher than in long-term efficacy studies of heterogeneous cohorts with drug-resistant epilepsy and likely attributed to variable definitions of serious adverse events across studies. The meta-analysis of 480 patients with LGS suggests that 54% of patients responded to adjunctive VNS Therapy and that the treatment option was safe and well-tolerated. The response in patients with LGS was comparable to heterogeneous drug-resistant epilepsy populations. A clinical and surgical overview has been included to facilitate the use of VNS in LGS.

"	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder frequently associated with epilepsy and epilepsy is a leading cause of death in ASD patients. Despite growing interest in genetic, neurophysiological and clinical overlaps, data on ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in ASD are lacking since behavioral disorders often make it difficult to obtain EEG recordings. We examined ictal EEG features in a consecutive series of patients with ASD and epilepsy. We retrospectively identified 400 consecutive patients with ASD and epilepsy at our Level 4 Epilepsy center between 2015 and 2019; 45 had at least one EEG-recorded seizure captured. Demographics, age of nonfebrile seizure onset, age of ASD diagnosis, language, magnetic resonance imagining findings, genetic testing and EEG studies were reviewed. Seizures were classified by semiologic and electrographic features. Ictal findings were analyzed. A total of 497 seizures were captured in 45 patients: 20 patients with focal onset epilepsy had 126 seizures (median: 1, range: 1-30), 17 patients with generalized onset epilepsy had 88 seizures (median: 2, range: 1-15), 7 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome had 270 seizures (median: 12, range: 1-74) and one patient had both right hemisphere focal and generalized onsets (12 focal, 1 generalized). Our study is the first to analyze a large set of ictal data in patients with autism spectrum disorder, a population traditionally difficult to obtain ictal recordings. Our results confirm the diverse spectrum of seizure types and provide clinical-EEG correlates of seizures in ASD patients. Both focal-onset and generalized-onset seizures were recorded, confirming that ASD patients have higher rates of both focal and generalized epilepsy syndromes. Among patients with focal epilepsy, temporal and frontal onsets were frequent, suggesting the possibility of epilepsy surgery or brain stimulation. EEG to classify seizures and epilepsies is critical to determine therapeutic options and effort should be made to obtain EEGs in this heterogenous population.

"	"Rufinamide is a triazole derivative that is structurally dissimilar to other marketed antiepileptic drugs, has been assumed a marketing authorization, by the European Union and FDA, for use as a complementary therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This work is concerned with development of two methods for determination of rufinamide (RUF) in presence of 1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4 carboxylic acid as its alkaline degradation product in dosage form. The first method was capable of determing RUF in the presence of its alkaline degradation product and in dosage form. Kromasil C8 column and mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v) were used and UV detection at 210 nm. In the second method, first derivative ratio spectrophotometry, RUF was determined by measuring peak amplitude at 269.5 nm over 5-30 μg/mL. The linearity range of RUF was 10-90 μg/mL for HPLC method covering its therapeutic range with r2 = 0.9999. Forced degradation under alkaline conditions was carried out, the degradation product was isolated and its structure was confirmed. Both methods were validated in accordance to ICH guidelines. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between obtained results and reported ones. The present study is useful for therapeutic drug monitoring and routine analysis of RUF in quality control laboratories. Kinetics of the alkaline degradation of RUF was studied by following the concentration of the remaining drug until complete degradation was achieved.

Due to its unique chemical design and selective binding to the alpha-2 GABA-receptor, CLB has a decreased tendency for sedation compared to other benzodiazepines. A recent literature review shows that sedation, hypersalivation (drooling), and behavior changes are the most common side effects of CLB. It has also been shown that a patient's level of consciousness is indirectly related to the risk of aspiration. Hypersalivation is too is a significant predisposing factor for aspiration. In this report, we present three adult patients with epilepsy who had aspiration pneumonia during treatment with CLB. We would like to raise awareness of increased drooling and somnolence in patients with predisposing factors for aspiration such as treatment with CLB and emphasize vigilance in this regard.

"	"This retrospective study examined patients with probable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) identified from German healthcare data. This 10-year study (2007-2016) assessed healthcare insurance claims information from the Vilua Healthcare research database. A selection algorithm considering diagnoses and drug prescriptions identified patients with probable LGS. To increase the sensitivity of the identification algorithm, two populations were defined: all patients with probable LGS (broadly defined) and only those with a documented epilepsy diagnosis before 6 years of age (narrowly defined). This specific criterion was used as LGS typically has a peak seizure onset between age 3 and 5 years. Primary analyses were prevalence and demographics; secondary analyses included healthcare costs, hospitalization rate and length of stay (LOS), medication use, and mortality. In the final year of the study, 545 patients with broadly defined probable LGS (mean [range] age: 31.4 [2-89] years; male: 53%) were identified. Using the narrowly defined probable LGS definition, the number of patients was reduced to 102 (mean [range] age: 7.4 [2-14] years; male: 52%). Prevalence of broadly defined and narrowly defined probable LGS was 39.2 and 6.5 per 100,000 people. During the 10-year study, 208 patients with narrowly defined probable LGS were identified and followed up for 1379 patient-years. The mean annual cost of healthcare was €22,787 per patient-year (PPY); greatest costs were attributable to inpatient care (33%), home nursing care (13%), and medication (10%). Mean annual healthcare costs were significantly greater for those with prescribed rescue medication (45% of patient-years) versus those without (€33,872 vs. €13,785 PPY, p < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) annual hospitalization rate was 1.6 (2.0) PPY with mean (SD) annual LOS of 22.7 (46.0) days. Annual hospitalization rate was significantly greater in those who were prescribed rescue medication versus those who were not (2.2 [2.3] vs. 1.1 [1.6] PPY, p < 0.001). The mean (SD) number of different medications prescribed was 11.3 (7.3) PPY and 33.8 (17.0) over the entire observable time per patient (OET); antiepileptic drugs only accounted for 2.1 (1.1) of the medications prescribed PPY and 3.8 (2.0) OET. Over the 10-year study period, mortality in patients with narrowly defined probable LGS was significantly higher than the matched control population (six events [2.88%] vs. oneevent [0.01%], p < 0.001). Annual healthcare costs incurred by patients with probable LGS in Germany were substantial, and mostly attributable to inpatient care, home nursing care, and medication. Patients prescribed with rescue medication incurred significantly greater costs than those who were not. Patients with narrowly defined probable LGS had a higher mortality rate versus control populations.

"	"Refractory epilepsy is a chronic brain network disorder characterized by unresponsiveness to multiple (>2) anti-epileptic drugs. Cannabidiol, a non-psychotropic neuroactive substance, is an emerging anti-epileptic treatment that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, especially Lennox Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Here, we evaluated associations between global brain network dynamics and related changes and responsiveness to cannabidiol therapy using a combination of electroencephalography phase coherence and graph theoretical analyses. Refractory epilepsy patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome underwent serial electroencephalography testing prior to and during cannabidiol treatment. Patients showing greater than 70% seizure frequency reduction were classified as treatment responders for the purposes of this study. We calculated inter-electrode electroencephalography phase coherence in delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands. Graph theoretical analysis of brain network dynamics was extracted from phase coherence to evaluate measures of network integration (i.e. characteristic path length, global efficiency and degree) and segregation (i.e. modularity and transitivity). We found that responders, relative to non-responders, showed increased network integration-as indexed by relatively higher global efficiency and lower degree-and increased network segregation-as indexed by relatively higher modularity-exclusively in the beta-frequency band. We also found that larger cannabidiol dosages were associated with increased network integration-as indexed by higher global efficiency with increasing dose-and increased network segregation-as indexed by lower transitivity with increasing dose-in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. In summary, we demonstrate novel effects of cannabidiol on brain network dynamics with important implications for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and, possibly, across broader research applications in the future.

"	"SETBP1 mutations are associated with the Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), characterized by profound neurodevelopmental delay, typical facial features, and multiple congenital malformations (OMIM 269150). Refractory epilepsy is a common feature of SGS. Loss of function mutations have been typically associated with a distinct and milder phenotype characterized by intellectual disability and expressive speech impairment. Here we report three variants of SETBP1, two novel de novo truncating mutations, identified by NGS analysis of an Intellectual Disability gene panel in 600 subjects with non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders, and one missense identified by a developmental epilepsy gene panel tested in 56 pediatric epileptic cases. The three individuals carrying the identified SETBP1 variants presented mild to severe developmental delay and lacked the cardinal features of classical SGS. One of these subjects, carrying the c.1765C>T (p.Arg589_) mutation, had mild Intellectual Disability with speech delay; the second one carrying the c.2199\_2203del (p.Glu734Alafs19_) mutation had generalized epilepsy, responsive to treatment, and moderate Intellectual Disability; the third patient showed a severe cognitive defects and had a history of drug resistant epilepsy with West syndrome evolved into a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This latter subject carries the missense c.2572G>A (p.Glu858Lys) variant, which is absent from the control population, reported as de novo in a subject with ASD, and located close to the SETBP1 hot spot for SGS-associated mutations. Our findings contribute to further characterizing the associated phenotypes and suggest inclusion of SETBP1 in the list of prioritized genes for the genetic diagnosis of overlapping phenotypes ranging from non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders to ""developmental and epileptic encephalopathy"" (DEE).

Larger case series and comparison of distinct stereotactic methods for stereotactic laser corpus callosotomy (SLCC), however, are currently lacking. The objective of this study was to report seizure outcomes in a series of adult patients with epilepsy following anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures and to compare the results achieved with a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance frames. The authors retrospectively reviewed sequential adult epilepsy surgery patients who underwent SLCC procedures at a single institution. They describe workflows, stereotactic errors, percentage disconnection, hospitalization durations, adverse events, and seizure outcomes after performing anterior, posterior, and complete SLCC procedures using a frameless stereotactic surgical robot versus direct MRI guidance platforms. Thirteen patients underwent 15 SLCC procedures. The median age at surgery was 29 years (range 20-49 years), the median duration of epilepsy was 21 years (range 9-48 years), and median postablation follow-up was 20 months (range 4-44 months). Ten patients underwent anterior SLCC with a median 73% (range 33%-80%) midsagittal length of callosum acutely ablated. Following anterior SLCC, 6 of 10 patients achieved meaningful (> 50%) reduction of target seizures. Four patients underwent posterior (completion) SLCC following prior anterior callosotomy, and 1 patient underwent complete SLCC as a single procedure; 3 of these 5 patients experienced meaningful reduction of target seizures. Overall, 8 of 10 patients in whom astatic seizures were targeted and treated by anterior and/or posterior SLCC experienced meaningful improvement. SLCC procedures with direct MRI guidance (n = 7) versus a frameless surgical robot (n = 8) yielded median radial accuracies of 1.1 mm (range 0.2-2.0 mm) versus 2.4 mm (range 0.6-6.1 mm; p = 0.0011). The most serious adverse event was a clinically significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage in a patient who underwent the robotic technique. This is the largest reported series of SLCC for epilepsy to date. SLCC provides seizure outcomes comparable to open surgery outcomes reported in the literature. Direct MRI guidance is more accurate, which has the potential to reduce the risks of SLCC. Methodological advancements and larger studies are needed.

Therefore, accurate diagnosis and treatment of LGS remain challenging. To identify causative mutations of LGS, we analyzed the whole-exome sequencing data of 17 unrelated Korean families, including patients with LGS and LGS-like epilepsy without brain abnormalities, using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. We identified 14 mutations in 14 genes as causes of LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. 64 percent of the identified genes were reported as LGS or epilepsy-related genes. Many of these variations were novel and considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Network analysis was performed to classify the identified genes into two network clusters: neuronal signal transmission or neuronal development. Additionally, knockdown of two candidate genes with insufficient evidence of neuronal functions, SLC25A39 and TBC1D8, decreased neurite outgrowth and the expression level of MAP2, a neuronal marker. These results expand the spectrum of genetic variations and may aid the diagnosis and management of individuals with LGS.

33626200	"The role of surgery in the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of childhood onset epilepsy in which patients require multiple medications and may be candidates for palliative surgical intervention. In this meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the impact of palliative vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), corpus callosotomy (CC), and resective surgery (RS) by analyzing their impact on seizure control, antiepileptic drug (AED) usage, quality of life (QOL), behavior, cognition, prognostic factors, and complications. A systematic search of PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed to find articles that met the following criteria: (1) prospective/retrospective study with original data, (2) at least one LGS surgery patient aged less than 18 years, and (3) information on seizure frequency reduction (measured as percentage, Engel class, or qualitative comment). Seizures were analyzed quantitatively in a meta-analysis of proportions and a random-effects model, whereas other outcomes were analyzed qualitatively. Forty studies with 892 LGS patients met the selection criteria, with 19 reporting on CC, 17 on VNS, four on RS, two on RS + CC, one on CC + VNS, and one on deep brain stimulation. CC seizure reduction rate was 74.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 64.5%-83.7%), and VNS was 54.6% (95% CI = 42.9%-66.3%), which was significantly different (p < .001). RS seizure reduction was 88.9% (95% CI = 66.1%-99.7%). Many VNS patients reported alertness improvements, and most had no major complications. VNS was most effective for atonic/tonic seizures; higher stimulation settings correlated with better outcomes. CC patients reported moderate cognitive and QOL improvements; disconnection syndrome, transient weakness, and respiratory complications were noted. Greater callosotomy extent correlated with better outcomes. AED usage most often did not change after surgery. RS showed considerable QOL improvements for patients with localized seizure foci. In the reported literature, CC appeared to be more effective than VNS for seizure reduction. VNS may provide a similar or higher level of QOL improvement with lower aggregate risk of complications. Patient selection, anatomy, and seizure type will inform decision-making.

33626436	"The efficacy and tolerability of auto-stimulation-VNS in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) of childhood. The Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) is established as a safe and effective treatment for DRE. This study assesses efficacy and tolerability of the auto-stimulation VNS models in pediatric patients with LGS. This is a retrospective chart review of a cohort of pediatric patients (Age 1-18 years old) with LGS implanted with an auto-stimulation VNS model at a single level four pediatric epilepsy center. Patient responder's rate was measured as seizure reduction over baseline and improvements in five quality-of-life measures as reported by the patients and families. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline. This cohort includes 71 consecutive children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent implantation with one of two models of the auto-stimulation VNS. The average age of the children at implantation was 20.82 months. Of those patients, 55 % of patients achieved greater than 50 % seizure reduction at six months, 67.7 % at 12 months, and 65 % at 24 months. At 12 months 11 % of the patients were completely seizure free and at 24 months 17 % were seizure free. By 24 months post implantation most of the patient families reported at least a 50 % improvement rate in one or more of the quality-of-life measures. The most commonly reported adverse events were dysphonia, paresthesia, and shortness of breath, all of which were tolerated and subsided by 24 months. This study provides evidence that VNS models with the auto-stimulation paradigm based on detection of tachycardia are well tolerated and effective in a pediatric population with LGS. Furthermore, this study shows that for this population, the auto-stimulation models of the VNS may provide additional benefits over the earlier VNS versions.

"	"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are among the most challenging of all epilepsies to manage, given the exceedingly frequent and often severe seizure types, pharmacoresistance to conventional antiseizure medications, and numerous comorbidities. During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.

"	"It is often difficult to diagnose epilepsy syndromes in resource-limited settings. This study was aimed to investigate the prospect of ascertaining the diagnosis, clinical profile, and treatment outcomes of epilepsy syndromes (ESs) among children in a resource-limited setting. This was a descriptive study done from 01/07/2009 to 15/06/2017 among children (1-17 years of age) with unprovoked seizures presenting to the pediatric neurology clinic of a university hospital in eastern Nepal. Diagnosis, classification, and treatment of seizures were based upon International League Against Epilepsy guidelines. Of 768 children with unprovoked seizures, 120 (15.6%) were diagnosed as ES. The age of onset of seizure was unique for each ES. Developmental delay and cerebral palsy were present in 47.5% and 28.3% children, respectively. Common ESs were West syndrome (WS)-26.7%, generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCSA)-21.7%, self-limited childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLCECTS)-12.5%, childhood absence epilepsy (CAE)-10.0%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)-10.0%, other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE)-5.8%, self-limited familial infantile epilepsy (SLFIE)-4.2%, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)-3.3%. Among children with known outcomes (87/120), overall response to pharmacotherapy and to monotherapy was observed in 72.4% (63/87) and 57.5% (50/87) children, respectively. All children with GTCSA, SLFIE, genetic epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+), CAE, SLCECTS, and JME responded to pharmacotherapy and they had normal computerized tomography scans of the brain. Seizures were largely pharmaco-resistant in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME)-100.0%, LGS-73.0%, WS-52.0%, and other DEEs-40%. A reasonable proportion (15.6%) of unprovoked seizures could be classified into specific ES despite limited diagnostic resources. WS was the most common ES. GTCSA, SLCECTS, CAE, and LGS were other common ESs. GTCSA, SLFIE, CAE, SLCECTS, GEFS+, and JME were largely pharmaco-responsive. PME, WS, and LGS were relatively pharmaco-resistant. Electro-clinical diagnosis of certain ES avoids the necessity of neuroimaging.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by the presence of multiple types of intractable seizures, cognitive impairment, and specific electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate the electroclinical features of patients with LGS during adulthood. We retrospectively identified the medical records of 20 patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of LGS from 3896 patients with epilepsy. Thirteen (65 %) patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 23.4 ± 7.1 (min-max; 18-43) years, and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 ± 4.5 (min-max; 1-14) years. The etiology was identified in 11 (55 %) patients. None of the patients achieved seizure freedom. The most prevalent seizure types were atypical absences in 14 (70 %) patients, tonic seizures in 13 (65 %) patients, and atonic seizures in 11 (55 %) patients. One (5 %) patient was diagnosed as having psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Mental retardation was reported in all patients and only half of them could walk independently. All patients had drug-resistant seizures and 16 (80 %) patients were on polytherapy. A vagus nerve stimulator was implanted into ten (50 %) patients and five reported 50-80 % seizure reduction. Ketogenic diet was administered to two (10 %) patients and epilepsy surgery was performed in two (10 %) patients with no significant benefit. Paying attention to all factors of seizure outcomes, cognitive impairment, and ambulatory status, all patients were dependent on caregivers for daily living abilities. LGS has life-long persistence with poor outcomes, even during adulthood.

33745195	"How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome?
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping. The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors. With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD-associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY-9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS. Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in-depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021.

33746760	"Cannabidiol in Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy: Clinical Pharmacokinetic Data From an Expanded Access Program.
"	"Background and Aim: Data on the clinical pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol (CBD) are scanty. We explored the effect of demographic and clinical variables on plasma concentrations of purified CBD in patients with Dravet (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods: The study design was an open, prospective, multicenter expanded access program (EAP). Venous blood samples were drawn from patients between 8 and 9 am, before the CBD morning dose, 12 h apart from the last evening dose, and then 2.5 h after their usual morning dose. Results: We collected 127 plasma samples (67-morning pre-dosing and 60 post-dosing) from 43 patients (24 females, 19 males), 27 with LGS and 16 with DS. Mean ± standard deviation age was 26 ± 15 years. Duration of CBD treatment averaged 4.2 ± 2.9 months at 13.2 ± 4.6 mg/kg/day. CBD median trough plasma concentration was 91 ng/ml; it doubled to 190 ng/ml 2.5 h post-dosing (p < 0.001). Cannabidiol trough plasma concentrations were linearly related to daily doses (r = 0.564, p < 0.001). Median trough CBD plasma concentration-to-weight-adjusted dose ratio (C/D) was 32% higher (p < 0.02) in plasma samples from subjects aged 18 and over than in those under 18. Sex and concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) were not associated with significant variations in CBD C/D, but caution is required due to the potential influence of confounders. Conclusion: These are the first data on CBD pharmacokinetics in children and adults with LGS or DS in a real-world setting. The most relevant finding was the higher CBD C/D in adults. In practice, reduced weight-normalized doses might be required with aging to achieve the same CBD plasma levels.

To describe the characteristics of patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation. We reviewed clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics of 32 patients with PAH carrying an ACVRL1 mutation, corresponding to 9 patients from the French PAH Network and 23 from literature analysis. These cases were compared with 370 patients from the French PAH Network (93 with a bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 [BMPR2] mutation and 277 considered as idiopathic cases without identified mutation). Distribution of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene in patients with PAH was compared with the HHT Mutation Database. At diagnosis, ACVRL1 mutation carriers were significantly younger (21.8 +/- 16.7 yr) than BMPR2 mutation carriers and noncarriers (35.7 +/- 14.9 and 47.6 +/- 16.3 yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). In seven of the nine patients from the French PAH Network, PAH diagnosis preceded manifestations of HHT. ACVRL1 mutation carriers had better hemodynamic status at diagnosis, but none responded to acute vasodilator challenge and they had shorter survival when compared with other patients with PAH despite similar use of specific therapies. ACVRL1 mutations in exon 10 were more frequently observed in patients with PAH, as compared with what was observed in the HHT Mutation Database (33.3 vs. 5%; P < 0.0001). ACVRL1 mutation carriers were characterized by a younger age at PAH diagnosis. Despite less severe initial hemodynamics and similar management, these patients had worse prognosis compared with other patients with PAH, suggesting more rapid disease progression.

Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score. Prospective, survey-based study. HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported epistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (OR 1.53, P < .001 for all). Risk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.

"	"Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, we collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.

"	"Hepatic involvement occurs in up to 74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and is characterized by a spectrum of arteriovenous malformations. Three different types of intrahepatic shunting may be present: hepatic artery to hepatic veins, hepatic artery to portal vein, and portal vein to hepatic vein. Hepatic involvement in HHT may lead to biliary ischemia, portal hypertension, or high-output cardiac failure (HOCF). Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been proposed as the only definitive curative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hepatic involvement due to HHT after OLT with respect to mortality, cardiac and hepatic status, epistaxis, and quality of life. Patients with HHT and severe hepatic vascular malformations who underwent OLT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit (LLTU) from 1993 to 2007 were followed at the LLTU and the French Reference Center for HHT. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. There were 13 patients who fulfilled the entry criteria of the study (12 women and 1 man). The mean age at the time of OLT was 51.8 years (range = 33-65 years). Indications for OLT were cardiac failure (n = 9), biliary necrosis (n = 2), both cardiac failure and biliary necrosis (n = 1), and hemobilia (n = 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 109 months (range = 1-200 months). Twelve patients (92.3%) are still alive. For the 9 patients with HOCF, the mean cardiac index decreased from 5.4 L/minute/m(2) before OLT to 3.0 L/minute/m(2) after OLT. No severe hepatic complications were observed after OLT. Nine of the surviving patients (75%) experienced dramatic improvements in epistaxis and quality of life, including an ability to undertake more physical activity. In conclusion, OLT is an important therapeutic option for patients with HHT who have severe hepatic involvement. In the reported cohort, the mortality after OLT for this indication was low.

After application of two antiplatelet drugs, the patient was scheduled for coronarography, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting. During her hospital stay, only a minor episode of epistaxis was observed. We conclude that anemization due to HTT may significantly accelerate the progress of ischemic heart disease, resulting in acute coronary syndrome.

20544620	"Myocardial infarction in a low risk patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"We describe the case of a 57 year-old woman with NSTE ACS, a history of recurrent and prolonged epistaxis, and low prior cardiovascular risk. Additional findings revealed anemia and an aneurysm in her central nervous system. During her hospital stay, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was diagnosed. After application of two antiplatelet drugs, the patient was scheduled for coronarography, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting. During her hospital stay, only a minor episode of epistaxis was observed. We conclude that anemization due to HTT may significantly accelerate the progress of ischemic heart disease, resulting in acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, coronarography preceded by routine application of two antiplatelet drugs seems not to increase the risk of hemorrhage in HHT patients complicated with myocardial infarction.

In many of the injected patients, the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment complications. Of the 58 treated patients 52 were contacted. Patient surveys were performed 1.5 to 46 months following their initial Bevacizumab treatment. Within the treatment population, five patients had sustained a septal perforation. Notably, these patients were treated early in the study period at which time the cartilaginous septum was often both injected and lasered. Subsequently, the treatment protocol was changed and the cartilaginous septum was neither lasered nor injected. After these changes were made no additional septal perforations were identified. No other adverse events were associated with intranasal Bevacizumab treatment. Bevacizumab applied as either a submucosal injection or as a topical nasal spray, with or without application of the KTP laser, is a safe treatment regimen. Still, when Bevacizumab injections are performed, the cartilaginous nasal septum should be avoided as patients may develop septal perforations.

At the present time, only very few prospective trials have been performed, and many studies are based on patients' subjective assessment of the severity of epistaxis. This prospective study measures the objective effect of laser treatment in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis. We introduce an objective measure to assess the severity of epistaxis: the bleeding time (BT). Before and after treatment, the quality of life, as measured by the patient, was assessed and compared to normative data. In 30 patients, we measured the BT before laser treatment 1.5 and 6.5 months after treatment. The Short form 36 (SF-36), a validated health questionnaire, was completed before and 6.5 months after treatment. Compared to preoperative value, BT was significantly reduced 1.5 and 6.5 months after laser treatment (p < 0.05) in both cases. No significant difference in quality of life, before and after treatment, was found. The quality of life of the HHT patients was reduced in five out of eight dimensions when compared with the Danish background population. Laser treatment reduces epistaxis in HHT patients with mild to moderate epistaxis for at least 6 months; this group of patients have reduced quality of life compared to the background population.

Despite the young age, a lot of comorbidities were present: severe dyslipidemia, ischemic right cerebellar lesion, degenerative periventricular lesions, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, uterine fibroma, fibrocystic mastitis, polyglobulia of uncertain etiology and Rendu-Osler disease. The investigation which showed the nature of the pulmonary nodule was the CT scan with intravenous contrast, which demonstrated that the nodules were in fact arterial-venous malformations as part of the Rendu-Osler disease. This case offers the opportunity to discuss about etiopathogeny, morphopathology, criteria of diagnosis and treatment principles in Rendu-Osler disease.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia and severe, recurrent epistaxis is a common clinical phenotype associated with HHT. An intranasal treatment regime of diluted Avastin™ (Bevacizumab; recombinant humanized anti-vascular epithelial growth factor immunoglobin G1) using apulsatile nasal irrigator has proven efficacious in clinical practice. However, concerns regarding the stability of Avastin™ following dilution and prolonged storage in standard containers used for drug delivery, such as polyethylene bottles, have so far prevented a more widespread clinical use. Compatibility with the preservative benzalkonium chloride was also unknown. This study aimed at determining, whether dilution, prolonged refrigerated storage and the presence of the preservative benzalkonium chloride - as required for novel Avastin™ formulations - affected the biochemical and electrochemical properties of the drug. We performed a detailed biochemical and electrochemical analysis of Avastin™, including native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isoelectric focusing. We did not detect any evidence of degeneration or aggregation following dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage or from the presence of benzalkonium chloride. All biochemical and electrochemical properties of Avastin™ after dilution and prolonged, refrigerated storage were undistinguishable from control. Our data provide important insight into the stability of Avastin™ and allow the consideration of novel Avastin™ formulations, including its use in a metered-dose nasal spray for the treatment of HHT and other applications.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by systemic vascular diseases mainly shown as arterio-visnous fistula (AVF). Here, we presented a 29-year-old woman with HHT complicated with migraine with aura (MWA) and vertigo. At the age of twelve years, she developed migraine with visual aura. At that time, migraine attacks were seen three times a year. At the age of 29 years, she also developed speech disturbance as migraine aura. At the ages of 20 and 29 years, she repeatedly suffered from positional vertigo attacks for a month. Physical examination revealed dilation of the capillary vessels at tongue, soft palate, and nasal mucosa and AVFs were located in the upper cervical cord, parietal lobe, and bilateral lungs. These clinical findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of HHT. Embolization of pulmonary AVF decreased the frequency of migraine attacks during 2-year follow-up after the embolization. The frequency of migraine in patients with HHT is higher than that of general population as well as the prevalence of vertigo. Therefore, MWA and vertigo presented in the patient with HHT suggests that there is a common pathological mechanism of dysfunction of endothelial cells and R-L shunt, among HHT, MWA, and vertigo.

"	"SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

For transfusion-dependent patients with severe epistaxis we have been performing the Young's procedure or surgical closure of the nostrils. The objective of this study was to report treatment of severe epistaxis related to HHT with the Young's procedure and assess patient outcome. Patients with severe iron or blood transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a Young's procedure in three otolaryngology HHT centers were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for postoperative epistaxis and subjective outcome. Forty-three patients underwent a Young's procedure for severe epistaxis and were observed for a mean of 34 months. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients and 30 of 36 patients (83%) experienced complete cessation of bleeding after the Young's procedure. Patients had a mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.68 g/dL after the procedure. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory score after surgery was 43.56. No patients requested a reversal of the procedure. The Young's procedure is a safe and efficacious procedure with complete cessation of epistaxis in most patients with severe epistaxis and HHT.

"	"The olfactory and gustatory functions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients have not been documented by validated tests. Disorders of the nasal/oral cavity may interfere with the olfactory and gustatory functions. Fifty-four HHT patients were investigated by smell/taste tests. HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests. HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered an uncommon complication of HHT whose impact on the survival of these patients is currently unknown. From January 1995 to December 2008, 29 hospitalized patients with definite HHT were included and followed until January 2011. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. PH was classified according to echocardiographic probability. A CT angiogram was performed in 24 of the 29 patients with HHT and AVMs were detected in 16 of them (67%): hepatic in 58%, pulmonary in 33% and spinal in 3%; 37% had both pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 21 patients. PH was considered possible in 4 (14%) and probable in 9 (31%). The mean age at diagnosis was lower in patients with PH than in patients without PH (54±16.5 years vs 73±8.8 years, p=0.002). PH was more prevalent in patients with AVMs (56 vs. 23%, p=0.036). The mean follow-up of the entire cohort was 6±4.4 years (range: 2 months-17 years), during this time 18 patients died (62%; mean age 73±8.1 years). Patients with PH died at a younger age (68±8.4 vs. 79±2.7 years, p=0.015) than those without PH. PH is a severe condition that significantly reduces survival on HHT patients. PH should be suspected in all HHT patients with dyspnea and hepatic AVMs.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.

"	"Targeted ultrasound contrast imaging has the potential to become a reliable molecular imaging tool. A better understanding of the quantitative aspects of molecular ultrasound technology could facilitate the translation of this technique to the clinic for the purposes of assessing vascular pathology and detecting individual response to treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether targeted ultrasound contrast-enhanced imaging can provide a quantitative measure of endogenous biomarkers. Endoglin, an endothelial biomarker involved in the processes of development, vascular homeostasis, and altered in diseases, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 and tumor angiogenesis, was the selected target. We used a parallel plate perfusion chamber in which endoglin-targeted (MBE), rat isotype IgG2 control and untargeted microbubbles were perfused across endoglin wild-type (Eng+/+), heterozygous (Eng+/-) and null (Eng-/-) embryonic mouse endothelial cells and their adhesion quantified. Microbubble binding was also assessed in late-gestation, isolated living transgenic Eng+/- and Eng+/+ embryos. Nonlinear contrast-specific ultrasound imaging performed at 21 MHz was used to collect contrast mean power ratios for all bubble types. Statistically significant differences in microbubble binding were found across genotypes for both in vitro (p<0.05) and embryonic studies (p<0.001); MBE binding was approximately twofold higher in Eng+/+ cells and embryos compared with their Eng+/- counterparts. These results suggest that molecular ultrasound is capable of reliably differentiating between molecular genotypes and relating receptor densities to quantifiable molecular ultrasound levels.

The genes known to be associated with HHT include ENG (HHT1), ACVRL1 (HHT2) and SMAD4 (JPHT). It has been reported that circulating CD34(+) cell subsets repair damaged vessels. To investigate whether mobilization of these cells is present in the peripheral blood (PB) of HTT patients, we analyzed CD34(+) cells, CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+) progenitor or mature endothelial cells, and CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed in 150 HTT patients and 43 healthy subjects (CTRLs). In HTT patients, PB CD34(+) cells were significantly increased; the frequency of endothelial cells was higher (P = 0.002), while the frequency of CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR-2(-) HPCs was lower (P = 0.00007) than in CTRLs. Results were comparable in patients with ENG or ACVRL1 gene mutation; in patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of the cell subsets inversely correlated with the age of the patients at time of sampling (CD34(+)), disease duration (CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+)), and age at disease onset (CD34(+)CD133(+) VEGFR-2(-)). In conclusion, HHT patients show an increase of circulating endothelial cells and a decrease of HPCs. In patients with ENG mutation, the frequency of CD34(+) endothelial cells correlates with specific clinical characteristics suggesting that their active turnover characterizes the initial phase of the disease.

We aimed to report the radiologic features (phenotype) and the genotype-phenotype correlations of brain vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Demographic, clinical, genotypic, and imaging information of 75 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with brain arteriovenous malformations enrolled in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium from 2010 to 2012 were reviewed. Nonshunting, small, superficially located conglomerates of enhancing vessels without enlarged feeding arteries or draining veins called ""capillary vascular malformations"" were the most commonly observed lesion (46 of 75 patients; 61%), followed by shunting ""nidus-type"" brain AVMs that were typically located superficially with a low Spetzler-Martin Grade and a small size (32 of 75 patients; 43%). Direct high-flow fistulous arteriovenous shunts were present in 9 patients (12%). Other types of vascular malformations (dural AVF and developmental venous anomalies) were present in 1 patient each. Multiplicity of vascular malformations was seen in 33 cases (44%). No statistically significant correlation was observed between hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia gene mutation and lesion type or lesion multiplicity. Depending on their imaging features, brain vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can be subdivided into brain AVF, nidus-type AVM, and capillary vascular malformations, with the latter being the most common phenotype in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

"	"Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.

Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway. We discuss the importance of founder mutations and present a thorough evaluation of missense and splice-site variants.

26171128	"Anomalies of Pulmonary Circulation as a Cause of Hemoptysis: A Series of Unusual Cases and Review of the Literature
"	"The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients. Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.

"	"Nasal closure has been shown to effectively manage severe epistaxis refractory to other treatments in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The nasal closure procedure may be underutilized because of its surgical complexity and flap breakdown. This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013. Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient. The technique is described. We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure. The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3. Comparison of 5 patients who underwent the traditional 3-flap nasal closure procedure and 8 patients receiving the 2-flap nasal closure showed no significant difference in postoperative ESS or GBI metrics. Mean operating room times of the traditional and simplified methods were 3.12 hours and 1.44 hours (p = 0.0001). Mean time to first revision for 8 nasal closure patients was 21.5 months. In short-term follow-up, the 2-flap procedure showed comparable effectiveness with significantly reduced complexity and operative time compared to the traditional nasal closure method.

26801773	"Novel homozygous BMP9 nonsense mutation causes pulmonary arterial hypertension: a case report
"	"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, fatal vascular disorder. Genetic predisposition plays vital roles in the development of PAH, with most mutations being identified in genes involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Defects in the BMP9 gene have been documented in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the most common inherited vascular disorder, which is occasionally associated with PAH. Selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR2 with BMP9 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension. We report the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic boy who was diagnosed with severe PAH and right heart failure at 3 years of age. During his stay in the pediatric intensive care unit, treatment was initiated with inhaled nitric oxide and intravenous epoprostenol; he subsequently was transitioned to treprostinil, sildenafil, and prophylactic enoxaparin. Now, two years later, the child is asymptomatic on sildenafil, bosentan, subcutaneous treprostinil, and warfarin. Genetic screening revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the BMP9 gene (c.76C > T; p.Gln26Ter). The child had no telangiectasias or arteriovenous malformations; family history also was negative. Subsequent parental testing showed both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation, indicating that the child inherited the BMP9 mutant allele from each parent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a BMP9 mutation in a patient with PAH. The homozygous nonsense mutation may account for the early onset and severity of PAH in this patient and also fit the 'two-hit' model we proposed previously. The absence of clinical symptoms for PAH in the parents may be due to incomplete penetrance or various expressivities of the BMP9 mutations. Our study expands the spectrum of phenotypes related to BMP9 mutations.

The majority of ACB schwannomas arise from the sinonasal tracts and may demonstrate intracranial extension. We report a case of an olfactory schwannoma dense adherence to the basal frontal lobe . Complete tumor resection was performed through a unilateral extended endonasal endoscopic approach with preservation of the contralateral olfactory bulb. Anterior cranial base repair was achieved with a contralateral mucoperichondrial vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap. A twenty-five-year-old female with a history of migraines presented with unilateral epistaxis and progressive worsening of her headache symptoms. The patient had a history of HHT. Nasal endoscopy showed mild telangiectasias, but no clear evidence of a mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large left-sided expansile lesion in the left ethmoid region with expansion and remodeling of the anterior cranial base mass and medial left orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed the mass to be avidly enhancing. Angiography was performed and demonstrated a mild vascular blush. We report a rare case of HTT and olfactory schwannoma completely resected with a unilateral extended endoscopic endonasal approach. Reconstruction was performed with a contralateral nasoseptal flap. This is the first reported single stage fully endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach for resection of an olfactory schwannoma with preservation of the contralateral olfactory cleft. The patient's sense of smell and taste was maintained postoperatively.

Right heart catheterization revealed a large left to right shunt due to an arteriovenous malformation in the liver. Because of additional telangiectasia of the lips the presumptive diagnosis was Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. Typical nosebleeds and other symptoms of the disease were lacking and only two out of four Curaçao criteria were positive; therefore, genetic testing was performed, which verified the clinical diagnosis. Off-label use of the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab was initiated as the therapeutic strategy and led to an improvement in the symptomatic dyspnea.

"	"An intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula(dAVF)was incidentally detected in a 39-year-old man during a medical checkup. Except for a mild episode of pneumonia at the age of 22 years, his medical history was unremarkable. He had no family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia(HHT). The dAVF was treated radically via ligation of the fistula, without any complications. Postoperative angiography demonstrated that the dAVF had completely healed, but showed an aberrant, dilatated, and tortuous internal mammary artery. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed multiple arterio-arterial fistulas between various systemic arteries and the pulmonary artery(an intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, an internal mammary artery to the pulmonary artery fistula, and an inferior phrenic artery to the pulmonary artery fistula). These thoracic lesions did not require additional treatment because they did not cause any symptoms, e.g., respiratory or cardiac failure. In most previous cases, such aberrant thoracic arterial fistulas were detected incidentally or based on the presence of minor clinical symptoms. However, in some cases, they caused severe respiratory or cardiac failure and were treated via the embolization of the responsible vessels. Therefore, the co-existence of thoracic arterial fistulas in patients with dAVF should be evaluated, even if the dAVF does not meet the criteria for HHT. Such thoracic lesions might cause a chest murmur that can be detected via a stethoscope or via a blunt costophrenic angle on chest radiography.

"	"To evaluate if injection of intravenous particles may provoke migraines in subjects with right-to-left shunts due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Migraine headaches commonly affect people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), especially those with pulmonary AVMs that provide right-to-left shunts. In our clinical practice, patients occasionally reported acute precipitation of migraine headaches following injection of technetium-labeled albumin macroaggregates for nuclear medicine scans. Self-reported migraine features and exacerbations were examined in HHT subjects with and without pulmonary AVMs, for a series of noninvasive and invasive investigations, using an unbiased online survey. One hundred and sixty-six subjects were classified as having both HHT and migraines. HHT subjects with migraines were more likely to have pulmonary AVMs (P < .0001). HHT subjects with pulmonary AVMs were more likely to report photophobia (P = .010), ""flashes of light"" (P = .011), or transient visual loss (P = .040). Pulse oximetry, x-rays, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scans without intravenous contrast medium rarely, if ever, provoked migraines, but unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported to exacerbate migraines by 14/124 (11.2%) subjects. One hundred and fourteen subjects had both enhanced and unenhanced CT examinations: studies with contrast media were more commonly reported to start (9/114 [7.8%]), and/or worsen migraines (18/114 [15.7%]), compared to those undertaken without contrast medium (P < .01), or after simple blood tests (P < .05). Additionally, migraine exacerbation was reported by 9/90 (10%) after contrast echocardiography, 2/44 (4.5%) after nuclear medicine scans, and 10/154 (6.5%) after blood tests. HHT subjects frequently report migraine exacerbation following blood tests, contrast echocardiograms, MRI imaging, and CT studies performed with intravenous contrast medium. Since air emboli are recognized to complicate intravenous injections, particularly those given by a pressurized pump during contrast enhanced CT, future studies should re-evaluate whether particulate emboli provoke migraines.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited autosomal dominant disease presenting with recurrent bleeding episodes and iron deficiency anemia due to vascular malformations. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

HHT is characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and vascular visceral dysplasia responsible for visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). to report the experience of two university hospitals (Trousseau, Paris, and CHIC, Creteil) with screening children for HHT and pulmonary AVM (PAVM) using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). parents with confirmed HHT were offered to have their children screened for the mutation identified in their family, and informed consent was obtained. Children carrying the same mutation as their parents underwent HRCT of the chest without contrast. between 2008 and 2015, 99 children were screened for HHT mutations. Mutations were identified in 59 patients, that is 24 HHT1 and 35 HHT2. Radiologic and clinical screening was possible in 52 patients (21 HHT-1 and 31 HHT-2). Among those, PAVM was identified in 13 patients (25%; n = 8 HHT1; n = 5 HHT2), and four of them required embolization therapy. This study highlights the usefulness of genetic screening in children with known HHT family. It also suggests that a non-invasive protocol such as HRTC is an efficient approach to detect non-symptomatic lesions that are present early on in children carrying the ENG (HHT1), but also the ACVRL1 mutations (HHT2).

"	"Use of reliable grading scores to measure epistaxis severity in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is essential in clinical routine and for scientific purposes. For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.

28407366	"Screening children for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Evaluation of 18 years of experience
"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with multi-systemic vascular dysplasia. Early diagnosis through screening is important to prevent serious complications. How best to screen children of affected parents for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is often subject to debate. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram (TTCE) is considered optimal in screening for PAVMs in adults. Guidelines for the screening of children are not specific, reflecting the lack of scientific evidence on the best method to use. Aims of this study are (i) to evaluate our current screening method, consisting of history, physical examination, pulse oximetry, and chest radiography and (ii) to assess whether postponing more invasive screening for PAVMs until adulthood is safe. This is a prospective observational cohort study using a patient database. Over a period of 18 years (mean follow-up 9.21 years, SD 4.72 years), 436 children from HHT families were screened consecutively. A total of 175/436 (40%) children had a diagnosis of HHT. PAVMs were detected in 39/175 (22%) children, 33/39 requiring treatment by embolotherapy. None of the screened children suffered any PAVM-associated complications with this screening method. This study shows that a conservative screening method during childhood is sufficient to detect large PAVMs and protect children with HHT for PAVM-related complications. Postponing TTCE and subsequent chest CT scanning until adulthood to detect any smaller PAVMs does not appear to be associated with major risk.

"	"The liver has a complex vascular supply, which involves the inflow of oxygenated blood through the hepatic artery (systemic circulation) and deoxygenated blood through the portal vein (portal circulation), as well as the outflow of deoxygenated blood through the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava. A spectrum of vascular variants can involve the liver. Some of these variants may result in areas of enhancement that can mimic more serious pathologic conditions. In this article, the authors discuss a spectrum of variants and pathologic conditions that may involve the liver vasculature. These include variants, anomalies, and diseases involving the portal vein, such as rudimentary portal vein, thrombosis, cavernous transformation, thrombotic angiitis, thrombophlebitis, transient hepatic attenuation difference or transient hepatic intensity difference, portal venous aneurysm, and portal vein gas. The hepatic artery can be involved by various diseases, including thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. Unusual ""third inflow"" sources of venous inflow are also discussed, including aberrant right gastric vein, aberrant left gastric vein, epigastric-paraumbilical veins, and cholecystic vein. A spectrum of variants and diseases involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, including thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease, stenosis, torsion, congestive hepatopathy, and peliosis hepatis, are discussed. Vascular shunts are illustrated, including portosystemic shunts (intra- and extrahepatic), arterioportal shunt, shunts of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and acquired arteriovenous fistula. Familiarity with the pathogenesis and imaging features of these vascular entities can aid radiologic diagnoses and guide appropriate patient management. (©)RSNA, 2017.

Little is known about pCLE imaging deep inside the small bowel, therefore the aim of this study was to determine its usefulness. Between April 2014 and January 2016, we performed 38 pCLE examinations during double-balloon enteroscopy with intravenous fluorescein in 37 patients with: tumors (n = 10), vascular disorders (n = 6), inflammatory diseases and drug injuries (n = 13), other disorders (n = 4), and normal findings (n = 4). We measured the calibers of capillary and lymphatic vessels at 15 different sites and compared the calibers between pCLE images and histopathology. We also compared pCLE findings with pathologic diagnosis. The inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology. In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %). pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.

Statistical analysis was performed with commercially available software. A total of 312 patients (41% men, 59% women; mean age, 51 ± 18 years) with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were identified. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity was present in 23.4% of patients and demonstrated a statistically significant association with older age (P < .001), increased hepatic AVMs (P < .001), high cardiac output state (P < .001), hepatic failure (P = .01), elevated peak serum alkaline phosphatase level (P = .03), and increased total bilirubin count (P = .03). There was no significant association with sex, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia genetic mutation status, parkinsonism, or serum transaminase levels. Basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity occurs in >23% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and is associated with hepatic vascular malformations, hepatic dysfunction, and elevated cardiac output. The presence of this finding on screening MR imaging in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should prompt further evaluation for visceral lesions causing arteriovenous shunting.

"	"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.

All patients treated with intravenous bevacizumab for severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related bleeding from June 1, 2013, through January 31, 2017, were included in this report. Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients. Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores (P<.001) and RBC transfusion requirements (P=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function. Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship as well as clinical, genetic, and biomarker predictors of response.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed one- and three-year survival rates of HHT-PAH patients were 77.8% and 53.3% respectively, which were worse than matched IPAH patients (log rank: P = 0.047). HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid. HHT-PAH patients may have a worse prognosis than matched IPAH patients. Baseline total bilirubin may be a promising predictor for the long-term prognosis in HHT-PAH patients.

"	"Background: Mesenchymal dysplasias or inherited connective tissue diseases are the group of diseases with deficiency of various components of connective tissue. Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton, sight organ, skin, lungs, heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage, especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels.Aim: To evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias.Study design: Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias, including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome (I group), 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (II group), and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) (III group) of the age from 18 to 36. The study included retrospective analysis (for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery, especially the risk of hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal vessel growth that results in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the skin, mucosa, and viscera. Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia. We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea. Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.

We report a prospective, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalating study [50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg], designed as a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate efficacy of pazopanib on HHT-related bleeding, and to measure safety. Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE. In conclusion, we observed an improvement in Hgb and/or epistaxis in all treated patients. This occurred at a dose much lower than typically used for oncologic indications, with no serious AE. Further studies of pazopanib efficacy are warranted.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with HHT can develop vascular dysplasias called telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.

"	"Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a curative treatment in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with severe hepatic involvement. We provide a long-term evaluation of graft status after LT for HHT, with a focus on the risk of recurrence. The present study included all patients prospectively followed up after LT for HHT in the Lyon Liver Transplant Unit from 1993 to 2010, with a survival of more than 1 year. Protocol clinical, radiological, and histological examinations were performed at regular intervals. Fourteen patients were included (13 women and one man). Median age at LT was 52.5 years (range: 33.1-66.7). In eight patients (seven female), disease recurrence was diagnosed by abnormal radiological features, suggestive of microcirculatory disturbances. Typical vascular lesions, including telangiectasia, were demonstrated by liver biopsy in five of these patients. The median interval between LT and diagnosis of recurrence was 127 months (range: 74-184). The risk of recurrence increased over time; estimated cumulative risk was 47.9% at 15 years. Liver tissue analysis found the coexistence of an angiogenic process combined with endothelial microchimerism, as shown by the presence of vascular lining cells of recipient origin. Conclusion: The present data show that disease recurrence occurs, usually after a long delay, in a significant number of patients treated by LT for liver complications of HHT. This strongly supports the necessity of a lifelong follow-up and suggests that therapeutic strategy needs discussion and evaluation, especially of the role of potential adjuvant treatments to LT, such as antiangiogenic medications, when recurrent disease appears.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.

For pulmonary arteriovenous malformations with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, bleeding risk after thrombolysis is high, while for isolate pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, bleeding risk is much lower. We here present 2 cases of ischemic stroke with isolate pulmonary arteriovenous malformations treated with thrombolysis. Right-to-left shunt was found by contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler in these 2 patients and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were confirmed by contrast-transthoracic echocardiography and thoracic computed tomography angiography.

31360828	"Topically Applied Etamsylate: A New Orphan Drug for HHT-Derived Epistaxis (Antiangiogenesis through FGF Pathway Inhibition)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a rare genetic vascular disorder, has been rarely reported in South Korea. We investigated the current prevalence and presenting patterns of genetically confirmed HHT in South Korea. We defined HHT patients as those with proven mutations on known HHT-related genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) or those fulfilling 3 or 4 of the Curaçao criteria. A computerized systematic search was performed in PubMed and KoreaMed using the following search term: (""hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia"" AND ""Korea"") OR (""Osler-Weber-Rendu"" AND ""Korea""). We also collected government health insurance data. HHT genetic testing results were collected from three tertiary hospitals in which the genetic tests were performed. We integrated patient data by analyzing each case to obtain the prevalence and presenting pattern of HHT in South Korea. We extracted 90 cases from 52 relevant articles from PubMed and KoreaMed. An additional 22 cases were identified from the three Korean tertiary hospitals after excluding seven cases that overlapped with those in the published articles. Finally, 112 HHT patients were identified (41 males and 71 females, aged 4-82 years [mean±standard deviation, 45.3±20.6 years]). The prevalence of HHT in South Korea is about 1 in 500,000, with an almost equal prevalence among men and women. Forty-nine patients underwent genetic testing, of whom 28 had HHT1 (ENG mutation) and 19 had HHT2 (ACVRL1 mutation); the other two patients were negative for ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 mutations. The prevalence of HHT is underestimated in Korea. The rate of phenotypic presentation seems to be similar to that found worldwide. Korean health insurance coverage is limited to representative genetic analysis to detect ENG and ACVRL1 mutations. Further genetic analyses to detect HHT3, HHT4, and other forms of HHT should be implemented.

Disease has progressed considerably during 2.5 years after hospital discharge despite subsequent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). One hypothesis that might explain the coexistence of hepatic hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and Budd-Chiari syndrome in this patient is ischemia and thrombosis of hepatic veins. Further studies are required to evaluate the relationship between HHHT and BCS. Our observations already challenged the TIPS therapeutic strategy in BCS secondary to HHHT patients.

Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack.

"	"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is formed by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins that bypass the pulmonary capillaries and transport deoxygenated blood through pulmonary veins to the left heart. This causes insufficient oxygenation of blood in the lungs. This condition remains symptomless for a long period of time. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, nosebleeds, increased fatigue and a gradual development of cyanosis. Paradoxical embolism in the brain is a serious complication; it can present with a stroke or a brain abscess. Treatment of the disease consists of embolization of the pathological vascular connections, surgical resection of the affected pulmonary parenchyma and management of concomitant manifestations of the disease. PAVM in most common cases arises as a result of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder referred to as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  Case report: In our communication, we document the diagnostic and therapeutic management in a young patient diagnosed with PAVM after falling off his bicycle. Based on comprehensive assessments, AV malformations with a 40% shunt of the pulmonary circulation were detected. An angiographic procedure was not an appropriate option considering the type and extent of the condition. Therefore, video-assisted thoracic resection of the affected pulmonary lobe was indicated. Conclusion: PAVM is a rare finding. PAVM should be ruled out in all patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) signs in the oral cavity. Contrast sonography of the heart and contract CT of the chest are the methods of choice for the diagnosis. Conservative or pharmacological treat-ment fails to improve the patients status.  The condition is usually managed by embolization. Cases where PAVM is rather extensive or diffuse, where endovascular management would be inappropriate, can be well managed using endoscopic resection adequate to the extent of the condition.

"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

"	"For treatment of intractable epilepsies, there are no data comparing conventional adrenocorticotropic hormone and pulsatile corticoid therapy with dexamethasone. A retrospective comparison of efficacy was therefore conducted for both forms of application. Between 1989 and 2001, a series of 11 children with West syndrome and 3 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (group 1); between 2003 and 2006, 7 children with West syndrome, 5 with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep, and 2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with pulsatile corticoid therapy (group 2). In group 1 (n = 14), 9/11 West syndrome patients became seizure free, but none with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (0/3). In group 2 (n = 14), 4/7 West syndrome patients became seizure-free, 1/2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome exhibited seizure-frequency reduction, and 2/5 patients with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep exhibited significant improvement according to electroencephalograms. In West syndrome, pulsatile corticoid therapy was an effective alternative treatment to adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in general steroids did not lead to a significant seizure reduction. In electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, treatment with pulsatile corticoid therapy seems to be effective and should be investigated in a larger group of patients.

During the early stages of the disease, all patients presented tonic seizures (TS) during wakefulness and sleep, 20/27 had atypical absences (AA), more rarely other seizure types. EEG showed slow background activity in 21/27 patients, diffuse slow spike-wave discharges (DSSW) during wakefulness in 22/27, and bursts of diffuse fast rhythms (DFR) in sleep in all patients. At last observation, 11 patients only had TS during wakefulness, but all still presented TS during sleep; AA persisted in 6 patients. EEG showed normal BA in 12/27 patients; only 7/27 still presented DSSW. On the contrary, sleep EEG showed the persistence of DFR in all. A moderate to severe cognitive impairment was observed in 26/27 patients. In adult LGS patients TS during sleep remain the major seizure type; moreover, a standard waking EEG may be normal. Thus, polysomnography represents the most important mean of investigation also in adult LGS patients.

20199521	"Adjunctive rufinamide in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a long-term, open-label extension study
"	"This open-label extension evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who had previously completed a 12-week double-blind study. In total, 124 patients (aged 4-37 years), receiving 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs, were treated with rufinamide approximately 25-60 mg/kg/day. Efficacy was assessed by seizure frequency; tolerability by adverse events (AEs) and laboratory tests. Overall, patients were treated with rufinamide for a median (range) of 432 (10-1149) days. Reductions in seizure frequency were observed throughout the study; during the last 12 months of treatment, 41.0% and 47.9% of patients had > or = 50% reduction in total and tonic-atonic seizure frequency, respectively. The most common AEs were vomiting (30.6%) and pyrexia (25.8%). In this open-label extension, rufinamide appeared to be an effective long-term adjunctive therapy for the treatment of LGS-associated seizures in children and young adults.

20345938	"Infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms: report of 19 patients
"	"Late-onset spasms (LOS) are epileptic spasms starting after the first year of life. Our aim was to assess the electroclinical features and the follow-up of the patients with this particular type of epileptic seizure. We retrospectively included all patients with LOS confirmed by electroencephalography between 1989 and 2008. Clinical and electroencephalographic findings at diagnosis and during follow-up were collected. The Vineland scale was used to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome. We report 19 patients with LOS of 240 patients with recorded epileptic spasms. Eighteen patients had an epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. The ictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed a focal or generalized discharge of triphasic slow-waves, slow-spikes, or slow spikes-waves with fast activities. The interictal EEG usually showed focal or generalized slow-waves or slow spikes-waves without hypsarhythmia. LOS were controlled in only six patients. Three developed typical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 10 had a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Neuropsychological outcome was evaluated in 15 patients with the Vineland scale. Cognitive functions were normal in only one patient, whereas severe cognitive delay was observed in 12 of 15. Epileptic spasms may appear after the age of one. They are more frequently observed in patients with epileptic encephalopathy. In few patients this type of seizure was observed before the patients fulfill Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria. In one patient, we diagnosed a focal epilepsy with seizures occurring in cluster. When LOS are related to an epileptic encephalopathy, this epileptic syndrome seems to be linked to refractory epilepsy and severe cognitive outcome unrelated to the etiology.

Epileptic syndromes were classified according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy of 1989. Prevalence of epilepsy was 8.5%. Average age was 6 years 7 months. Age of seizure onset ranged from 2 months to 14 years. Male gender predominated. Antecedents were dominated by peri- and neonatal complications. Parental consanguinity and a family history of epilepsy were found in 19.2 and 11.6% of cases, respectively. Schooling was perturbed in more than one-third of the school-age children. Generalized seizures were most common (70.5%). Association with cerebral palsy was present in 18.6% of cases, with mental retardation in 4.7%. The epilepsy was idiopathic for 41% of the children, symptomatic for 39% and cryptogenic for 20%. Generalized epileptic syndromes were the most frequent, epilepsy absence (12%), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (6%), West syndrome (5.5%) and myoclonic epilepsy (4%). The most common partial epileptic idiopathic syndrome was benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. Single-drug therapy was the rule for first intention treatment (96.8%). Sodium valproate was the antiepileptic drug most widely used (82%). Treatment led to resolution of the seizures in 76% of the children. Preventive measures should be reinforced in our context with a considerable proportion of children presenting neonatal risk factors. Efforts should be made to improve schooling for children with epilepsy.

"	"We conducted a Japanese Expert Consensus (EC) study for the treatment of childhood epilepsies following the method reported from the USA and EU (Wheless JW, et al., 2005, 2007), and compared the results to reveal differences in the choice of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The subjects were 41 pediatric board-certified epileptologists who responded to the 23 questionnaires. A 9-point scale was used to grade each AED, in which 9 was the best whereas 1 was the worst for appropriateness of choice for each epileptic syndrome. Lamotrigine (LTG) is frequently used for idiopathic generalized epilepsy except for valproate sodium (VPA) in both the USA and EU, while VPA and clonazepam were the main AEDs in Japan. For cryptogenic complex partial epilepsy and benign focal epilepsy, carbamazepine was a first-line AED among the USA, EU, and Japan, although other first-line AEDs were oxcarbamazepine (OCBZ), LTG, and levetiracetam (LEV) in both the USA and EU, while it was zonisamide in Japan. Regarding the treatment for symptomatic generalized epilepsy, West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, VPA and ACTH were first-line AEDs commonly used in the USA, EU, and Japan, while the other first-line AEDs were topiramate (TPM) and LTG in the USA and EU, and CZP and clobazam in Japan. This Japanese EC study demonstrated the difference in the selection of AEDs for epileptic syndromes between the USA and EU, which use more newly-introduced AEDs including TPM, LTG, OCBZ and LEV as first-and second-line AEDs, and Japan.

"	"The treatment of epilepsy is complicated by the multiple seizure types and epilepsy syndromes needing therapy. In addition, seizures in up to 30% of epilepsy patients are resistant to available medications. The three newest antiepileptic medications (lacosamide, rufinamide, and vigabatrin) all putatively have novel mechanisms of action, which might increase the chance of treatment success in patients failing previous antiepilepsy drug trials and the chance of successful synergy with currently available medications. In our experience, all three drugs generally are well tolerated, although the risk for serious long-term complications with vigabatrin presents special challenges and precautions. Lacosamide is approved for the adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures in adults and also is available in an intravenous formulation. Rufinamide is a new treatment option for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and although it is not FDA approved for partial seizures, it has shown efficacy for that indication as well. Vigabatrin has been approved in adults for drug-resistant complex partial seizures and in infants as a treatment option for infantile spasms.

In all patients, the etiology was unknown, but ARX and CDKL5 mutations were negative in all cases. All coding exons of STXBP1 were analyzed by direct-sequencing. Two de novo nucleotide alterations of STXBP1 were identified in two patients with Ohtahara and West syndrome, respectively. No de novo or deleterious mutations in STXBP1 were found in the remaining 84 patients with various types of symptomatic epilepsies. This is the first case report showing that STXBP1 mutations caused West syndrome from the onset of epilepsy. STXBP1 analysis should be considered as an etiology of symptomatic West syndrome without explainable cause.

Twenty-four patients were randomized into a long-term trial group, and 19 patients could successfully discontinue the diet after 2 years. Primary outcome measures included seizure relapse and frequency of 35 patients for > 12 months after successful completion of the KD. Of 16 patients in the short-term trial group, two patients relapsed with clusters of spasms, and one patient had recurrence of occasional focal seizures. Of 19 patients in the long-term trial group, two patients progressed to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and one patient experienced recurrence of occasional focal seizures with secondary generalization. An early response to the KD, evidenced by short latency before seizure freedom and disappearance of hypsarrythmia and cryptogenic etiology, may indicate a successful early discontinuation of the KD. Significant growth failure was complicated only in conventional long-term trial group. Use of the KD for only 8 months in children who become spasm-free appears to be justified, with similar outcomes, recurrence rate, and less growth disturbance than a longer-term, traditional use.

VPA has been linked to serious hepatotoxicity. We report a 22-year-old liver transplanted patient with LGS successfully treated with VPA in combination with phenobarbital (100 mg/d; blood level: 36 mg/l), lamotrigine (125 mg/d; blood level: 4.81 mg/l) and topiramtate (175 mg/d), as well as immunosuppressive, antiviral, anti-anemic, hypo-phosphoric and alkaline medication. On VPA 1000 mg/d, the seizure frequency decreased significantly. Taking into consideration the patient's good tolerance and the normal liver function, VPA was increased to 1500 mg/d. At this dose the daily drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures totally ceased. The patient presented only some tonic seizures around awakening. During many years, VPA was avoided in this patient because of its potential hepatotoxicity. However the good functioning of the transplanted liver permitted its introduction. VPA can be used safely in liver transplanted patients under the strict control of the hepatic function.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy with a peak age of onset of 3-5 years of age. Reported prevalence rates for LGS vary widely from 1-10% of all childhood epilepsies. Incidence rates are much lower. LGS is characterized by intractable, multiple, generalized seizure types and an interictal electroencephalogram showing bursts of slow spike-and-wave, paroxysmal bursts of generalized polyspikes, and a slow background. All patients have tonic seizures during sleep that may be subtle, and nearly all have treatment-resistant, lifelong epilepsy. Cognitive stagnation and behavioral problems are seen in almost all patients and lead to a life of dependency. The differential diagnosis includes other symptomatic generalized epilepsies and pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Misdiagnosis is common. Children and adults with LGS have an enormous impact on their families, and efforts to improve the quality of life for these patients are complex.

We have studied the efficacy of VNS in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy hospitalized in the Neurology Department of the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. From 1997 to 2001 we have implanted VNS in 11 patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, who were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) negative and from May 2007 to May 2009 in 11 patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, 9 of them were MRI positive, and were inoperable due to localisation of the pathomorphologic changes (ganglioglioma, hamartoma, various types of cortical dysplasia, porencephalic cysts), 2 were MR negative. In the group of MRI negative patients 1 patient had complex partial seizures (CPS), 6 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation, 2 patients had primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) including myoclonic, absence, atonic and tonic-clonic seizures, one patient had PGE and CPS, and 3 patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). In the group of MRI positive patients one patient had elementary partial seizures (EPS) and CPS, two patients had EPS and CPS with secondary generalisation, one patient had CPS, 3 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation, and 2 patients had CPS with secondary generalisation as well as atonic seizures. After continuous follow-up of 11 MRI negative patients during 5 years and 2 MRI negative patients during one year there was decrease in mean-seizure frequency of 51.67%. After continuous follow-up of 9 MRI positive patients during 2 years there was decrease in mean-seizure frequency of 61.9%. The most frequent side effects were hoarseness, throat pain and cough in the ""on phase"" of the VNS, but they were mild and transitory. We can conclude that VNS was effective mode of therapy in our group of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.

"	"We aimed to clarify the relationships between post-sectional recruitment of epileptiform discharges (PRED) seen in electrocorticograms (ECoG) during callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and postoperative seizure outcome. We retrospectively analyzed ECoG obtained during subtotal callosotomy (6 cm) in 48 patients with LGS (32 males, 16 females; age range, 1-20 years; mean age, 7.6 years) from July 1993 to November 1996 and compared recorded findings with postoperative seizure outcome. At analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 10 years. Of 48 patients, 15 (31.3%) had PRED in their post-section ECoG. Of these patients, 11 (73%) achieved significant (at least 50%) overall seizure reduction postoperatively. The phenomenon of PRED in callosotomy did not predict a better postoperative seizure outcome (p>0.05).

"	"We aimed to clarify the relationships between post-sectional recruitment of epileptiform discharges (PRED) seen in electrocorticograms (ECoG) during callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and postoperative seizure outcome. We retrospectively analyzed ECoG obtained during subtotal callosotomy (6 cm) in 48 patients with LGS (32 males, 16 females; age range, 1-20 years; mean age, 7.6 years) from July 1993 to November 1996 and compared recorded findings with postoperative seizure outcome. At analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 10 years. Of 48 patients, 15 (31.3%) had PRED in their post-section ECoG. Of these patients, 11 (73%) achieved significant (at least 50%) overall seizure reduction postoperatively. The phenomenon of PRED in callosotomy did not predict a better postoperative seizure outcome (p>0.05). We concluded that post-sectional ECoG recruitment of electrical discharges during callosotomy did not predict postoperative prognosis. However, this finding should be supported and elucidated by further studies. The heterogenous ECoG findings during callosotomy in our series might suggest a complicated role of the corpus callosum in the epileptogenesis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Atypical absence seizures are drug resistant in the majority of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and herald a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we studied the effects of environmental enrichment, enriched housing conditions designed to stimulate sensory and motor systems in the brain, on behavioral outcome in mice treated with the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor AY-9944 (AY), a clinically relevant model of atypical absence epilepsy. Beginning at postnatal day (P) 2, C3H mice were treated with AY (7.5 mg/kg) every 6 days until P20 and then weaned into enriched or standard cages. After 30 days (∼P50), AY mice from the enriched housing condition exhibited less behavioral hyperactivity and anxiety, improved olfactory recognition, and spatial learning, but no significant reduction in the number of ictal discharges in comparison with their non-enriched cohorts. The beneficial effects of environmental enrichment in AY model were in some behavioral tests gender-specific in favor of males suggesting that other, possibly hormonally mediated mechanisms, may interact with the therapeutic effects of enrichment. Taken together, these data provide a starting point to derive clinical occupational therapies for improving behavioral outcome in cases of intractable childhood seizures.

"	"Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures usually refractory to pharmacological treatment. Patients generally continue with seizures despite treatment with the commercially available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Lacosamide (LCM) is a new AED recently approved for treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. Lacosamide has a novel mechanism of action that seems to be different in relation to other conventional AEDs. To report LCM-caused worsening of tonic seizures and electroencephalographic pattern in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We report the evolution of a patient with LGS resistant to several AEDs with a cryptogenic hepatopathy in whom LCM caused worsening of tonic seizures and electroencephalographic pattern. Once LCM was discontinued, the patient returned to his clinical and electrical baseline. Lennox Gastaut syndrome may exacerbate tonic seizures and electrical pattern of patients with LGS.

"	"This study sought to demonstrate the origin and propagation of paroxysmal fast activity (PFA) in patients with epileptic spasms (ESs), using time-frequency analyses of magnetoencephalogram (MEG) PFA recordings. A 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG, with a 600Hz sampling rate, was used to examine PFA in 3 children with ESs. We analyzed MEG recordings of PFA by short-time Fourier transform and the aberrant area or high-power spectrum was superimposed onto reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance images as moving images. One ictal discharge was collected. One child and one adult with PFA due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were also examined for comparison. All four PFAs in Patient 1 and five PFAs in Patient 3 were generated from one hemisphere. In Patient 2, four of seven PFAs were generated from one hemisphere and the remaining three were generated from both hemispheres. In Patient 3, one ictal MEG showed ictal discharges that were generated from the same area as the PFA, although the electroencephalogram showed no discharge. In Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, all 10 PFAs were generated from bilateral hemispheres simultaneously. Short-time Fourier transform analyses of MEG PFA can show the origin and form of propagation of PFA. These results suggest that ESs are representative of focal seizures and the mechanism of PFA is different between ESs and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"West syndrome consists of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental arrest. Most patients remain mentally retarded and many develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing we identified an ST3GAL3 mutation in three infants with West syndrome. ST3GAL3 encodes a sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of sialyl-Lewis epitopes on cell surface-expressed glycoproteins. The mutation affected an essential sialyl-motif and abolished enzymatic activity. Abnormalities in proteins involved in forebrain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic growth and function were recently proposed to account for infantile spasms. Dysfunctional ST3GAL3 may thus result in perturbation of the posttranslational sialylation of proteins in these pathways.

Subjects were prospectively recruited from children with epilepsy who satisfied the following criteria and underwent intensive examination between 2009 and 2012 in 14 collaborative centers: (1) younger than 6years old and (2) more than 10 seizures/month refractory to all available medical treatments including ACTH therapy, leading to significant psychosocial morbidity. We analyzed epilepsy onset age, predominant seizure type, etiology, neuropsychological findings, and syndromic classification according to the pre-determined registration format. A total of 314 children were enrolled in this study. Epilepsy onset age in 239 cases (80%) was younger than 12months. The most frequent seizure type was epileptic spasms (ES), followed by generalized tonic seizures (GTS), which accounted for 42% and 20%, respectively. West syndrome (WS) was the most frequent epileptic syndrome and accounted for 37%, followed by unclassified epilepsy at 21%, neocortical epilepsy at 19%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at 12%, Dravet syndrome at 4%, Rasmussen syndrome at 2%, and others. The two most frequent causes of epilepsy were cortical dysplasia and chromosomal anomalies, as shown in 16% and 6%, respectively. However, the etiology of nearly one half of all patients remained unknown. Psychomotor development was already worse than a moderate degree in 62% of subjects at the first examination. The highest proportion of catastrophic epilepsy was WS and its related syndromes featuring ES and GTS, followed by neocortical epilepsy, whose psychomotor development was significantly retarded at examinations.

She had previously refused the modified Atkins diet within 2 weeks of diet treatment because of its restrictiveness. The low glycemic index treatment was implemented by limiting the daily carbohydrate intake to 50 g of foods with a glycemic index of less than 50 relative to that of glucose, which included udon, soba, and unpolished Japonica rice with natto. One month after the initiation of the diet therapy, the clusters of tonic seizures for 30 to 60 minutes during sleep were reduced from two or three times per week to once or twice per month, and the frequent myoclonic seizures in the awake state disappeared. She has been on the diet therapy for more than 1 year, and the efficacy of the diet has been sustained. Low glycemic index treatment should be considered for patients with medication-resistant epilepsy who cannot tolerate restrictive diet therapies. Japanese ethnic foods can be used for this diet therapy.

This was a prospective, open-label study of intractable epilepsy patients treated with the classic KD with a lipid-to-nonlipid ratio 4:1 between October 2004 and July 2011 at five Chinese epilepsy centers. A total of 299 patients were enrolled. The patients were divided into different groups according to age (including the below-1-year-old group, 1-to-3-year-old group, 3-to-6-year-old group, 6-to-10-year-old group, and over-10-year-old group), etiology (cryptogenic epilepsy, symptomatic epilepsy, and idiopathic epilepsy), and the seizure types (included infantile spasm, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome, generalized epilepsy, and partial epilepsy). Parents were assigned to write seizure diaries which recorded the seizure presentations, tolerability, and complications associated with the KD. Patients' weight and height were measured every week. Blood β-hydroxybutyric acid, blood sugar, and urinary ketone bodies were monitored closely. Patients were followed up through telephone calls by the nutritionists every month and regular outpatient visits or hospitalizations were recommended at all time-points which included the third, sixth and twelfth month after initiation. Efficacy was measured through seizure frequency. The variables related to the efficacy were also analyzed. SPSS 17.0 was used for all statistical analysis. At 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation, 65.9%, 44.8%, and 26.4% patients remained on the diet, and 37.4%, 26.1%, and 20.4% had a > 50% reduction in their seizure frequency, including 21.7%, 10.7%, and 11.0% who became seizure free, respectively. At 24 months after initiation, 29 patients remained on the diet, and 28 patients had a > 90% seizure reduction, including five became seizure free. At 36 months after initiation, 7 patients remained on the diet, and all of them had a > 90% seizure reduction, including five became seizure free. No significant variables were related to the efficacy. Most complications were mild and reversible by conservative treatment. Gastrointestinal disturbances were the main complications, which included vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal cramp. Severe complications occurred in four cases, including severe metabolic disturbances and severe pneumonia. The KD is a safe and effective alternative therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy.

All patients with LGS who underwent CC for medically refractory epilepsy at Namazee Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran from May 2009 through March 2012 were reviewed in a retrospective study. Presurgical evaluation included clinical history, neurological examination, a 2-hour video-EEG recording, and 1.5-T MRI. Outcome was evaluated at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. We considered the outcome as a success if the patients were either seizure-free or had more than 85% reduction in seizure frequency compared to their preoperative status. Eighteen patients (14 males and 4 females) had surgery. Overall, seizures in 11 patients (61.1%) responded favorably one year after surgery; this figure was 6 out of 9 patients (66.6%) two years after surgery. Seven patients (38.8%) were free of disabling seizures one year after CC; this figure was three out of nine patients (33.3%) two years after CC. Three patients (16.6%) were free of all seizure types one year after surgery. Ten patients (55.5%) had no postoperative complications of any kind. Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative surgical procedure for patients with LGS with intractable seizures whose seizures are not amenable to focal resection. This is a feasible treatment option for patients, even for those in developing countries with limited resources.

"	"Nuclear import receptors of the KPNA family recognize the nuclear localization signal in proteins and together with importin-β mediate translocation into the nucleus. Accordingly, KPNA family members have a highly conserved architecture with domains that contact the nuclear localization signal and bind to importin-β. Here, we describe autosomal recessive mutations in KPNA7 found by whole exome sequencing in a sibling pair with severe developmental disability, infantile spasms, subsequent intractable epilepsy consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The mutations mapped to exon 7 in KPNA7 result in two amino-acid substitutions, Pro339Ala and Glu344Gln. On the basis of the crystal structure of the paralog KPNA2 bound to a bipartite nuclear localization signal from the retinoblastoma protein, the amino-acid substitutions in the affected subjects were predicted to occur within the seventh armadillo repeat that forms one of the two nuclear localization signal-binding sites in KPNA family members. Glu344 is conserved in all seven KPNA proteins, and we found that the Glu354Gln mutation in KPNA2 is sufficient to reduce binding to the retinoblastoma nuclear localization signal to approximately one-half that of wild-type protein. Our data show that compound heterozygous mutations in KPNA7 are associated with a human neurodevelopmental disease, and provide the first example of a human disease associated with mutation of a nuclear transport receptor.

A patient with DS without known mutation showed a partial control of all types of seizures in the first 13 months; then seizures worsened and verapamil was suspended. Two patients with structural epilepsy and one with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome showed no improvement. Any side effects were recorded. Add-on treatment with verapamil seems to have some effect in controlling seizures in patients with genetically determined DS.

Little has been described about the specific clinical or electroencephalography (EEG) features of LGS of unknown or genetic cause (LGS(u)). The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) aims to characterize LGS(u) by phenotypic analysis of patients with LGS(u) and their parents. One hundred thirty-five patients with LGS with no known etiology and their parents were enrolled from 19 EPGP centers in the United States and Australia. Clinical data from medical records, standardized questionnaires, imaging, and EEG were collected with use of online informatics systems developed for EPGP. LGS(u) in the EPGP cohort had a broad range of onset of epilepsy from 1 to 13 years, was male predominant (p < 0.0002), and was associated with normal development prior to seizure onset in 59.2% of patients. Despite the diagnosis, almost half of the adult patients with LGS(u) completed secondary school. Parents were cognitively normal. All subjects had EEG recordings with generalized epileptiform abnormalities with a spike wave frequency range of 1-5 Hz (median 2 Hz), whereas 8.1% of subjects had EEG studies with a normal posterior dominant rhythm. Almost 12% of patients evolved from West syndrome. LGS(u) has distinctive characteristics including a broad age range of onset, male predominance, and often normal development prior to the onset of seizures. Cognitive achievements such as completion of secondary school were possible in half of adult patients. Our phenotypic description of LGS(u) coupled with future genetic studies will advance our understanding of this epilepsy syndrome.

"	"Clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZD), was FDA-approved in October 2011 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years and older. BZDs exert various CNS effects through allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. The structurally distinct, 1,4-BZD clonazepam (CLN) is also approved to treat LGS. The precise mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of both are unknown. Data show that the GABAA α₁-subunit-selective compound zolpidem [ZOL] exhibits hypnotic/sedative effects. Conversely, data from knock-in mice carrying BZD binding site mutations suggest that the α₂ subunit mediates anticonvulsant effects, without sedative actions. Hence, the specific pattern of interactions across the GABAA receptor complexes of BZDs might be reflected in their clinical efficacies and adverse effect profiles. In this study, GABAA-receptor binding affinities of CLB, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB, the major metabolite of CLB), CLN, and ZOL were characterized with native receptors from rat-brain homogenates and on cloned receptors from HEK293 cells transfected with combinations of α (α₁, α₂, α₃, or α₅), β₂, and γ₂ subtypes. Our results demonstrate that CLB and N-CLB have significantly greater binding affinities for α₂- vs. α₁-receptor complexes, a difference not observed for CLN, for which no distinction between α₂ and α₁ receptors was observed. Our experiments with ZOL confirmed the high preference for α₁ receptors. These results provide potential clues to a new understanding of the pharmacologic modes of action of CLB and N-CLB.

"	"In October 2011, clobazam was FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a debilitating childhood epilepsy characterized by drop attacks, for patients 2 years and older. To assess the budget impact of adding clobazam to an antiepileptic drug (AED) portfolio containing topiramate, lamotrigine, and rufinamide in a hypothetical, 100,000-member commercially insured health plan. Patient characteristics and AED efficacy (decrease in drop-seizure frequency) were modeled with clinical data. Medical costs were derived from administrative claims data from a large U.S. managed health plan, with the assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures required medical care. Two-year budget impact was measured. Results were expressed as the overall difference in costs (medical and pharmacy) to a health plan and cost per member per month (PMPM) after addition of clobazam. Analyses of alternative scenarios were performed. With the assumption that 0.04% of the plan population had LGS, adding clobazam to the formulary resulted in cost savings of $98,059 in year 1 and $131,690 in year 2 (savings of $0.08 and $0.11 PMPM, respectively). Analyses of alternative scenarios with lower seizure rates upon discontinuation or greater long-term efficacy for lamotrigine and topiramate did not substantially alter conclusions. The assumption that fewer drop seizures required medical care resulted in a savings of approximately $5,000 per year with clobazam, which suggested that medically attended drop seizures drive costs. Medically attended drop seizures are a major cost driver for LGS patients. Adding clobazam to a health plan formulary can have a positive overall budget impact through decreased medical costs associated with drop seizures.

GPFA was originally described as an electrographic feature of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). We analyzed GPFA on scalp video EEG (VEEG) in children to evaluate that GPFA presents in patients with intractable localization-related epilepsy. We collected cases with GPFA with intractable localization-related epilepsy who underwent scalp VEEG, MRI, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) prior to intracranial video EEG (IVEEG) and surgical resection. We collected 50 epochs of GPFA per patient during the first night during scalp VEEG. We analyzed amplitude, duration and frequency of GPFA over the bilateral frontal region between surgical resection side with grid placement and non-resection side. We identified 14 (14%) patients with GPFA on scalp VEEG. The mean amplitude ranged from 145 to 589 μV (mean 293 μV). The mean duration ranged from 1.18 to 2.31s (mean 1.6s). The mean frequencies ranged from 9.3 to 14.7 Hz (mean 11.1 Hz). The amplitude (307 ± 156 μV) and duration (1.62 ± 0.8s) of GPFAs in all the patients over the resection side were significantly higher than those (279 ± 141 μV, 1.58 ± 0.8s) of the non-resection side (p<0.001). All nine patients who showed significant duration differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had longer duration of GPFA over the resection side. Eight of 12 patients who showed significant amplitude differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher amplitude of GPFA over the resection side. Four of six patients who showed significant frequency differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher frequency of GPFA over the resection side. Nine (64%) patients became seizure free after surgical resection including multilobar resections in eight patients. GPFA can exist in localization-related epilepsy with secondary bilateral synchrony. Although EEG shows GPFA on scalp VEEG, the precise localization of the epileptogenic zone using IVEEG could achieve the successful surgical resection.

Here we report on an open, retrospective, and pragmatic study about safety and efficacy of rufinamide in children aged less than four years, in terms of seizures types and epilepsy syndromes. Forty children (mean age 39.5 months; range 22-48) were enrolled in the study. The mean follow-up period was 12.2 months (range 5-21). Rufinamide was initiated at a mean age of 26.7 months (range 12-42). Final rufinamide mean dosage was 31.5 mg/kg/day if associated with valproic acid and 44.2 mg/kg/day if not. The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the epileptic spasms (46%) and drop attacks (42%) groups. Seizure reduction was also observed in tonic seizures (35%) and in the focal seizure (30%) groups. In terms of epilepsy syndrome, rufinamide was effective in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Results were very poor for those affected by Dravet's syndrome. Globally, responder rate was 27.5%, including two (5%) patients seizure-free. Adverse reactions occurred in 37.5% of children and were mainly represented by vomiting, drowsiness, irritability, and anorexia. Discontinuation rate due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 15%.

24912730	"Efficacy and safety of rufinamide in children under four years of age with drug-resistant epilepsies
"	"Studies on the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in infants and young children are scarce. Here we report on an open, retrospective, and pragmatic study about safety and efficacy of rufinamide in children aged less than four years, in terms of seizures types and epilepsy syndromes. Forty children (mean age 39.5 months; range 22-48) were enrolled in the study. The mean follow-up period was 12.2 months (range 5-21). Rufinamide was initiated at a mean age of 26.7 months (range 12-42). Final rufinamide mean dosage was 31.5 mg/kg/day if associated with valproic acid and 44.2 mg/kg/day if not. The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the epileptic spasms (46%) and drop attacks (42%) groups. Seizure reduction was also observed in tonic seizures (35%) and in the focal seizure (30%) groups. In terms of epilepsy syndrome, rufinamide was effective in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Results were very poor for those affected by Dravet's syndrome. Globally, responder rate was 27.5%, including two (5%) patients seizure-free. Adverse reactions occurred in 37.5% of children and were mainly represented by vomiting, drowsiness, irritability, and anorexia. Discontinuation rate due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 15%. The present study concludes that rufinamide may be a safe and effective drug for a broad range of seizures and epilepsy syndromes in infants and young children and represents a valid therapeutic option in this population.

24949576	"Withdrawal-related adverse events from clinical trials of clobazam in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
"	"To assess withdrawal-related adverse event (AE) rates following abrupt clobazam discontinuation in Phase I trials and gradual clobazam tapering (2-3 weeks) following discontinuation from III trials met the criteria for potential/III trials, we evaluated AE data from four multiple-dosage Phase I trials (duration: 8-34 days). Therapeutic (20 and 40 mg/day) and supratherapeutic clobazam dosages (120 and 160 mg/day) were administered. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome enrolled in Phase II (OV-1002) and Phase III (OV-1012) studies (duration ≤15 weeks) and in the open-label extension (OLE) trial OV-1004 (≤5 years). Potential withdrawal-related AEs were identified by preferred terms, provided that the AEs occurred ≥1 day following and ≤30 days after the last clobazam doses, or were deemed withdrawal symptoms by investigators. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) scale was used to evaluate withdrawal intensity in three of the four Phase I trials. A total of 207 participants in Phase I trials received steady-state clobazam dosages of 20-160 mg/day, 182 received clobazam dosages of ≥40 mg/day, and 94 received clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Abrupt clobazam discontinuation led to 193 withdrawal-related AEs for 68 Phase I participants. Nearly 50% of AEs occurred after discontinuation of clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate and included headache (14% of Phase I participants), insomnia (12.6%), tremor (10.1%), and anxiety (8.7%). The CIWA-B scores varied (range: 0-59). Most scores were <30, indicating possible mild benzodiazepine withdrawal. III trials met the criteria for potential/III patients received clobazam dosages of ≤40 mg/day, and those in the OLE trial received clobazam dosages of ≤80 mg/day. Eighty-seven patients discontinued clobazam and were gradually tapered. No withdrawal-related AEs or incidences of status epilepticus were reported. Withdrawal-related AEs observed in Phase I studies following abrupt clobazam discontinuation at therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosages were generally mild. No withdrawal-related AEs occurred when dosages were tapered over 3 weeks, after short- or long-term clobazam use (≤5 years).

25132372	"Exposure to rufinamide and risks of CNS adverse events in drug-resistant epilepsy: a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials
"	"Epilepsy is a complex disease necessitating continuous development of new therapeutic strategies to encounter drug-resistant cases. Among new adjuvant antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide is structurally distinct from other antiepileptic drugs. It is used to treat partial-onset seizures and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in adult and children. To date, there has been no attempt to evaluate systematically the risks of adverse events with rufinamide. We performed a quantitative risk analysis of central nervous system (CNS) adverse events of rufinamide from all randomized, double-blind, add-on, placebo-controlled trials. The meta-analysis was undertaken with fixed effects models. Of the 886 publications reviewed, 99 papers were retrieved and five articles met the inclusion criteria. One thousand two hundred and fifty-two patients were included. Our study showed that exposure to rufinamide was associated with a significant increase in risk of somnolence [relative ratio (RR) 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33, 2.62; P = 0.0003], dizziness (RR 2.66; 95% CI 2.00, 3.55; P = 0.00001), fatigue (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.57, 2.91; P = 0.01) and headache (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.02, 1.59, P = 0.03). In addition, exposure to rufinamide was associated with higher treatment discontinuation rates as compared with placebo (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.74, 4.03; P = 0.00001). The risk of CNS adverse events appears to be increased in patients exposed to rufinamide as well as the treatment discontinuation rates. However, although statistical associations were significant, additional long term safety studies are required to confirm the clinical significance of these findings, as most reports described only mild and moderate adverse events.

"	"This retrospective study included 54 children with epilepsy. The treatment consisted of four pulses with single doses of 20 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone (MPR), administered every week on 3 consecutive days. After this initial phase, the intervals between the pulses were increased based on individual factors. MPR pulses were administered exclusively orally in 39 patients and 7.8% of all pulses were applied intravenously. After four pulses, 30 of 54 (56%) patients were responders, according to several clinical and electroencephalography criteria. A response was obtained in 12 of 20 (60%) cases with genetic, 7 of 17 (41%) with structural metabolic, and 11 of 17 (65%) with unknown etiology. Responder rates were 11 of 15 (73%) in patients with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep (CSWS) or Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 2 of 6 in patients with myoclonic astatic epilepsy or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and 17 of 31 (55%) in patients with unclassified epilepsies. A response was not correlated with any epilepsy-related clinical factor. The patients received a median of eight MPR pulses (range, 1-52), and the median duration of the therapy was 11 weeks. The response was maintained in 19 of 30 (63%) patients, and 3 of 24 (13%) without initial response became seizure-free (total responder rate at the end of the therapy 22/54 [41%]). The majority of patients experienced adverse effects that were typically mild and transient.

"	"To gain insight into the long-term impact of vagus nerve stimulation (with VNS Therapy) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, we conducted the largest retrospective multicenter study to date over an extended follow-up period of up to 24 months. The primary objective was to assess change in seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type (defined as the most disabling seizure) following VNS device implantation. Treating physicians collected data from patient records from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. The analysis population included 347 children (aged 6 months to 17.9 years at the time of implant). At 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation, 32.5%, 37.6%, and 43.8%, respectively, of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in baseline seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type. The responder rate was higher in a subgroup of patients who had no change in antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during the study. Favorable results were also evident for all secondary outcome measures including changes in seizure duration, ictal severity, postictal severity, quality of life, clinical global impression of improvement, and safety. Post hoc analyses demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between VNS total charge delivered per day and an increase in response rate. VNS Therapy is indicated as adjunctive therapy in children with focal, structural epilepsies, who for any reason are not good candidates for surgical treatment following the trial of two or more AEDs. Children with predominantly generalized seizures from genetic, structural epilepsies, like Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, could also benefit from VNS Therapy. The results demonstrate that adjunctive VNS Therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy reduces seizure frequency and is well tolerated over a 2-year follow-up period. No new safety issues were identified. A post hoc analysis revealed a dose-response correlation for VNS in patients with epilepsy.

25336963	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: impact on the caregivers and families of patients
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) has a major impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of the affected children as well as their caregivers. The primary caregiver in the family is generally the mother, with support from the father and siblings. The burden of care and the effects of the disease on the child necessitate adjustments in virtually all aspects of the lives of their family. These adjustments inevitably affect the physical, emotional, social, and financial health of the whole family. Numerous sources of support for families can help to ease the burden of care. Improvements in the treatment of LGS, in addition to helping the child with LGS, would likely help improve the HRQL of the family members. This pilot parent survey was designed to explore the impact of epilepsy on caregiver HRQL. Parents of children with epilepsy who had contacted the Epilepsy Information Service at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, were sent questionnaires comprising open- and closed-ended questions. A total of 200 surveys were distributed, with a return rate of 48%. The results revealed that 74% of the parents believed that having a child with epilepsy brought them and their partner closer together. However, when the parents were asked to explain the manner in which epilepsy affected their families, answers included continuous stress, major financial distress, and lack of time to spend with other children. Information and resources for the families of children with LGS could help improve the HRQL of both the patients and their relatives.

"	"The 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older in the United States, and for treatment of anxiety and various forms of epilepsy elsewhere. Clobazam has been reported to exhibit different in vivo adverse effects and addiction liability profile than the classic 1,4-benzodiazepines. In this study, it was investigated whether the in vitro pharmacological properties of clobazam and its major active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam could explain some of these clinical differences. The functional properties of the two 1,5-benzodiazepines were characterized at the human γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S), α5β2γ(2S) and α6β2δ expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by use of two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology and compared to those exhibited by the 1,4-benzodiazepine clonazepam. All three compounds potentiated GABA EC20-evoked responses through the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, with each displaying similar EC50 values at the four subtypes. Furthermore, the degrees of potentiation of the GABA EC20 currents through the four receptors mediated by saturating modulator concentrations did not differ substantially for any of the three benzodiazepines. The three compounds were substantially less potent (200-3900 fold) as positive allosteric modulators at the α6β2δ GABA(A)R than at the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) receptors. Interestingly, however, clobazam and especially N-desmethylclobazam were highly efficacious potentiators of α6β2δ receptor signaling. Although this activity component is unlikely to contribute to the in vivo effects of clobazam/N-desmethylclobazam, the 1,5-benzodiazepine could constitute an interesting lead for novel modulators targeting this low-affinity binding site in GABAARs. In conclusion, the non-selective modulation exerted by clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam and clonazepam at the α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S) and α5β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs indicate that the observed clinical differences between clobazam and 1,4-benzodiazepines are likely to arise from factors other than their respective pharmacological properties at the GABA(A)Rs as investigated here.

De novo sequence mutations and copy number variants (CNVs) are causative in a subset of cases. We used exome sequence data in 349 trios with IS or LGS to identify putative de novo CNVs. We confirm 18 de novo CNVs in 17 patients (4.8%), 10 of which are likely pathogenic, giving a firm genetic diagnosis for 2.9% of patients. Confirmation of exome-predicted CNVs by array-based methods is still required due to false-positive rates of prediction algorithms. Our exome-based results are consistent with recent array-based studies in similar cohorts and highlight novel candidate genes for IS and LGS.

"	"The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (EE's) are seizure disorders that broadly impact development including cognitive, sensory and motor progress with severe consequences and comorbidities. Recently, mutations in DNM1 (dynamin 1) have been implicated in two EE syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Dnm1 encodes dynamin 1, a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Dnm1Ftfl or ""fitful"" mice carry a spontaneous mutation in the mouse ortholog of DNM1 and recapitulate many of the disease features associated with human DNM1 patients, providing a relevant disease model of human EE's. In order to examine the cellular etiology of seizures and behavioral and neurological comorbidities, we engineered a conditional Dnm1Ftfl mouse model of DNM1 EE. Observations of Dnm1Ftfl/flox mice in combination with various neuronal subpopulation specific cre strains demonstrate unique seizure phenotypes and clear separation of major neurobehavioral comorbidities from severe seizures associated with the germline model. This demonstration of pleiotropy suggests that treating seizures per se may not prevent severe comorbidity observed in EE associated with dynamin-1 mutations, and is likely to have implications for other genetic forms of EE.

26139309	"An integrative population pharmacokinetics approach to the characterization of the effect of hepatic impairment on clobazam pharmacokinetics
"	"An integrative population pharmacokinetics (PPK)-based approach was used to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on clobazam PK and its major metabolite in systemic circulation, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB). At therapeutic clobazam dosages, N-CLB plasma concentrations are 3-5 times greater than the parent compound. PK data from clinical trials in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS; OV-1002 and OV-1012), healthy participants (OV-1016), and participants with and without renal impairment (OV-1032), as well as those from a publication describing the effects of hepatic impairment on clobazam PK, were merged to create the PPK model. Individual patient clobazam PK parameters from the publication were used to generate patient plasma-concentration data. Clobazam PK was linear and the formation of N-CLB was elimination-rate limited. Hepatic impairment did not affect the total apparent clearance of clobazam but may affect the PK of N-CLB. Because the formation of N-CLB is elimination-rate limited and the total apparent clearance of clobazam is unaffected by hepatic impairment, the PPK model suggests that patients with LGS and hepatic impairment may not require clobazam dosage modification.

A description of endoscopic disconnection for a hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) and a review of the literature is also presented. Thirty four patients underwent endoscopic procedures between January 2010 and March 2015. These included endoscopic-assisted inter-hemispheric trans-callosal hemispherotomy (EH; n = 11), endoscopic-assisted corpus callosotomy with anterior/posterior commissurotomy (CCWC; n = 16), and endoscopic disconnection for HH (n = 7). EH and CCWC were performed with the use of a small craniotomy (4 cm × 3 cm). The surgeries were performed using a rigid high-definition endoscope, bayonetted self-irrigating bipolar forceps, and other standard endoscopic instruments along with the guidance of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigation. HH disconnection was performed using endoscopic neuronavigation through a burr hole. Hemispherotomy: Sequelae of middle cerebral artery infarct (5), Rasmussen's syndrome (3), and hemimegalencephaly (3). Class I Engel (9) and class II (2), mean follow-up of 8.4 months, range: 3-18 months. Mean blood loss: 85 cc, mean operating time: 210 min. CCWC: All had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), with etiologies of hypoxic insult (10), lissencephaly (2), bilateral band heterotropia (2), microgyria and pachygyria (2). Mean follow-up: 18 ± 4.7 (16-27 months). Drop attacks stopped in all the patients. Seizure frequency and duration decreased >90% (11) and >50% (5). HH: Type II (2), Type III (2), Type IV (3). 5 had IA outcome. The article emphasizes the role of endoscopic procedures for epilepsy surgery and provides a review of literature. This experience may subserve to coin the term ""endoscopic epilepsy surgery"" for a fast emerging subspeciality in the field of epilepsy surgery.

Our previous functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal diffuse association network activity underlies the epileptic discharges of this clinical phenotype.

We studied 9 adult patients and 14 controls. In 20 min of task-free blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data, two metrics of functional connectivity were studied: Regional homogeneity or local connectivity, a measure of concordance between each voxel to a focal cluster of adjacent voxels; and eigenvector centrality, a global connectivity estimate designed to detect important neural hubs. Multivariate pattern analysis of these data in a machine-learning framework was used to identify spatial features that classified disease subjects. Multivariate pattern analysis was 95.7% accurate in classifying subjects for both local and global connectivity measures (22/23 subjects correctly classified). Maximal discriminating features were the following: increased local connectivity in frontoinsular and intraparietal areas; increased global connectivity in posterior association areas; decreased local connectivity in sensory (visual and auditory) and medial frontal cortices; and decreased global connectivity in the cingulate cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and pons. Using a data-driven analysis method in task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show increased connectivity in critical areas of association cortex and decreased connectivity in primary cortex. This supports previous findings of a critical role for these association cortical regions as a final common pathway in generating the Lennox-Gastaut phenotype. Abnormal function of these areas is likely to be important in explaining the intellectual problems characteristic of this disorder.

"	"EEG/fMRI takes advantage of the high temporal resolution of EEG in combination with the high spatial resolution of fMRI. These features make it particularly applicable to the study of epilepsy in which the event duration (e.g., interictal epileptiform discharges) is short, typically less than 200 milliseconds. Interictal or ictal discharges can be identified on EEG and be used for source localization in fMRI analyses. The acquisition of simultaneous EEG/fMRI involves the use of specialized EEG hardware that is safe in the MR environment and comfortable to the participant. Advanced data analysis approaches such as independent component analysis conducted alone or sometimes combined with other, e.g., Granger Causality or ""sliding window"" analyses are currently thought to be most appropriate for EEG/fMRI data. These approaches make it possible to identify networks of brain regions associated with ictal and/or interictal events allowing examination of the mechanisms critical for generation and propagation through these networks. After initial evaluation in adults, EEG/fMRI has been applied to the examination of the pediatric epilepsy syndromes including Childhood Absence Epilepsy, Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), Dravet Syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Results of EEG/fMRI studies suggest that the hemodynamic response measured by fMRI may have a different shape in response to epileptic events compared to the response to external stimuli; this may be especially true in the developing brain. Thus, the main goal of this review is to provide an overview of the pediatric applications of EEG/fMRI and its associated findings up until this point.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epilepsy of childhood onset associated with intellectual disability and multiple seizure types. Characteristic interictal electrographic discharges include generalized paroxysmal fast activity and slow spike and wave, which we have previously shown recruit widespread areas of association cortex. We wished to determine whether patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have changes in cerebral volumes that match this pattern of cortical recruitment. High resolution T1 weighted structural MRI was collected from 10 patients with LGS and 10 age and sex matched controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to compare tissue volumes across the whole brain (grey matter, white matter and CSF) and pontine volume between patients and controls, as well as to identify other regions of maximal tissue loss. LGS patients showed a significant decrease in whole brain volume compared to controls. Cortical atrophy was prominent in the mesial frontal region and bilateral anterior temporal poles. White matter atrophy was widespread and included peri-central and premotor regions. Atrophy was prominent in the pons, particularly in the region of the reticular formation. Grey matter atrophy trended to progress with age. Grey and white matter atrophy are a feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Grey matter atrophy is apparent in the mesial frontal lobe suggesting this region may be an important node in the epilepsy network of LGS. Atrophy maximal in the pons and cerebellum mimics the patterns of seizure spread that has been previously observed during tonic seizures. This supports the idea that the pons is a key part of the epilepsy network in LGS.

The mean daily rufinamide dose was 32.0 mg/kg (range 12.5-66.7 mg/kg) in children and 24.7 mg/kg (range 5.0-47.0 mg/kg) in adults, and the most commonly used concomitant antiepileptic drugs were levetiracetam and valproate. Rufinamide was discontinued in 25 patients (43.1%) during the 1-year follow-up, and the most common reason was lack of effectiveness (n = 12, 20.7% of total). The frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was significantly reduced from baseline at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001), both in patients with generalized epilepsies and in patients with focal epilepsies. Significant seizure frequency reduction from baseline was observed at 12 months (P = 0.01) for tonic/atonic seizures and at 6 months (P = 0.001) for focal seizures. Side effects were reported in 21 patients (36.2%): nausea, vomiting and weight loss were most frequent. Rufinamide was well tolerated and was effective in reducing frequency of generalized tonic-clonic, tonic/atonic and focal seizures in both children and adults with severe refractory epilepsies, primarily LGS.

"	"To present a modified technique and early outcomes of a continent catheterizable vesicostomy in pediatric patients with either flaccid neurogenic bladder or intractable voiding dysfunction and large capacity bladder. Six patients underwent the procedure from October 2014 to December 2015. A 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made, avoiding intraperitoneal dissection. After adequate mobilization, a 2-cm vertical flap at the dome of the bladder was identified and tubularized over a 12Fr catheter with 4-0 vicryl suture. The tubularized flap was then intussuscepted into the bladder with four 4-0 polydioxanone sutures, creating a continent mechanism. The catheterizable channel was then tunneled to the umbilicus, the channel ostomy matured, and the cystotomy closed in two layers. The median patient age was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 12) years. All patients had urinary dysfunction requiring drainage from etiologies that included Eagle-Barrett syndrome (n = 2), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 1), and Spina bifida (n = 2). Median hospital length of stay was 8 (IQR 3) days. One patient had a superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics, and 1 patient required balloon dilation of the catheterizable channel at 3 months postoperatively, secondary to difficulty self-catheterizing. Five patients were successfully self-catheterizing at last follow-up. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR 5) months and there were no intra- or perioperative complications. Continent catheterizable vesicostomy is a novel technique for urinary drainage in patients with large bladder capacity that spares use of the appendix or ileum. Early results are encouraging, providing a catheterizable channel through the umbilicus without urinary leakage between catheterization.

This epilepsy syndrome resulted form a porencephalic cyst secondary to brain abscesses that occurred during the management of malnutrition due to untreated tyrosinemia type 1. We used a ketogenic diet as treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome taking into account dietary requirements for tyrosinemia type 1. The patient was transiently responder during a 6-month period. This report illustrates that ketogenic diet remains a therapeutic option even when additional dietary requirements are needed.

Between 2/1990 and 7/2013, we registered 48 patients with the electroclinical diagnostic criteria of ES in clusters WoH. We recognized two subgroups. In the first subgroup of 30 patients, ES started at a mean age of 10.6 months (range, 2-40 months). Ictal EEG recordings showed diffuse high-amplitude slow waves in 15 patients, diffuse slow waves followed by voltage attenuation in six patients, diffuse fast rhythms in five, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in three, and diffuse sharp waves in one. In the second subgroup of 18 patients, nine had electroclinical features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, four had epilepsy with myoclonic and atonic seizures, two had Dravet syndrome, one 6-year-old boy had a non-convulsive status epilepticus characterized by atypical absences associated with ES, one had epilepsy with migrating seizures of infancy, and one patient had clinical features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis with ES. ES started at a mean age of 6.3 years (range, 0.5-13 years). The ictal EEG recording during the ES showed diffuse fast rhythms in 10 cases, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in four, and diffuse slow waves in four. Our study shows two subgroups of children with ESWoH. The first subgroup had a well-defined electroclinical syndrome predominantly in infancy, and in the second subgroup ES was one more seizure type associated with an epileptic encephalopathy other than West syndrome predominantly occurring in childhood.

"	"The purpose of this study was to describe a series of patients with ictal crying to estimate its occurrence and characterize the clinical features and the underlying etiology. We retrospectively reviewed all the long-term video-EEG reports from Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center over a 12-year period (2004-2015) for the occurrence of the terms ""cry"" or ""sob"" or ""weep"" in the text body. All the extracted reports were reviewed, and patients with at least one episode of documented ictal crying at the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) were included in the study. During the study period, 5133 patients were investigated at our EMU. Thirty-two patients (0.6%) had at least one documented seizure accompanied by crying. Twenty-seven patients (26 women and one man) had psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), and five patients (0.1%) had epilepsy. Among patients with epileptic ictal crying, four patients had focal epilepsy (two had definite, and two had probable frontal lobe epilepsy), while one patient had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Ictal crying is a rare finding among patients evaluated at the EMUs. The most common underlying etiology for ictal crying is PNES. However, ictal crying is not a specific sign for PNES. Epileptic ictal crying is often a rare type of partial seizure in patients with focal epilepsy. Dacrystic seizures do not provide clinical value in predicting localization of the epileptogenic zone.

"	"The categorisation of the childhood epilepsies into a number of different syndromes has allowed greater insight into the prognosis, not only with regard to seizure control but also in relation to cognitive and behavioural outcome. The role of genetics in determining both the syndrome and the behavioural outcome remains promising, although the promise is still largely unfulfilled. The behavioural/psychiatric outcome of a selection of the large number of childhood epilepsy syndromes is presented. The rate of autism in West syndrome, particularly in children who have tuberous sclerosis with temporal tubers, is high. In Dravet syndrome there is a loss of skills, with an associated increase in behavioural problems. The frequency of both subtle and overt seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome almost certainly accounts for the apparent poor motivation; however, a marked improvement in seizure control with treatment can also result in behavioural problems, probably as a result of the ""release phenomenon"". A number of cognitive problems can arise in the so-called ""benign"" syndrome of epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and the rate of ADHD is high. Autistic features and ADHD have been described in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and other syndromes associated with electrical status epilepticus of slow-wave sleep (ESES). Early effective treatment may reverse some of these features. There is clear evidence for a behavioural syndrome in relation to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), in which both clinical descriptions and functional neuroimaging indicate frontal lobe deficits.

Our previous study of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children with focal epilepsy showed significant reduction in epileptiform discharges. We hypothesized that cathodal tDCS when applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) combined with pharmacologic treatment will be more effective for reducing seizure frequency in patients with LGS than pharmacologic treatment alone. Study participants were randomized to receive either (1) pharmacologic treatment with five consecutive days of 2 mA cathodal tDCS over M1 for 20 min or (2) pharmacologic treatment plus sham tDCS. Measures of seizure frequency and epileptic discharges were performed before treatment and again immediately post-treatment and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week follow-up. Twenty-two patients with LGS were enrolled. Participants assigned to the active tDCS condition reported significantly more pre- to post-treatment reductions in seizure frequency and epileptic discharges that were sustained for 3 weeks after treatment. Five consecutive days of cathodal tDCS over M1 combined with pharmacologic treatment appears to reduce seizure frequency and epileptic discharges. Further studies of the potential mechanisms of tDCS in the LGS are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02731300 (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov).

"	"Doose and Lennox-Gastaut (syndromes) are rare generalized electroclinical affections of early infancy of variable prognosis which manifest with very diverse kinds of seizures. Very frequently, these types of epilepsy become drug resistant and finding reliable treatment results is very difficult. As a result of this, fighting against these syndromes becomes a long term (or endless) event for the little patient, the neurologist and the parents. A lot of Electroencephalographic (EEG) records are so accumulated during the child's life in order to monitor evolution and correlate it with medications. So, given a bunch of EEG, three questions arise: (a) On which year was the child healthier (less affected by seizures)? (b) Which area of the brain has been the most affected? (c) What is the status of the child with respect to others (which also have a bunch of EEG, each)? Answering these interrogations by traditional scrutinizing of the whole database becomes subjective, if not impossible. We propose to answer these questions objectively by means of time series entropies. We start with our modified version of the Multiscale Entropy (MSE) in order to generalize it as a Bivariate MSE (BMSE) and from them, we compute two indices. All were tested in a series of patients and coincide with medical conclusions. As far as we are concerned, our contribution is new.

"	"Callosotomy can reveal hidden primary epileptogenic areas in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We studied the significance of causal connectivity for identifying hidden epileptogenic areas in preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and for making a decision regarding resective surgery. We enrolled 18 LGS patients who underwent corpus callosotomy. Eight patients with unilateral epileptogenicity on post-callosotomy EEG underwent resective surgery (group A). Ten patients with independent bilateral epileptogenicity did not undergo resective surgery (group B). We analyzed generalized epileptiform discharges on pre-callosotomy EEG via direct directed transfer function (dDTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC). All regions exhibiting unilaterality in group A and bilaterality identified by dDTF or PDC in group B were concordant with the lateralization of the irritative zone on post-callosotomy EEG and with the localization of the resective areas, except for one patient in group A. The regions identified by dDTF exhibited high concordance rates with the resective areas in patients with good outcomes. Causal connectivity methods showed good concordance with hidden epileptogenic areas, and its concordance was associated with the prognosis of surgical outcome. This study provides evidence that causal connectivity methods can be helpful in deciding which type of surgery will be suitable for an LGS patient.

Ten children with super-refractory status epilepticus, ages 2-16 years, were identified. 4/10 patients had immune mediated encephalitis, including Rasmussen encephalitis, anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis, and post-infectious mycoplasma encephalitis. Other etiologies included Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, PCDH19 and GABRG2 genetic epilepsy, New Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus, and Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome. 4/10 patients' EEG features suggested focal with status epilepticus, and 6/10 suggested generalized with status epilepticus. Median hospital length was 61days and median ICU length was 27days. The median number of antiepileptic medications prior to diet initiation was 3.0 drugs, and the median after ketogenic diet treatment was 3.5 drugs. Median duration of status epilepticus prior to KD was 18days. 9/10 patients had resolution of super-refractory status epilepticus in a median of 7days after diet initiation. 8/9 patients were weaned off anesthesia within 15days of diet initiation, and within 1day of achieving ketonuria. 1/10 patients experienced side effects on the diet requiring supplementation. Most patients achieved resolution of status epilepticus on KD therapy, suggesting it could be an effective therapy that can be utilized early in the treatment of children with super refractory status epilepticus.

Enrolled patients started at 0.5 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) clobazam, not to exceed 40 mg/d. After 48 hours, dosages could be adjusted up to 2.0 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) (maximum 80 mg/d) on the basis of efficacy and tolerability. Post hoc analyses evaluated mean dosages and drop-seizure rates for the first 2 years of the open-label extension based on responder categories and baseline seizure quartiles in OV-1012. Individual patient listings were reviewed for dosage increases ≥40% and increasing seizure rates. Data from 200 patients were included. For patients free of drop seizures, there was no notable change in dosage over 24 months. For responder groups still exhibiting drop seizures, dosages were increased. Weekly drop-seizure rates for 100% and ≥75% responders demonstrated a consistent response over time. Few patients had a dosage increase ≥40% associated with an increase in seizure rates. Two-year findings suggest that the majority of patients do not develop tolerance to the antiseizure actions of clobazam. Observed dosage increases may reflect best efforts to achieve seizure freedom. It is possible that the clinical development of tolerance to clobazam has been overstated. NCT00518713 and NCT01160770.

The aim of this study was to determine if the adjunctive use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with LGS and drug-resistant epilepsy is efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency and also to investigate its safety and tolerability. Methods: This was an open-label pilot study with convenience sampling from one center. Bitemporal electrode placement was selected. ECT was administered three times per week for four weeks (considered as the induction phase), and then once a week for two months (considered as the maintenance phase). Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2, 3, 4, and 6 months to determine the seizure types and counts and also to determine the safety and tolerability of adjunctive use of ECT in these patients. All patients and / or their caregivers consented in writing to their participation. Results: Seven patients were studied. Just one patient experienced more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. One patient experienced more than 50% seizure increase with ECT. In three patients, there was an increase in aggressive behavior after receiving ECT. Two patients experienced mild and transient ataxia with ECT. One patient experienced mutism with ECT, which was transient and resolved with the termination of the procedure. Conclusion: In this small study, adjunctive use of an intensive ECT program in patients with LGS was not efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency. However, the safety profile was acceptable, and patients tolerated the adjunctive use of ECT very well. This finding can pave the road for future investigations.

We reviewed phenotypic data of 21 patients (7 previously published) with DNM1 mutations. We compared mutation data to known functional data and undertook biomolecular modeling to assess the effect of the mutations on protein function. We identified 19 patients with de novo mutations in DNM1 and a sibling pair who had an inherited mutation from a mosaic parent. Seven patients (33.3%) carried the recurrent p.Arg237Trp mutation. A common phenotype emerged that included severe to profound intellectual disability and muscular hypotonia in all patients and an epilepsy characterized by infantile spasms in 16 of 21 patients, frequently evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Two patients had profound global developmental delay without seizures. In addition, we describe a single patient with normal development before the onset of a catastrophic epilepsy, consistent with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome at 4 years. All mutations cluster within the GTPase or middle domains, and structural modeling and existing functional data suggest a dominant-negative effect on DMN1 function. The phenotypic spectrum of DNM1-related encephalopathy is relatively homogeneous, in contrast to many other genetic epilepsies. Up to one-third of patients carry the recurrent p.Arg237Trp variant, which is now one of the most common recurrent variants in epileptic encephalopathies identified to date. Given the predicted dominant-negative mechanism of this mutation, this variant presents a prime target for therapeutic intervention.

The peak period for manifestations of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is between ages 3 and 5 years, a time of critical brain development and corresponding vulnerability to the electroclinical dysfunction arising from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Diagnosis is based on a triad of symptoms: multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment, and slow spike-and-wave pattern on electroencephalography. In practice, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presentation is diverse, and there may be a delay between initial symptoms and emergence of the full triad of clinical features. Additionally, differential diagnosis is complicated by the resemblance of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to other forms of epilepsy and by the need for varied diagnostic techniques requiring specific clinical skills. Because diagnosis is complex and early intervention may lead to improved outcomes, clinicians should consider treatment when Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptoms are present, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis.

"	"To identify abnormal thalamocortical circuits in the severe epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that may explain the shared electroclinical phenotype and provide potential treatment targets. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of LGS (mean age = 28.5 years) and 26 healthy controls (mean age = 27.6 years) were compared using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The thalamus was parcellated according to functional connectivity with 10 cortical networks derived using group-level independent component analysis. For each cortical network, we assessed between-group differences in thalamic functional connectivity strength using nonparametric permutation-based tests. Anatomical locations were identified by quantifying spatial overlap with a histologically informed thalamic MRI atlas. In both groups, posterior thalamic regions showed functional connectivity with visual, auditory, and sensorimotor networks, whereas anterior, medial, and dorsal thalamic regions were connected with networks of distributed association cortex (including the default-mode, anterior-salience, and executive-control networks). Four cortical networks (left and right executive-control network; ventral and dorsal default-mode network) showed significantly enhanced thalamic functional connectivity strength in patients relative to controls. Abnormal connectivity was maximal in mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. Specific thalamocortical circuits are affected in LGS. Functional connectivity is abnormally enhanced between the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus and the default-mode and executive-control networks, thalamocortical circuits that normally support diverse cognitive processes. In contrast, thalamic regions connecting with primary and sensory cortical networks appear to be less affected. Our previous neuroimaging studies show that epileptic activity in LGS is expressed via the default-mode and executive-control networks. Results of the present study suggest that the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus may be candidate targets for modulating abnormal network behavior underlying LGS, potentially via emerging thalamic neurostimulation therapies.

"	"To define the electroclinical phenotype and long-term outcomes in a cohort of patients with inv dup (15) syndrome. The electroclinical data of 45 patients (25 males) affected by inv dup (15) and seizures were retrospectively analysed, and long-term follow-up of epilepsy was evaluated. Epilepsy onset was marked by generalized seizures in 53% of patients, epileptic spasms in 51%, focal seizures in 26%, atypical absences in 11% and epileptic falls in 9%. The epileptic syndromes defined were: generalized epilepsy (26.7%), focal epilepsy (22.3%), epileptic encephalopathy with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type (17.7%) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (33.3%). Drug-resistant epilepsy was detected in 55.5% of patients. There was a significant higher prevalence of seizure-free patients in those with seizure onset after the age of 5 years and with focal epilepsy, with respect to those with earlier epilepsy onset because most of these later developed an epileptic encephalopathy (69.2% vs 34.4%; P = .03), usually Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in type. In fact, among patients with early-onset epilepsy, those presenting with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type associated with classical hypsarrhythmia achieved seizure freedom (P < .001) compared to patients with spasms and other seizure types associated with modified hypsarrhythmia. Epilepsy in inv dup (15) leads to a more severe burden of disease. Frequently, these patients show drug resistance, in particular when epilepsy onset is before the age of five and features epileptic encephalopathy.

"	"Four antiseizure drugs have been approved in the United States since 2008. Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, was approved in October 2011 as an adjunctive therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years and older. Lacosamide, an amino acid that selectively enhances the slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, was approved in October 2008 as an add-on therapy for partial onset seizures in patients 17 years and older. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, was approved in November 2008 as an adjunctive therapy for LGS in patients 4 years and older. Vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, was approved in August 2009 for the treatment of infantile spasms in children ages 1 month to 2 years and intractable complex partial seizures in adults.

"	"Wikipedia is the most commonly accessed source of health information by both healthcare professionals and the lay public worldwide. We aimed to evaluate information-seeking behavior of Internet users searching the Italian Wikipedia for articles related to epilepsy and its treatment. Using Pageviews Analysis, we assessed the total and mean monthly views of articles from the Italian Wikipedia devoted to epilepsy, epileptic syndromes, seizure type, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017. We compared the views of the article on epilepsy with those of articles focusing on Alzheimer's disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, syncope, and stroke and adjusted all results for crude disease prevalence. With the only exception of the article on multiple sclerosis, the adjusted views for the Italian Wikipedia article on epilepsy were higher than those for the other neurological disorders. The most viewed articles on seizure type were devoted to tonic-clonic seizure, typical absence seizure, tonic convulsive seizures, and clonic convulsive seizures. The most frequently accessed articles on epilepsy syndromes were about temporal lobe epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The most frequently viewed articles on AEDs were devoted to valproic acid, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam. Wikipedia searches seem to mirror patients' fears and worries about epilepsy more than its actual epidemiology. The ultimate reasons for searching online remain unknown. Epileptologists and epilepsy scientific societies should make greater efforts to work jointly with Wikipedia to convey more accurate and up-to-date information about epilepsy.

"	"Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) involves infantile-onset acute hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus with subsequent unilateral cerebral atrophy and hemiparesis. Chronic epilepsy later develops, typically involving refractory focal seizures; however, the underlying pathophysiology of this epilepsy is not well understood. We present a boy who had a typical acute presentation of HHE at 23 months, but an unusual evolution to chronic epilepsy in which the initially unaffected hemisphere was significantly abnormal. His initial acute presentation was right-sided hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus, with subsequent left cerebral hemiatrophy and hemiparesis affecting the right face, arm and leg. Focal seizures began at 5 years and were refractory to medical treatment. At 9 years, video EEG monitoring showed a striking pattern of interictal slow spike-wave and paroxysmal fast activity, maximal over the right, initially unaffected, hemisphere. He had primarily focal tonic seizures involving left-sided stiffening, also appearing to originate from the right hemisphere. Following left functional hemispherotomy he became seizure-free and parents reported improved cognitive function, attention and quality of life. This boy had classic features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but expressed almost exclusively over the right hemisphere, which was initially unaffected in his acute presentation of HHE. His evolution to ""hemi-Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype"" illustrates the importance of monitoring chronic epilepsy in patients with HHE; early surgical intervention might prevent pathologic recruitment of bilateral secondary networks leading to the refractory seizures and cognitive impairment associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

"	"Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug and commonly used in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the present study, we investigated effects of rufinamide on cognitive function using passive avoidance test and neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus using Ki-67 (a marker for cell proliferation), doublecortin (DCX, a marker for neuroblast) and BrdU/NeuN (markers for newly generated mature neurons) immunohistochemistry in aged gerbils. Aged gerbils (24-month old) were treated with 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg rufinamide for 4 weeks. Treatment with 3 mg/kg rufinamide, not 1 mg/kg rufinamide, significantly improved cognitive function and increased neurogenesis, showing that proliferating cells (Ki-67-immunoreactive cells), differentiating neuroblasts (DCX-immunoreactive neuroblasts) and mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN-immunoreactive cells) in the aged dentate gyrus compared with those in the control group. When we examined its mechanisms, rufinamide significantly increased immunoreactivities of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), its receptor (IGF-1R), and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB). However, rufinamide did not show any increase in immunoreactivities of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor. Therefore, our results indicate that rufinamide can improve cognitive function and increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the aged gerbil via increasing expressions of IGF-1, IGF-1R and p-CREB.

"	"To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology guideline for managing treatment-resistant (TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 2004 criteria were used to systemically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strength. Forty-two articles were included. The following are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment); rufinamide for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (add-on therapy). The following should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B): lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month-16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6-17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month-4 years). The text presents Level C recommendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, and AED tolerability, safety, and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates seizure types and syndromes needing more evidence. A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.

"	"Developmental encephalopathic epilepsies (DEEs) are characterized by refractory seizures, disability, and early death. Opportunities to improve care and outcomes focus on West syndrome/infantile spasms (WS/IS). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is almost as common but receives little attention. We examined initial presentations of DEEs and their evolution over time to identify risk and indicators of developing LGS. Data are from the Connecticut Study of Epilepsy, a prospective, longitudinal study of 613 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy recruited in 1993-1997. Central review of medical records permitted classification of epilepsy syndromes at diagnosis and at reclassification 2, 5, and 9 years later. DEEs were compared to other epilepsies for seizure and cognitive outcomes and mortality. Analyses examined the evolution of DEE syndromes after initial presentation, with specific comparisons made between WS/IS and LGS. Statistical analyses were performed with t tests and chi-square tests. Fifty-eight children (9.4%) had DEEs, median onset age = 1.1 years (interquartile range ([IQR] 0.3-1.3) in DEEs and 6.0 years (IQR 3.0-9.0) in other epilepsies (P < 0.001). DEEs vs other epilepsies had more pharmacoresistance (71% vs 18%), intellectual disability (84% vs 11%), and mortality (21% vs <1%; all P < 0.001). During follow-up, the form of epilepsy evolved in 33 children. WS/IS was the most common initial diagnosis (N = 23) and in 5 children WS/IS evolved later. LGS was diagnosed initially in 4 children (1 later revised) and in 22 by the end of follow-up, including 7 evolving from WS/IS and 12 from nonsyndromic generalized, focal, or undetermined epilepsies. Evolution to LGS took a median of 1.9 years. LGS developed in 13% of infants, including 9% of those who did not present initially with WS/IS. DEEs account for disproportionate amounts of pharmacoresistance, disability, and early mortality. LGS often has a window between initial presentation and full expression. LGS should become targeted for early detection and prevention.

30357823	"Pharmacokinetics of clobazam oral soluble film
"	"Clobazam oral soluble film (COSF) is a novel dosage form under development for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The present study was undertaken to assess the pharmacokinetics of clobazam administered as single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg compared with clobazam tablets (CTAB) 20 and 10 mg in healthy adults. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg. A total of 51 adult volunteers were enrolled in a single-dose, open-label, randomized four-sequence, four-period, crossover study with treatments (A) COSF 20 mg, (B) CTAB 20 mg, (C) COSF 10 mg, and (D) CTAB 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic sampling for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam was carried out until 21 days postdose with a 28-day washout. Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study. Visual inspections of the administration site were performed before and after COSF administration to monitor for mucosal irritation. COSF at single doses of 10 and 20 mg was bioequivalent to CTAB at equivalent doses for both clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam. The pharmacokinetics of both formulations was dose-proportional at doses of 10 and 20 mg. The number of AEs and the number of subjects experiencing AEs were dose-related across the treatment groups, with somnolence the most common event. None of these events was severe or serious, and most were mild. There was no evidence for local irritation at the administration site following COSF. COSF is a novel clobazam dosage form that is bioequivalent to CTAB. Because of its ease of administration, COSF may be expected to improve adherence, reduce likelihood of dosing error, and provide more accurate dosing than formulations of clobazam that are currently available.

Our patient presented at the age of 3 years 6 months atypical absence. His electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized spikes and waves andpolyspikes and waves. At age 6, he has developed other types of seizures: slow fall of the head, shoulders jerks,slow fall to the side and loss of consciousness. All these phenomena were organized in a fortuitous and variable association from one period to another over 2 years. Meanwhile, the child developed cognitive impairment. EEG showed fast rhythms in sleep and waking. It was only at the age of 8years, whenthe child developedtonic seizures,that we made the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the absence of Specific Markers, syndromic diagnosis in epilepsy remains Electro- clinical.

"	"We aimed to determine the characteristics of epileptic seizures that significantly affect the cognitive functions of 83 patients followed with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), their resistance to treatment and risk factors causing this resistance. In order to determine the prognosis, the seizure-free/seizure-controlled group and the group with refractory seizures were compared. In addition, risk factors affecting cognitive functions in the patients were determined. There was a statistical significance between the presence of a history of seizures in the neonatal period, the age of onset of seizures being less than 2 years of age, autism, status epilepticus, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), presence of infantile spasm, generalization of the electroencephalography (EEG) findings, the number of tubers in cerebral imaging being more than three and refractory seizures (p < 0.05). Statistically significant relationship was found between presence of a history of seizures in the neonatal period, the age of onset of seizures, autism, LGS, presence of infantile spasm, presence of status epilepticus history, history of using more than three antiepileptic drugs, generalization of EEG findings, presence of SEGA in cerebral imaging, number of tubers being more than three and the patient's mental retardation (p < 0.05). In logistic regression analysis, the age of the seizure onset being less than 2 years of age, the presence of autism and number of tubers being more than three in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are determined to be the risk factors that most likely to increase the seizures to be more resistant.

"	"The ketogenic diet (KD) is often started not only for seizure reduction but also to potentially wean antiseizure drugs (ASDs) in children with epilepsy. Although there have been several publications regarding ASD reduction on the KD, it is unknown how often complete medication withdrawal occurs. We reviewed the charts of all children started on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital from 1/11 to 4/18. Children were defined as achieving drug-free diet (DFD) status if they started the KD on at least 1 ASD and achieved a period of time where they were on the KD alone. Over the time period, 232 children were evaluated; DFD status occurred in 43 (18.5%), of which 32 (13.8% of the full cohort) remained off ASDs for the remainder of their KD treatment course. Eleven children restarted ASD after a mean of 7 months. Children achieving DFD therapy were more likely to be younger, have fewer ASDs at KD onset, have Glut1 deficiency or epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, but were less likely to have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or a gastrostomy tube.

"	"The objective of the study was to assess the direct cost of medically treated seizure events in severe childhood-onset epilepsies. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representative conditions associated with frequent intractable seizures. Commercial and Medicaid insurance claims from 2010 to 2015 were queried to identify patients with possible LGS, possible DS, or TSC, having ≥2 years of continuous insurance from the date of first epilepsy/seizure diagnosis or antiepileptic drug (AED) fill (index date). Utilization and cost data in patients with and without seizure events requiring acute treatment were evaluated for two years postindex. Medically treated seizure events resulting in minor, moderate, severe, and no injury were included. Average costs were normalized to 2017 dollars at 3% per annum and reported for each cohort, by insurance type and degree of injury. Among 9754 patients, 55.4-58.8% of LGS, 47.7-55.8% of DS, and 13.7-28.0% of TSC cohorts had ≥1 medically treated seizure event, depending on insurance type. Events during two-year postindex averaged 2.8-3.3 in LGS, 3.1-3.3 in DS, and 1.9-2.2 in TSC; cost per event averaged $8147-$14,759 in LGS, $4637-$8751 in DS, and $5335-$9672 in TSC. In patients with events, average all-cause costs per-patient-per-year (PPPY) were $71,512-$84,939 in LGS; $31,278-$43,758 in DS; and $42,997-$48,330 in TSC. Patients with intractable seizures having at least one medically treated seizure event incur substantial all-cause costs. Our results can be used to inform cost effectiveness and budget impact models to estimate the value of existing and future treatments for these and similar conditions.

"	"Describe the development of a claims-based classifier utilizing machine learning to identify patients with probable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) from six state Medicaid programs. Patients were included if they had ≥2 medical claims ≥30 days apart for specified or unspecified epilepsy, excluding those with ≥1 claim for petit mal status. The LGS classifier utilized a random forest algorithm, a compilation of thousands of binary decision trees in which machine-generated predictor variables split the data set into branches that predict the presence or absence of LGS. To construct the splitting rules, the importance of each candidate variable was determined by calculating the mean decrease in Gini impurity. Training and testing were performed on two data sets (30% and 70%) using a ""true"" LGS and non-LGS patient population. Performance was compared with logistic regression and single tree methodology. Using a 60% probability threshold, which yielded the highest sensitivity (97.3%) and specificity (95.6%), the classifier identified approximately 4% of patients with epilepsy as probable LGS. The most important input variables included number of distinct antiepileptic drugs received, epilepsy-related outpatient/inpatient visits, electroencephalogram procedures and claims for delayed development. The random forest methodology outperformed logistic regression and single tree methodology. Most of the important LGS predictor characteristics identified by the classifier were statistically significantly associated with LGS status (p < .05). The claims-based LGS classifier showed high sensitivity and specificity, outperformed single tree and logistic regression methodologies and identified a prevalence of probable LGS that was similar to previously published estimates.

"	"Drug development for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is based on clinical trials that use drop seizure counts. However, such counts do not assess total seizure burden and affect a patient's quality of life (QoL). In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated two novel seizure efficacy parameters related to QoL in pediatric patients with LGS, using seizure diary data from rufinamide Study 303 (NCT01405053). Study 303 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study involving patients aged ≥1 to <4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive add-on therapy with rufinamide or any other approved antiseizure drug (ASD), in addition to their existing treatment of 1-3 ASDs, across a 106-week treatment phase. Seizure diaries, completed by parents or caregivers, recorded seizure occurrence, and were used in this post hoc analysis to evaluate two novel efficacy parameters comparing baseline vs postbaseline mean number of seizure-free days and assessing time to reach the number of prerandomization seizures for patients receiving rufinamide or any other ASD. Patients received rufinamide (n = 25) or any other ASD (n = 12). For rufinamide, mean number of seizure-free days was 42.2% greater postbaseline compared with baseline (P < 0.0001); only one rufinamide patient experienced a decrease in number of seizure-free days postbaseline. Median time to reach the baseline number of seizures increased by 10.5 days for rufinamide and 0.5 days for the any-other-ASD group during the treatment phase, to 46.0 and 54.0 days, respectively. Both of these novel and contrasting endpoints demonstrated potential improvements in seizure outcomes in patients receiving rufinamide postbaseline vs baseline. Although these parameters should be investigated in larger patient populations, our initial findings suggest that they could be applied as predefined primary endpoints for seizure assessment in future clinical trials for LGS drug development.

"	"A pharmaceutical grade formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) has been approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; however, this formulation is not yet available to patients outside the USA. In addition, CBD is thought to have broad anti-seizure properties that may be beneficial for other types of intractable epilepsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of artisanal medical CBD oil in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) at the tertiary epilepsy center of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome, Italy. This was a single-center, prospective, open-label study. Patients aged from 1 to 18 years with DEE and seizures refractory to appropriate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and other alternative treatments (i.e., vagal nerve stimulator and ketogenic diet) were included. Crystalline extract CBD powder (98-99% pure) in an oil artisanal formulation was added to the baseline AED regimen at a dosage of 2-5 mg/kg/day divided for twice-daily administration, then up-titrated until intolerance or a maximum dosage of 25 mg/kg/day was reached. Patients were treated for at least 6 months. Efficacy, safety and tolerability of CBD treatment were assessed through the evaluation of seizure frequency and reports of adverse effects. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study (41.4% male). The mean duration of exposure to artisanal CBD was 11.2 months [range 6-25 months; standard deviation (SD) ± 4.4 months]. Mean age at study enrollment was 9.3 years (range 1.9-16.3 years; SD ± 4.7 years). Eleven out of 29 patients (37.9%) had a ≥ 50% improvement in seizure frequency; one patient became seizure free. None of the patients reported worsening seizure frequency; however, 18 patients (62.1%) experienced no beneficial effect regarding seizure frequency. Adverse effects were reported in seven patients (24.14%), most commonly somnolence, decreased appetite and diarrhea. Adverse events were mild and transient, and no dose modification of CBD or other AEDs was required. These data suggest that CBD may have beneficial effects in patients with DEE and an acceptable safety profile. Placebo-controlled randomized trials should be conducted to formally assess the safety and efficacy of CBD in patients with DEE.

Broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, such as brivaracetam and clobazam are good choices for generalized tonic colonic seizures and are well tolerated.New sodium channel blockers such as lacosamide and eslicarbazepine, have a more ""benign"" side effect profile than the first or second generation of sodium channel blockers. These new drugs are useful therapies in patients with epilepsy of difficult control. Cannabidiol and fenfluramine are useful in the treatment of Dravet or Lennox Gastaut syndrome.

"	"With this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that the effect of cannabidiol on drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome could be attributed to a drug-drug interaction with clobazam. We performed clinical trial simulations for the effect of 20 mg/kg/day cannabidiol on drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We assumed that patients taking 10 or 20 mg clobazam would have a 2- to 7-fold increase in N-desmethylclobazam exposure, whereas patients not taking clobazam would have a median reduction in drop-seizure frequency and a variability in the percent reduction similar to the placebo group. The results show that the effect of cannabidiol on the median reduction in drop-seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may be explained by a drug-drug interaction with clobazam.

31677157	"CHD2-related epilepsy: novel mutations and new phenotypes
"	"The aim of this report was to refine the genotypes and phenotypes of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2)-related epilepsy. Seventeen patients with CHD2 mutations were enrolled. CHD2 mutations were identified by application of next-generation sequencing of epilepsy or whole exome sequencing. Sixteen mutations were identified, among which 15 have not yet been reported. Thirteen mutations were de novo. Age at seizure onset ranged from 3 months to 10 years 5 months. Seizures observed were generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, atonic, atypical absence, focal, and myoclonic-atonic. Epileptic spasms occurred in two patients. Developmental disability was present in 14 patients. Autism features were observed in seven patients. Video electroencephalogram was abnormal in 15 patients. Five patients were diagnosed with non-specific epileptic encephalopathy, two with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, two with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two with febrile seizures plus, and one with West syndrome. Seizures were controlled in nine patients. Q1392TfsX17 may be a hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome was observed as a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation. The severity of the phenotypes of CHD2 mutations ranged from mild febrile seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathy. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Q1392TfsX17 maybe the hot-spot mutation of CHD2. West syndrome could be a new phenotype of CHD2 mutation.

31879735	"Epilepsy in Christianson syndrome: Two cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and a review of literature
"	"Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked intellectual disorder caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene. Clinical features of CS include an inability to speak, truncal ataxia, postnatal microcephaly, hyperkinesis, and epilepsy. Almost all patients with CS develop drug-resistant epilepsy-its most serious complication. We report two cases of CS with drug-resistant epilpesy associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). One patient experienced generalized tonic seizures since 9 months of age with cognitive regression, which evolved to include atonic seizures at the age of 7 years. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized slow spike-wave complexes and generalized paroxysmal fast activity. Seizures remained drug-resistant despite multiple anti-seizure drugs. The second patient experienced generalized tonic seizures since the age of 17 months and arrested development. EEG showed generalized slow spike-wave complexes, with frequent atonic seizures since the age of 6 years. Electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES) developed at the age of 7 years. Our cases illustrate that CS may cause LGS in addition to other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies of the neonatal and infantile period. We suggest that generalized tonic or tonic-clonic seizures and generalized slow spike-wave complexes in interictal EEG be included as potential electroclinical features of epilepsy in CS.

"	"CBD was shown to have anti-seizure activity based on in vitro and in vivo models. However, several reports of small series or case reports of the use of cannabis extracts in epilepsy yielded contradictory results and the efficacy of cannabis use in patients with epilepsy have also been inconclusive. In 2013, the first Phase 1 trial for a purified form of CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex; >99% CBD), developed by GW Pharma, showed some efficacy signals and subsequently, a comprehensive program on the efficacy and tolerability of this compound for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies was initiated. Results of these trials led to the FDA and EMA approval respectively in 2018 and 2019 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare epilepsies: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients two years of age and older. Thus, CBD became the first FDA-approved purified drug substance derived from cannabis and also the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of seizures in DS. We detail the clinical studies using purified CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex), including the first open interventional exploratory study and Randomized Control Ttrials for DS and LGS.

"	"EEF1A2 encodes protein elongation factor 1-alpha 2, which is involved in Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. De novo mutations in EEF1A2 have been identified in patients with extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, globe developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability. However, the mechanism underlying phenotype variation is unknown. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified a novel and a recurrent de novo mutation, c.294C>A; p.(Phe98Leu) and c.208G>A; p.(Gly70Ser), in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The further systematic analysis revealed that all EEF1A2 mutations were associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability, suggesting its critical role in neurodevelopment. Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in the t-RNA binding sites or GTP hydrolysis domain were associated with early-onset severe epilepsy, indicating that the clinical expression was potentially determined by the location of mutations and alteration of molecular effects. This study highlights the potential genotype-phenotype relationship in EEF1A2 and facilitates the evaluation of the pathogenicity of EEF1A2 mutations in clinical practice.

"	"Epilepsy is a common disorder in children and adults that causes significant morbidity and affects many aspects of a patient's lives. Two-thirds of patients with epilepsy are controlled with established antiseizure medications, leaving a significant number of patients searching for other options. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advancements in the management of treatment-resistant epilepsy in pediatric patients. Recent publications have shown the efficacy of new pharmaceutical options such as fenfluramine and cannabidiol, some of which have been tested specifically in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes such as Dravet's syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut's syndrome. Furthermore, recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of stiripentol has made available a previously difficult-to-obtain option for patients with Dravet's syndrome. Finally, implanted responsive neurostimulation devices for direct cortical stimulation and deep brain stimulation have shown efficacy in adult patients and may represent a thrilling new horizon for pediatric patients.

32452568	"Does cannabidiol have antiseizure activity independent of its interactions with clobazam? An appraisal of the evidence from randomized controlled trials
"	"Four pivotal randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that adjunctive therapy with cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Between 47% and 68% of patients allocated to CBD treatment in these trials were receiving clobazam (CLB), which shows complex interactions with CBD resulting, in particular, in a 3.4- to 5-fold increase in plasma concentration of the active metabolite norclobazam. This raises concern as to the role played by these interactions in determining the reduction in seizure frequency in CBD-treated patients, and the question of whether CBD per se has clinically evident antiseizure effects. We appraised available evidence on the clinical consequences of the CBD-CLB interaction, focusing on subgroup analyses of seizure outcomes in patients on and off CLB comedication in the pivotal CBD trials, as provided by the European Medicines Agency Public Assessment Report. Evaluation of the results of individual trials clearly showed that improvement in seizure control over placebo was greater when CBD was added on to CLB than when it was added on to other medications. However, seizure control was also improved in patients off CLB, and despite the small sample size the difference vs placebo was statistically significant for the 10 mg/kg/d dose in one of the two LGS trials. Stronger evidence for an antiseizure effect of CBD independent of an interaction with CLB emerges from meta-analyses of seizure outcomes in the pooled population of LGS and DS patients not receiving CLB comedication. Although these results need to be interpreted taking into account methodological limitations, they provide the best clinical evidence to date that CBD exerts therapeutic effects in patients with epilepsy that are independent of its interaction with CLB. Greater antiseizure effects, and a greater burden of adverse effects, are observed when CBD is combined with CLB.

"	"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a rare form of childhood epilepsy. Rufinamide is an orphan drug indicated for the treatment of LGS. Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) is a process in which solid objects are created based on a digital file by adding materials layer by layer. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a 3DP technique with the advantages of solid dispersion systems and the ability to use various pharmaceutical excipients in small scales, which makes this technology favorable for the production of orphan drugs. Rufinamide is a water-insoluble lipophilic compound which can exist in different polymorphic forms. The therapeutic dose is 3200 mg/day, at which rufinamide exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, which may be attributed to its limited solubility. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the dissolution of rufinamide through the use of 3DP technology. For this purpose, optimum 3DP tablets were developed based on 3DP manufacturability and dissolution behaviors. The findings suggest that a mixture of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), Soluplus®, Kollidon® VA64, Gelucire® 48/16 and Triacetin are suitable excipients for FDM-3DP technology that can improve the dissolution of rufinamide. The optimum 3DP tablet shows significantly higher dissolution than Inovelon® at the therapeutic dose due to its improved wdissolution.

"	"For patients with generalized epilepsy who do not respond to antiseizure medications, the therapeutic options are limited. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a treatment mainly approved for therapy-resistant focal epilepsy. There is limited information on the use of VNS on generalized epilepsies, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). We identified patients with a diagnosis of generalized epilepsy (including LGS and GGE), who underwent VNS implantation at the London Health Sciences Centre and Western University, London, Ontario, since this treatment became available in Canada in 1997 until July 2018. We assessed response to the treatment, including admissions to hospital and complications. A total of 46 patients were included in this study with a history of therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy. The mean age at implantation was 24 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 17.8-31 years), significantly younger in the LGS group (p = 0.02) and 50% (n = 23) were female. The most common etiologies were GGE in 37% (n = 17) and LGS in 63% (n = 29). Median follow-up since VNS implantation was 63 months (IQR: 31-112.8 months). Of the LGS group 41.7% (n = 12) of patients had an overall seizure reduction of 50% or more, and 64.7% (n = 11) in the GGE group without statistical significance between the groups. The best response in seizure reduction was seen in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with a significant reduction in the GGE group (p = 0.043). There was a reduction of seizure-related hospital admissions from 91.3% (N = 42) preimplantation, to 43.5% (N = 20) postimplantation (p < 0.05). The frequency of side effects due to the stimulation was almost equal in both groups (62.1% in LGS and 64.7% in GGE). Vagus nerve stimulation should be considered as a treatment in patients with therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy, especially in cases with GGE.

32657695	"Medical cannabis: What practitioners need to know
"	"The South African (SA) Constitutional Court recently decriminalised the private cultivation, possession and use of cannabis by adults. Cannabis contains varying amounts of the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), depending on various cultivation factors. No commercial plant-derived cannabis products are currently registered by the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for medical use. Such products are therefore unregulated, but are freely available in SA, and may be of inadequate quality and unverified composition, and not guaranteed to be safe or effective. SAHPRA has to date approved only one synthetic medical cannabis product, dronabinol. Evidence supporting benefit from medical cannabis exists for two drug-resistant childhood forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Adjuvant therapy with medical cannabis can reduce seizure frequency for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome by 18.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and may be beneficial for other rare forms of epilepsy. There is moderate evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with the synthetic cannabinoids. Multiple sclerosis-associated spasticity showed a small clinical improvement in self-reported spasticity when a purified form of THC/CBD was added to existing therapy. Currently, low-level or no convincing evidence exists for the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain, sleep and weight disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Cannabis is associated with a greater risk of adverse effects than active and placebo controls, and may be involved in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. The evolving regulatory and legal landscape on the use of medical cannabis will guide prescription and recreational use in the coming years.

"	"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a noninvasive technique for division of the corpus callosum, which can confer improved seizure control to patients suffering from frequent atonic seizures due to rapid interhemispheric generalization. This noninvasive approach is well-suited for use in a palliative intervention for improved seizure control in this patient population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of radiosurgical completion corpus callosotomy in an adult in the United States. A 20-year-old ambidextrous nonverbal man with a history of refractory generalized epilepsy status post open anterior corpus callosotomy at age 10 years, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and autism presented after 2 years of incremental, progressive deterioration in seizure control and behavior including 1 year. The family decided to pursue SRS corpus callosotomy. Under general anesthesia, a volume of interest encompassing a full midsagittal plane of the corpus callosum was defined to deliver 60 Gy to the 50% isodose line fully encompassing the target. Gamma Knife was used with 2 isocenters at 90° and 1 at 110° and isodose lines of 60, 20, and 12 Gy. Treatment was carried out without difficulty or complications while the patient remained under close monitoring. The patient was discharged the next day with a 2-week taper of dexamethasone. Eight months postradiosurgical corpus callosotomy, the patient is free of atonic seizures and is ambulatory. In carefully selected cases and with protective radiosurgical planning, SRS for completion corpus callosotomy represents an effective option for refractory seizure control.

We aimed to obtain knowledge about clinical experience and attitudes toward cannabinoid use for epilepsy treatment among neuropediatricians in Scandinavia and Germany in the era before a CBD-product was commercially licensed and available. Study design: An internet-based questionnaire (Survey Monkey) was distributed by email to members of neuropediatric societies in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Norway between February and April 2018. One reminder email was sent. Results: Eighty-six responded. Only 10 of 86 (12%) respondents had personal experience with off-label prescription of cannabinoid-based products, mainly for severe refractory pediatric epilepsies like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, 49 respondents (57%) had been exposed to relatives of patients that had requested or wanted to discuss cannabinoid therapy, and 32 (37%) respondents knew about cannabinoid self-medication. The knowledge regarding cannabinoid-based therapy among the respondents was overall limited. Main reasons for not prescribing cannabinoid-based therapy were concerns about law regulations and lack of an available product. Conclusion: Off-label cannabinoid-based therapy for pediatric epilepsy was not widely prescribed by neuropediatricians in Scandinavia and Germany in 2018.

"	"Lung donation after circulatory death (DCD) has proved to be an effective strategy for expanding the donor pool, but is still considered challenging. We report a successful case of lung procurement from an extended-criteria uncontrolled DCD. We evaluated the lungs of an uncontrolled DCD from a hospital without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. The donor was a non-smoker 20-year old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, cardiocirculatory arrests, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Cardiac arrest occurred in a swimming pool, and bronchoscopy showed signs of inhalation. We employed our usual normothermic in-situ open-ventilated lung approach. After retrieval, lungs were stored on ice, then evaluated with ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and judged suitable for transplantation. The recipient was a 26-year old female with cystic fibrosis on long-term oxygen therapy, on the waitlist for up to 21 months due to her anthropomorphic characteristics. She required central VA-ECMO support during bilateral lung transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) within the first 72 h reached grade 3; post-operative peripheral VV-ECMO support was discontinued two days after surgery. The patient was discharged 28 days after surgery; she is alive two years after transplantation with no signs of rejection nor anastomotic complications. Despite the spreading use of lungs from controlled DCD, perplexities remain on uncontrolled DCD, namely: severe PDG, postoperative mortality, airway complications. Our case report suggests that good results can be achieved with uncontrolled DCD despite the presence of relative contraindications: inhalation of water, prolonged ischemic times and recipient in poor conditions.

To identify the safety and efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation in children with intractable epilepsy and analyze the effects on different epilepsy syndromes. Eligible children with intractable epilepsy were admitted to the study. We collected data from preoperative assessments as the baseline. During the follow-up time, we recorded the process of seizures (frequency, duration, and seizure type), the changes of drugs or parameters, the complications, etc. The mean reduction rate of seizures, response rate, and McHugh scale were chosen as the outcomes. A total of 213 patients were implanted with Tsinghua Pins vagus nerve stimulators, and the average age was 6.6 years. In the follow-up time of postoperative 3 mo, 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo, the average reduction rate was 30.2%, 49.5%, 56.3%, 59.4%, and 63.2%, while the response rate was 21.8%, 62.5%, 57.1%, 69.2%, and 70.7%. In addition, implanted vagus nerve stimulation had different effects on epilepsy syndromes. The reduction rate of West syndrome increased from 36.4% (postoperative 6 m) to 74.3% (postoperative 24 m). The reduction rate of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome improved from 25.4% to 73.1% in 24 mo. The chi-square test of the five efficacy grades showed P < 0.05.

"	"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are severe seizure disorders that occur in infants and young children, characterized by developmental delay, cognitive decline, and early mortality. Recent efforts have identified a wide variety of genetic variants that cause DEEs. Among these, variants in the DNM1 gene have emerged as definitive causes of DEEs, including infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A mouse model of Dnm1-associated DEE, known as ""Fitful"" (Dnm1Ftfl ), recapitulates key features of the disease, including spontaneous seizures, early lethality, and neuronal degeneration. Previous work showed that DNM1 is a key regulator of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis and synaptic transmission and suggested that inhibitory neurotransmission may be more reliant on DNM1 function than excitatory transmission. The Dnm1Ftfl variant is thought to encode a dominant negative DNM1 protein; however, the effects of the Dnm1Ftfl variant on synaptic transmission are largely unknown. To understand these synaptic effects, we recorded from pairs of cultured mouse cortical neurons and characterized all four major connection types [excitation of excitation (E-E), inhibition of inhibition (I-I), E-I, I-E]. Miniature and spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were larger, but less frequent, at all Dnm1Ftfl synaptic types, and Dnm1Ftfl neurons had reduced expression of excitatory and inhibitory SV markers. Baseline evoked transmission, however, was reduced only at inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons, because of a smaller pool of releasable SVs. In addition to these synaptic alterations, Dnm1Ftfl neurons degenerated later in development, although their activity levels were reduced, suggesting that Dnm1Ftfl may impair synaptic transmission and neuronal health through distinct mechanisms.

Adverse events were reported in 36.3% of total patients of which most common adverse events were gastrointestinal problems. However, no life-threatening adverse event was reported in both LGS and DS during the observation period. In this first Korean study, CBD was safe and tolerable for use and could be expected to potentially reduce the seizure frequency in pediatric patients with LGS or DS.

Additional data including patient and tumor characteristics, treatment course, tolerability, AEDs used prior to addition of clobazam, and AEDs concomitantly used with clobazam were collected. A total of 35 patients with TRE on clobazam were identified, with 2 patients unable to tolerate the medication due to side effects. Of the 33 remaining patients, a total of 31 (93.9%) of patients were deemed responders. Ten patients (30.3%) were seizure free within 6 months of clobazam initiation and 21 (63.6%) reported a significant reduction in seizure frequency. This reduction also allowed several patients to modify concurrent AEDs. Clobazam is an effective agent to use as add-on AED in TRE, with 94% of patients showing a significant response within 6 months. Furthermore, the addition of clobazam may yield a reduction in polypharmacy, as concomitant AEDs can be reduced and potentially withdrawn.

"	"We aim to describe the long term follow-up of a cohort of children exposed in utero to the Zika virus. Descriptive study of a cohort of microcephalic children due to Zika virus. Logistic regression was used to evaluate variables associated with worse prognosis epilepsy. We followed 28 children (15 females), with a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR = 12-28). During the follow-up, 1 infant died. The median head circumference at birth was 29 cm (IQR = 27-31). All presented a global developmental delay. The most frequent central nervous system abnormalities were on cortical development in 22 participants; dysgenesis of corpus callosum in 13; ventriculomegaly in 25; and calcifications in 24. A total of 9 presented ocular abnormalities, 4 auditory impairment. During follow-up, 12 presented with sleep disorders, 10 with irritability, and 23 with epilepsy (2 with generalized tonic-clonic, 3 with generalized tonic-clonic and spasms, 12 with spasms, 3 tonic and spasms, and 3 motor focal and spasms). The median age at the begin of the epilepsy was 4 months (IQR = 2-10), the median number of drugs used to control the epilepsy was 2 (IQR = 2-3). Maternal illicit drug use during pregnancy was associated with worse prognosis epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome, or status epilepticus). A total of 19 presented with dysphagia, 10 children required gastrostomy. Children with microcephaly due to Zika virus presented with several complications during follow-up, as epilepsy, spastic diplegia, and global developmental delay.

33693596	"Consciousness among delta waves: a paradox?
"	"A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the appearance of delta (1 - 4 Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high amplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are very frequently observed in states of diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalised epileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness such as coma and vegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high amplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical deactivation that occurs during the ""down states"" or troughs of these slow oscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of prominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the hypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of unconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, behavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful psychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely unacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients with high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a largely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the complexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalogram or MEG signals strongly relates to an individual's level of consciousness. Having reviewed this literature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming contradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We also consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we conclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by examining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral power.

33764203	"Evolution of Infantile Spasms to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: What Is There to Know?
"	"Children with infantile spasms may develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are vague, and many experts use varying combinations of the following criteria for diagnosis: paroxysmal fast activity on electroencephalography (EEG), slow spike and wave on EEG, developmental delay, multiple seizure types, and nocturnal tonic seizures. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a high-risk cohort of children with a history of infantile spasms and the characteristics of infantile spasms that were associated with the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Children with infantile spasms who were diagnosed and treated at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2012 and 2018 were included. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was defined as having 3 of 5 of the following characteristics: paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike and wave, current developmental delay, multiple seizure types, or tonic seizures. Descriptive statistics were performed using median and interquartile range. Univariable analysis was performed with Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Ninety-seven children met inclusion criteria, and 36% (35/97) met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Developmental delay and history of seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms were identified as risk factors for the development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .003) as was poor response to first treatment for spasms (P = .004). Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .019). Eighty percent (28/35) of the children who met Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria lacked a documented diagnosis. Thirty-six percent of children with infantile spasms met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Risk factors for development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were developmental delay and seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms and poor response to first treatment for infantile spasms. Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eighty percent of the children who met our criteria were not given a documented diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which highlights the fact that many children may not be receiving a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We recommend establishing clear guidelines for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to ensure that the diagnosis is being made accurately.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease and the severity of the disease related with genetic analysis has been described in some previous studies. The main aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with genetically diagnosed PCD and to investigate the correlation between clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings and genetic analyses of these patients. This is a cohort study in which we analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and genetic results of 46 patients with genetically diagnosed PCD through whole-exome sequencing at our single center from a total of 265 patients with PCD within a 5-year period. Genetic analysis revealed pathogenic variants in DNAH5 (n = 12 individuals, 12 families), CCDC40 (n = 9 individuals, six families), RSPH4A (n = 5 individuals, three families), DNAH11 (n = 4 individuals, four families), HYDIN (n = 5 individuals, five families), CCNO (n = 4 individuals, four families), DNAI1 (n = 2 individuals, one family), ARMC4 (n = 2 individuals, two families), TTC25 (n = 1), DNAH1 (n = 1), and CCDC39 (n = 1) genes. Although not statistically significant, the age at diagnosis was lower (median: 3 years; range, 6 months-4 years) in patients with CCNO pathogenic variants due to the early reporting of symptoms, and the median body mass index (BMI) and BMI z scores were lower in patients at 18.7 and 16 kg/m2 , and -0.78 and -1.2 with CCDC40 and CCNO pathogenic variants, respectively. The median forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75% were 53%, 64%, and 28%, respectively; these parameters were also lower in the CCDC40 group than in the other groups. There was no significant correlation between the genetic results and symptoms, radiologic findings, and microbiologic data of patients with PCD. In PCD, there was significant heterogeneity of lung disease, patients who had pathogenic variants in CCNO presented earlier, and those with CCDC40 and CCNO had worse lung disease, and poorer nutritional status compared with the other subgroups. We hope that whole genotype-phenotype and clinical relationships will be identified in PCD.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, respiratory distress in term neonates, laterality (situs) defects, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities seen by electron microscopy. Mutations in radial spoke head proteins occur in PCD patients with central apparatus defects. Advances in genetic testing have been crucial in addressing the diagnostic challenge. Here, we describe a novel splice-site mutation (c.921+3_6delAAGT) in RSPH4A, which leads to a premature translation termination signal in nine subjects with PCD (seven families). Loss-of-function was confirmed with quantitative ciliary ultrastructural analysis, measurement of ciliary beat frequency and waveform, and transcript analysis. All nine individuals carrying c.921+3_6delAAGT splice-site mutation in RSPH4A were Hispanic with ancestry tracing to Puerto Rico. This mutation is a founder mutation and a common cause of PCD without situs abnormalities in patients of Puerto Rican descent.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetic disorder featured with dysfunctional motility of cilia. Clinical presentations of PCD include situs inversus, repeated respiratory tract infections, otitis media, sinusitis and infertility. This study aims to provide clinical strategies on diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Clinical data of seven patients diagnosed as PCD in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were analyzed. We also extracted data from other cases in mainland China from the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database by the end of 2012. A total of 127 cases of PCD were summarized and analyzed in this study. Seven patients in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were finally confirmed to have PCD. All of them had clinical history of recurrent respiratory infection. Imaging analysis showed varying degrees of bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests in four patients showed combined obstructive and restrictive patterns. Three cases were confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy. We then further extracted information from literature for those 127 PCD patients in mainland China. All of them had chronic respiratory infection. Seven cases were complicated with recurrent otitis media and 15 cases were complicated with infertility. A total of 119 patients were diagnosed with situs inversus totalis (94%). Among those 127 patients, only 9 patients' diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy. Four patients received sinus resection, and one patient received pulmonary lobectomy due to recurrent hemoptysis. One patient died of massive hemoptysis. Being a rare disease and easily confused with uncomplicated bronchiectasis, PCD diagnosis warrants particular attention. Recurrent respiratory infection, especially situs inversus could be the most important indicator of this disease.

"	"Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by severe early onset periodontitis and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. A previously reported missense mutation in the CTSC gene (NM\_001814.4:c.899G>A:p.(G300D)) was identified in a homozygous state in two siblings diagnosed with PLS in a consanguineous family of Arabic ancestry. The variant was initially identified in a heterozygous state in a PLS unaffected sibling whose whole exome had been sequenced as part of a previous Primary ciliary dyskinesia study. Using this information, a proxy molecular diagnosis was made on the PLS affected siblings after consent was given to study this second disorder found to be segregating within the family. The prevalence of the mutation was then assayed in the local population using a representative sample of 256 unrelated individuals. The variant was absent in all subjects indicating that the variant is rare in Saudi Arabia. This family study illustrates how whole-exome sequencing can generate findings and inferences beyond its primary goal.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare recessive disease with a prevalence of 1/10,000; its symptoms are caused by a kinetic dysfunction of motile cilia in the respiratory epithelium, flagella in spermatozoids, and primary cilia in the embryonic node. PCD is genetically heterogeneous: genotyping the already known PCD-related genes explains the genetic basis in 60-65% of the cases, depending on the population. While identification of new genes involved in PCD pathogenesis remains crucial, the search for new, population-specific mutations causative for PCD is equally important. The Slavs remain far less characterized in this respect compared to West European populations, which significantly limits diagnostic capability. The main goal of this study was to characterize the profile of causative genetic defects in one of the PCD-causing genes, ZMYND10, in the cohort of PCD patients of Slavic origin. The study was carried out using biological material from 172 unrelated PCD individuals of Polish origin, with no causative mutation found in nine major PCD genes. While none of the previously described mutations was found using the HRM-based screening, a novel frameshift mutation (c.367delC) in ZMYND10, unique for Slavic PCD population, was found in homozygous state in two unrelated PCD patients. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms from the ciliary axoneme, consistent with the already published ZMYND10-mutated phenotype; cDNA analysis revealed the lack of ZMYND10 mRNA, indicating nonsense-mediated decay of the truncated transcript.

A national multicenter study from 2012 to 2013 recruited patients diagnosed or suspected of having PCD. Diagnosis was verified using: nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO); High-speed Video Microscope Analysis (HVMA); Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of cilia; Immuno-fluorescence staining (IF) for ciliary proteins, and genetic analysis. Of the 203 patients recruited from 14 pediatric centers, 150 had a PCD diagnosis verified. Median age was 15.05y, with range 0.15-60.5y. PCD prevalence was 1:54,000 for the general population and 1:25,000 in children (5-14 y). For the non-Jewish (mainly Druze and Arab Moslem) compared to Jewish populations, prevalence was 1:16,500 and 1:139,000 respectively (p < 0.0001) and parental consanguinity was 85.4% and 21.9% respectively (p < 0.0001). Clinical features included bronchiectasis (88%), rhinitis (81%), recurrent pneumonia (78%), recurrent otitis (62%), neonatal pneumonia (60%) and situs inversus (42%). Prior diagnostic practices varied widely between centers with TEM assessed in 55% and abnormal in 61% of these. Management included antibiotics and airway clearance. Diagnostic verification revealed for 150 PCD patients: 81% nNO<233 ppb, 62% abnormal HVMA, 51% diagnostic TEM, 58% diagnostic IF and, 57% genetic diagnosis. PCD in Israel is rare, with comprehensive diagnostic tests showing prevalence in children similar to Europe. Prevalence was higher in non-Jews, associated with parental consanguinity. Diagnostic and management practices vary. Referral centers providing comprehensive diagnostic and care capabilities should be established.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by functional impairment of cilia throughout the body. The early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long-term sequelae; however, this is often challenging because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD and difficulty in genetic analysis. The majority of PCD patients in Japan are not diagnosed properly. To diagnose PCD more accurately, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. We examined 46 patients (age range, 1-64 years; 23 male and 23 female) who were clinically suspected of PCD. First, mutation hotspots in DNAH5 and DNAI1 were sequenced by the Sanger method. Next, exome sequencing was performed in 32 known PCD genes using our novel NGS panel with the Ion Torrent PGM system. Variant annotation was generated by Ion Reporter Version 5.0 (Life Technologies). Mutations found in the panel were validated by Sanger sequencing. Disease-causing gene mutations were found in 10 patients from 7 families: DNAH5 in 4 families, and DNAI1, CCDC40, and RSPH4A in 1 family each. Heterozygous mutations were found in 1 patient. The majority of the mutations found in the present analysis were novel. Japanese PCD patients have novel mutations in cilia-related genes. This targeted NGS panel can identify disease-causing mutations in patients with PCD.

He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, hereditary, multiorgan disease caused by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia. It results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly in the upper and lower airways. Central data collection in national and international registries is essential to studying the epidemiology of rare diseases and filling in gaps in knowledge of diseases such as PCD. For this reason, the Swiss Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Registry (CH-PCD) was founded in 2013 as a collaborative project between epidemiologists and adult and paediatric pulmonologists. We describe the objectives and methodology of the CH-PCD, present initial results, and give an overview of current and ongoing projects.  The registry records patients of any age, suffering from PCD, who are treated and resident in Switzerland. It collects information from patients identified through physicians, diagnostic facilities and patient organisations. The registry dataset contains data on diagnostic evaluations, lung function, microbiology and imaging, symptoms, treatments and hospitalisations.  By May 2018, CH-PCD has contacted 566 physicians of different specialties and identified 134 patients with PCD. At present, this number represents an overall 1 in 63,000 prevalence of people diagnosed with PCD in Switzerland. Prevalence differs by age and region; it is highest in children and adults younger than 30 years, and in Espace Mittelland. The median age of patients in the registry is 25 years (range 5–73), and 41 patients have a definite PCD diagnosis based on recent international guidelines. Data from CH-PCD are contributed to international collaborative studies and the registry facilitates patient identification for nested studies.  CH-PCD has proven to be a valuable research tool that already has highlighted weaknesses in PCD clinical practice in Switzerland.    Trial registration number: NCT03606200

"	"Reduced or no progressive sperm motility in the fresh ejaculate defines asthenozoospermia as one of the major causes of male infertility. The axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene encodes for one of the axonemal dynein heavy chain (DHC) family members and participates in assembling respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. Given the high degree of conservation of DNAH11, mutations could give rise to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and asthenozoospermia. To date, few studies have reported on the association between variants in DNAH11 and asthenozoospermia. In the present study, 87 patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia for variants in DNAH11 were screened by using high-throughput targeted gene sequencing technology. Bioinformatics analysis was further assessed. We found compound heterozygous variants (c.9484-1 G>T, c.12428 T>C) of DNAH11 detected in 1 of 87 patients. The variant c.9484-1 G>T was confirmed as a novel virulence variant which was predicted to affect splicing by Human Splicing Finder 3.1. And c.12428 T>C was predicted to be mildly pathogenic in silico analysis. We found that DNAH11 polymorphisms display strong associations with asthenozoospermia, and may contribute to an increased risk of male infertility in Chinese patients.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder. Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] ≥ 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.

In this study, we aim at confirming the clinical diagnosis and explore the genetic spectrum of PCD in a cohort of Tunisian patients. Forty clinically diagnosed patients with PCD belonging to 34 families were recruited from Tunisian pediatric departments. In each proband, targeted capture PCD panel sequencing of the 40 PCD genes was performed. PCD panel sequencing identified bi-allelic mutations in 82% of the families in eight PCD genes. Remarkably, 23.5% of patients carried the same c.2190del CCDC39 mutation. Single nucleotide polymorphism profiling in six unrelated patients carrying this mutation has revealed a founder effect in North-African patients. This mutation is estimated to date back at least 1,400-1,750 years ago. The identification of this major allele allowed us to suggest a cost-effective genetic diagnostic strategy in North-African patients with PCD.

"	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder of motile cilia dysfunction generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Genetic testing is increasingly considered an early step in the PCD diagnostic workflow. We used targeted panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) for genetic screening of 33 Egyptian families with clinically highly suspected PCD. All variants prioritized were Sanger confirmed in the affected individuals and correctly segregated within the family. Targeted NGS yielded a high diagnostic output (70%) with biallelic mutations identified in known PCD genes. Mutations were identified in 13 genes overall, with CCDC40 and CCDC39 the most frequently mutated genes among Egyptian patients. Most identified mutations were predicted null effect variants (79%) and not reported before (85%). This study reveals that the genetic landscape of PCD among Egyptians is highly heterogeneous, indicating that a targeted NGS approach covering multiple genes will provide a superior diagnostic yield compared to Sanger sequencing for genetic diagnosis. The high diagnostic output achieved here highlights the potential of placing genetic testing early within the diagnostic workflow for PCD, in particular in developing countries where other diagnostic tests can be less available.

The involvement of copy number variation (CNV) in the development of PCD is largely unknown. We examined 93 Japanese patients with clinically suspected PCD from 84 unrelated families. CNV was examined either by exome sequencing of a PCD gene panel or by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The identified alterations were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Nasal ciliary ultrastructure was examined by electron microscopy. Analysis of CNV by the panel or WES revealed a biallelic deletion in the dynein regulatory complex subunit 1 (DRC1) gene in 21 patients, which accounted for 49% of the PCD patients in whom a disease-causing gene was found. Sanger sequencing of the PCR product revealed a 27,748-bp biallelic deletion including exons 1-4 of DRC1 with identical breakpoints in all 21 patients. The ciliary ultrastructure of the patients with this CNV showed axonemal disorganization and the loss or gain of central microtubules. The deletion of DRC1 is the major cause of PCD in Japan and this alteration can cause various ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities.

"	"To aid in the diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and to evaluate the respiratory epithelium in respiratory disease, normal age-related reference ranges are needed for ciliary beat frequency (CBF), beat pattern and ultrastructure. Our aim was to establish reference ranges for healthy Chinese children. Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 135 healthy Chinese children aged below 18 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. CBF and beat pattern were analysed from high speed video recordings. Epithelial integrity and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed using transmission electronic microscopy. The mean CBF from 135 children studied was 10.1 Hz (95% CI 9.8 to 10.4). Approximately 20% (ranged 18.0-24.2%) of ciliated epithelial edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. Normal beat pattern was observed in ciliated epithelium from all subjects. We did not find any effect of exposure to second hand smoke on CBF in our subjects. Microtubular defects were found in 9.3% of all of the cilia counted in these children, while other ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 3%. We established the reference range for CBF, beat pattern and ultrastructure in healthy Chinese children. Using similar methodology, we found a lower overall mean CBF than previously obtained European values. This study highlights the need to establish normative data for ciliary function in different populations.

"	"Arteriovenous malformations may lead to right-heart failure in cases of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two rare AV-malformations with left-to-right shunting and progressive right-heart failure in a single individual.

20414677	"Update on molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disease hallmarked by the development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Germline mutations in two genes, endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ACVRL1), have been implicated in this disease. This report describes molecular diagnosis in a consecutive series of 600 individuals with clinical features of HHT disease. Each coding exon and flanking intronic regions of ENG and ACVRL1 genes was sequenced. Exonic copy number was quantified in probands without a coding sequence mutation. Novel nonsynonymous variants were further analyzed to predict functional consequences. In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and haplotypes for the two genes were compared between individuals with and without mutations. The highest mutation detection rate (87% [95% CI 80.2-91.5]) was observed in probands who met all four Curacao criteria (epistaxis, telangiectases, AVMs and family history). More than 30% of identified mutations were novel; however, only 6% were variants of unknown significance. Determining the significance of novel mutations as related to disease presents additional challenges. Detection of multiple alterations in the same proband also requires careful evaluation for disease association. In conclusion, the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands in this group do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of these two genes. This suggests alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation or involvement of alternate loci, and it requires further investigation.

"	"Brain abscesses occur in 5 to 13 % of patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), more often present in Rendu-Osler-Weber disease or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of **headache** for 2 months before **acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever.** CT-scan and **MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion.** **A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved.** CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after **coil embolization.** He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A **second embolization** was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke.

"	"Primary lung tumors in children are rare. A wide range of histopathologic tumor types occurs. The incidence of these lesions and their outcomes are still largely unknown. **This study aims to determine the incidence of different primary lung tumors in children and to contribute data leading to the development of evidence-based treatment models. **A single institution retrospective **review** was performed with institutional review board approval. Patients were included if they had primary, nonhematologic lung tumors. Simple squamous papillomas subjected to endoscopic biopsy and not resected, and vascular lesions associated with multisystem lesions, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, were excluded. Medical records and pathologic material for patients from 1918 to 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients were identified (23 boys, 17 girls) with a mean age of 9.6 years (range, 3 months to 19 years). Fourteen distinct** histopathologic tumor** types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. **Chemotherapy** was used in 23% (9) and **radiation** in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.

21290179	"Natural history and outcome of hepatic vascular malformations in a large cohort of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia.
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disease characterized by teleangiectasias involving virtually every organ. There are limited data in the literature regarding the natural history of liver vascular malformations in hemorrhagic telangiectasia and their associated morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study sought to assess the outcome of liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients. We analyzed 16 years of surveillance data from a tertiary hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center in Italy. We considered for inclusion in this study 502 consecutive Italian patients at risk of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who presented at the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center and underwent a multidisciplinary screening protocol for the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Of the 502 individuals assessed in the center, 154 had hepatic vascular malformations and were the subject of the study; 198 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and without hepatic vascular malformations were the controls. Additionally, we report the response to treatment of patients with complicated hepatic vascular malformations. The 154 patients were included and followed for a median period of 44 months (range 12-181); of these, eight (5.2%) died from VM-related complications and 39 (25.3%) experienced complications. The average incidence rates of death and complications were 1.1 and 3.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. The median overall survival and event-free survival after diagnosis were 175 and 90 months, respectively. The rate of complete response to therapy was 63%. This study shows that substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with liver vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients.

"	"Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are at risk for multiple complications and require close follow-up. We investigated the reproducibility of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and exercise stress test (EST) for the evaluation of low oxygen saturation in patients with PAVMs. Twenty-two patients with PAVMs, most of whom had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), participated in a Human Investigations Committee-approved protocol. Patients ranged from 9 to 74 years of age (mean 28) and had a broad spectrum of anatomic subtypes of PAVMs, including focal and diffuse. Standard 6MWT and cycle ergometry EST were both performed twice with adequate rest between tests. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were measured at the beginning and end of each test. Distance walked and maximum resistance was also recorded. The intraclass correlation coefficients (r(i)) at the end of 6MWT were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.940; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.973; 95% CI 0.933-0.989), and distance (r(i) = 0.942; 95% CI 0.867-0.975). The r(i)s at the end of EST were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.865-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.993; 95% CI 0.982-0.997), and maximum resistance (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.864-0.975). 6MWT and EST were reproducible measures of exercise capacity and oxygen saturation and are potential adjunct tests in the follow-up assessment for patients with PAVMs.

"	"Intranasal Bevacizumab is an effective therapy for epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Retrospective chart review. In 32 successive patients presenting with recurrent HHT epistaxis 25-100 mg of Bevacizumab was applied intranasally either as a submucosal injection or as a topical spray between November 2008 and May 2010. In many of the injected patients, the Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment efficacy. All 32 treated patients were contacted with pre- and posttreatment epistaxis severity scores (ESS) compared. Seventeen patients received topical Bevacizumab, 10 patients received a submucosal injection, and 5 patients received both. In addition, 12 patients were also treated with the KTP laser at the time of their submucosal injection. In the pretreatment period the average ESS was 7.0 (SD = 2.1), whereas in the posttreatment group the average ESS was 2.9 (SD = 1.7). This represents a significant improvement in epistaxis severity (P < .0001). In HHT patients intranasal Bevacizumab, applied as a topical spray or a submucosal injection, significantly improves epistaxis as measured by the Epistaxis Severity Score.

"	"Pediatric pial arteriovenous fistulae (pAVF) are rare vascular lesions of the CNS, reported to have up to a 25% association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The presentation, treatment and syndromes associated with pAVF in children are reported here. A pediatric database for pAVF was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%). Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh. Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.

"	"In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations frequently lead to complications. In a case of pleural effusion in a patient with known pulmonary arterio-venous malformations, the first diagnosis to consider is a hemothorax even though alternatives such as empyema are possible. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with bilateral arteriovenous malformations, who was admitted to the emergency department with subacute dyspnoea and left thoracic pain. The clinical examination suggested a hemothorax. Pulmonary angiography was performed and showed an arteriovenous malformation in the left lower lobe. Embolisation was undertaken and at the same time a chest tube was inserted. Pus was evacuated leading to the final diagnosis of pleural empyema. Progress was good despite an episode acute respiratory distress due to a pulmonary embolism. Pleural empyema is rarely described in the context of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. In the case of pleural effusion this diagnosis should be considered even though hemothorax is more common.

22281938	"Cost savings through molecular diagnosis for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular development resulting in direct connections between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing capillaries. Symptoms and signs can appear throughout life and marked intrafamilial variability confounds diagnosis based purely on clinical criteria. We set out to determine the impact of genetic testing on the cost of screening for HHT in at-risk relatives. We performed economic modeling of idealized pedigrees following two scenarios: repeated clinical screening until an HHT diagnosis could be either affirmed or excluded, and mutation testing in the proband, followed by genetic testing of at-risk relatives and clinical monitoring of only those relatives who test positive for the familial mutation. Based on actual reimbursement data from our region's largest health insurer, the molecular diagnostic model saved over $22,000 for a family with four relatives at risk for the initial diagnostic work-up. For a cohort of 100 probands, the total savings for the molecular diagnostic model over a reasonable period of follow-up was greater than $9 million. In this idealized setting in which all probands and at-risk relatives accepted molecular testing, the economic advantages of genetic screening over repeated clinical screening are substantial.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes. A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.

"	"Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited disease that occurs in approximately one in 5000 to 8000 people. Clinical diagnosis of HHT is made when a person presents three of the following four criteria: family history, recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. **We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. **Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. **The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years. A genetic study revealed a mutation in exon 3 of ALK1 (c.199C > T; p.Arg67Trp) in the proband and his eldest son presenting epistaxis.

We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with decompensated right-sided heart failure secondary to newly diagnosed PAH. The clinical diagnosis of HHT was confirmed on the basis of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple typical mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. There was also a suggestive family history. The patient was discovered to have active and extensive stimulant abuse in addition to HHT. We concluded that there may be a temporal relationship between exposure to stimulants and development of PAH in a host with underlying gene mutation.

Ultrasound examinations showed splenomegaly as well as portal hypertension. Blood examinations revealed low levels of haemoglobin**. CT imaging showed multiple arteriovenous malformations with arterioportal shunts within the liver which led to a volume-induced portal hypertension. The genetic analysis revealed no mutations in the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 or endoglin genes. The patient was clinically diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Because of the multiple arterioportal shunts within the liver and the resulting portal hypertension with live-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, the only therapeutic option for the patient is liver transplantation. Therefore, an application for a standard exception was made at Eurotransplant and the patient is going to be liver transplantated within the next months. Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease which leads to arteriovenous malformations and which can affect different organ systems. The course of the disease can be rather benign, but it can also lead to live-threatening complications requiring fast interventions.

Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded.

We reviewed records of 171 patients with HHT and brain AVMs. A history of ICH was found in 27% (41/152) patients, with a mean age of 26 ± 18 range, (0-68) years. All of patients with ICH were neurologically asymptomatic prior to ICH. Multiple brain AVMs were found in 23% (170/39) of patients on initial examination. Genetic test results were available in 109 (64%) patients. Mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 were present in 75 (69%), 18 (17%), and 2 (2%), respectively. A history of ICH was reported in 24% of patients with an ENG mutation and 27% of patients with an ACVRL1 mutation, with a mean age of 26 ± 16 (range, 2-50) and 18 ± 21 (0-48) years, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age at first brain AVM diagnosis, prevalence of ICH history, age at ICH, or other manifestations of brain AVMs were observed among gene groups. In conclusion, no evidence for differences in brain AVM characteristics was observed among HHT gene groups, although we cannot exclude clinically important differences. Larger studies are needed to further guide brain AVM screening decisions in patients with HHT.

"	"A 47-year-old man was found to have abnormal findings on chest radiography. Chest computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that he had a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. He had experienced epistaxis when he was a junior high school student, and since then, the symptom had frequently recurred. Further, he had telangiectasia on the lips. Thus, he was given a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Endoscopy revealed gastric telangiectasia, and in addition, his colon had many juvenile polyps. When he was 49 years of age, he underwent genetic analysis for HHT. A diagnosis of juvenile polyposis-HHT combined syndrome (JP-HHT) was made since a heterozygous germline 4-base deletion in exon 9 of SMAD4 was detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of JP-HHT associated with SMAD4 mutation in Japan.

An 11-year-old Croatian boy of Mediterranean origin with a history of asthma since childhood was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of difficult-to-control asthma during the previous six months. A chest X-ray showed a homogeneous soft tissue mass in the lingual area. Computed tomography angiography of the thorax showed two pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, one on each side of the lungs. Diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was made clinically by Curaçao criteria. Genetic analysis revealed a mutation in the endoglin gene. The patient was treated with embolotherapy with good clinical outcome. We present a case of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations masquerading as refractory asthma.

23401183	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: how accurate are the clinical criteria?
"	"The clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is based on the Curaçao criteria. Three out of four criteria are required for a definite clinical diagnosis HHT, two criteria are considered ""possible"" HHT, and 0 or 1 criterion makes the diagnosis unlikely. However, these consensus diagnostic criteria have not been validated. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical criteria. A total of 450 consecutive persons ≥16 years of age were screened for HHT between May 2004 and September 2009, including a chest CT to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We selected 263 first-degree relatives of disease-causing mutation carriers who underwent mutation analysis. Genetic test results were considered the gold standard. The family mutation was present in 186 patients (mean age 42.9 ± 14.6 yr; 54.8% female). A clinical diagnosis was definite, ""possible"", and unlikely in 168 (90.3%), 17 (9.1%), and 1 (0.5%) patient, respectively. In 77 persons the family mutation was absent (mean age 37.1 ± 12.3 yr, 59.7% female). In this group a clinical diagnosis was definite, possible, and unlikely in 0, 35 (45.5%), and 42 (54.5%) persons, respectively. The positive predictive value of a definite clinical diagnosis was 100% (95% CI 97.8-100), the negative predictive value of an unlikely diagnosis 97.7% (95% CI 87.9-99.6). Of 52 patients with ""possible"" HHT, 17 (32.7%) displayed an HHT-causing mutation. The Curaçao clinical criteria have a good diagnostic performance. Genetic testing is particularly helpful in patients with a ""possible"" clinical diagnosis HHT.

"	"Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.

"	"To assess the safety and efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency (RF) treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with mild or moderate epistaxis. We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.

"	"Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and hepatopulmonary syndrome are disorders characterized by the development of multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM). COX2 may be at the origin of a cascade of pro inflammatory events to favour angiogenesis and PAVM development. HHT and hepatopulmonary syndrome mouse models may be used to show its effects on PAVM formation. Anti COX-2 therapy could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a hepatopulmonary syndrome or HHT with small PAVM. PAVMs are one of the main causes of morbidity in patients presenting with HHT disease, owing to the risks of rupture as well as paradoxical embolism exposing to stroke and/or cerebral abscess. Percutaneous embolization has become the treatment of choice of PAVM. Anti COX2 may prevent from PAVM development and subsequent related complications and avoid either surgery and/or percutaneous embolization and thus subsequent related complication.

Speckle variance optical coherence tomography exploits the large variance values of intensity changes in time caused mainly by the random backscattering of light resulting from translational activity of red blood cells to map out the microvascular networks. A method to map out the microvasculature malformation of skin based on the time-domain histograms of individual pixels is presented with results obtained from both normal skin and skin containing vascular malformation. Results demonstrated that this method can potentially map out deeper blood vessels and enhance the visualization of microvasculature in low signal regions, while being resistant against motion (e.g., patient tremor or internal reflex movements). The overall results are manifested as more uniform en face projection maps of microvessels. Potential applications include clinical imaging of skin vascular abnormalities and wide-field skin angiography for the study of complex vascular networks.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by vascular malformations (VMs) and caused by mutations in TGFβ/BMP9 pathway genes, most commonly ENG or ACVRL1. Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype. These results suggest that common polymorphisms in HHT genes other than the mutated gene modulate phenotype severity of HHT disease, specifically presence of organ VM.

The diagnosis of HHT patients currently remains at the clinical level, according to the ""Curaçao criteria,"" whereas the molecular diagnosis is used to confirm or rule out suspected HHT cases, especially when a well characterized index case is present in the family or in an isolated population. Unfortunately, many suspected patients do not present a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes, prompting the need to investigate additional biomarkers of the disease. Here, several HHT biomarkers and novel methodological approaches developed during the last years will be reviewed. On one hand, products detected in plasma or serum samples: soluble proteins (vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor β1, soluble endoglin, angiopoietin-2) and microRNA variants (miR-27a, miR-205, miR-210). On the other hand, differential HHT gene expression fingerprinting, next generation sequencing of a panel of genes involved in HHT, and infrared spectroscopy combined with artificial neural network patterns will also be reviewed. All these biomarkers might help to improve and refine HHT diagnosis by distinguishing from the non-HHT population.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by abnormal vascular structures that may present as epistaxis, telangiectasias, and/or arteriovenous malformations. The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGFβ pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGFβ signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations.

We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.

The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.

"	"Hepatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However, when present, clinical manifestations can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Current expertise in the variable clinical manifestations and recommendations for diagnostic approach and management of hepatic involvement in HHT are outlined. A review of current literature was performed using the MEDLINE search string: ""Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL] AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL])"". Due to the lack of therapeutic consequence, systematic screening for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic patients with HHT is currently not recommended. In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established.

The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients. It also leads to vascular remodeling in the zebrafish model.

The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.

27027094	"Implications of an Incidental Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation
"	"Introduction. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have been associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34-year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance. He underwent a pulmonary arteriography of the right upper and lower lobe with the use of a microcatheter system; however, the PAVM could not be visualized. Thus, he was managed medically. The patient was educated on the need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and surveillance imaging. Discussion. Our case highlights the importance of obtaining a complete past medical and family history in young patients with a history of recurrent epistaxis to elicit features of HHT. The diagnosis can be made clinically and directly affects family members, who would otherwise not receive appropriate screening.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by vascular dysplasia. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case in the literature of definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia diagnosed in western Kenya, a resource-limited setting with limited treatment options. A 60-year-old black Kenyan woman was admitted 1 year ago to a hospital in western Kenya with an 11-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis. Her physical examination revealed that she had telangiectasias on the tongue and hard palate, severe pallor, and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe opacity. After a positive saline contrast echocardiography, she underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, which revealed a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and multiple hepatic arteriovenous malformations. Therefore, she fulfilled criteria for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was managed with nasal packing, tranexamic acid, oral ferrous sulfate, and blood transfusions, as other treatment options were unavailable in this setting. This rare case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates that it occurs in an African population and that diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings can be surmounted. Treatment options remain limited in these settings.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Osler- Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may lead to severe complications. The diagnosis of HHT is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease, and the variety of clinical manifestations. The management of HHT includes systematic screening for visceral AVMs at regular intervals, preventive interventions to reduce the risk of complications, and symptomatic measures. A multidisciplinary standardized program in specialised centers may improve the management of patients with HHT.

"	"The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.

"	"We present the case of a patient who came to our attention for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Echocardiography showed moderate diastolic overload of both ventricles with enhanced cardiac output without valvular disease or cardiac shunt that could account for this cardiomegaly. A subsequent abdominal echocardiographic exploration showed an angiomatous transformation of the liver due to diffuse lacunar enlargement of hepatic portal vein branches and arterial-venous shunts. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the echocardiographic findings. **The imaging findings coupled with cutaneous and nasopharyngeal lesions were suggestive of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the diagnosis was confirmed after the identification of a mutation in the ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12. **HHT is a rare but underestimated vascular disease that can affect different organs, in particular the liver, leading to organ failure requiring transplantation as occurred in our patient. Echocardiography is a useful imaging tool to exclude cardiac abnormalities as a cause of cardiomegaly and to guide the correct diagnosis of a peripheral origin of high cardiac output.

28267932	"Hemoglobin Is a Vital Determinant of Arterial Oxygen Content in Hypoxemic Patients with Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations
"	"PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.

"	"It is well described that patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) have an increased risk of cerebral abscess (CA). However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%. The 3-month and 1-year mortality rates were 7.5% and 11.25%, respectively. There is an overrepresentation of HHT patients in a cohort of patients with CA, and HHT should be investigated as the cause of the CA if no other apparent cause can be identified.

While the pathophysiology underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with HHT is not fully understood, it is believed to occur by one of two mechanisms: increases in pulmonary vascular resistance or cardiac output. In the following report, we describe an interesting case of a 26-year-old woman with HHT whose right heart catheterization initially demonstrated PH with elements of both pre- and post-capillary PH. Once the pre-capillary PH component was treated, however, an underlying high-normal cardiac-output state was unmasked. [Full article available at http://rimed.org/rimedicaljournal-2017-08.asp].

"	"To discuss an uncommon case of a patient with multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) presenting with dyspnea on exertion and recurrent strokes. A 79-year-old woman with recent onset recurrent cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) was referred to cardiology for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. Clinical examination was unrevealing. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with agitated saline was suggestive of an extra-cardiac shunt. Subsequent chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated five large PAVMs. The patient underwent transcatheter coil embolization of the five PAVMs, resulting in marked improvement in dyspnea and resolution of the shunt on bubble study echocardiography. Although PAVMs are rare, they remain an important entity to consider when evaluating patients with extracardiac shunts. They may present with nonspecific features such as dyspnea on exertion and recurrent CVAs. All patients with multiple PAVMs should undergo thorough skin screening for telangiectasia as well as radiologic imaging to screen for additional AVMs in the liver and brain in order to exclude hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

"	"To investigate the clinical features and feasibility genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) family, and to explore the application of gene mutation testing in HHT diagnosis.  Methods: Medical histories and clinical features of a family were analyzed to diagnose HHT patients and suspected individuals according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family. A combination of clinical and genetic diagnosis could improve the diagnosis and treatment of HHT.

Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.

Four patients showed no improvement after treatment. Eleven patients (33.3%) showed initial improvement in both ESS and IFT, but the treatment was discontinued before the end of the study because the effect became gradually shorter lasting despite repeated injections. Twelve patients (36.3%) continued to have a positive response to the treatment at the end of the study. No local adverse effects were observed, but one patient developed osteonecrosis in both knees during the treatment period. Intranasal bevacizumab injection is an effective treatment for most of the moderate and severe grades of HHT-associated epistaxis. The duration of the effect of the treatment was variable.

A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.

Two CT studies with the longest interval between were evaluated (mean 8.4 y; median 8.8 y; range, 3.1-14.1 y). Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up.

In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. χ2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P = 0.005; intensity: P = 0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P = 0.012; intensity: P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P = 0.434) or intensity (P = 0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P < 0.001) and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P = 0.061; intensity: P = 0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P = 0.040) and intensity (P = 0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31910122	"Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary
"	"Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

32503579	"Current HHT genetic overview in Spain and its phenotypic correlation: data from RiHHTa registry
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Disease-causing variants in endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) genes are detected in more than 90% of cases submitted to molecular diagnosis. We used data from the RiHHTa (Computerized Registry of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) registry to describe genetic variants and to assess their genotype-phenotype correlation among HHT patients in Spain. By May 2019, 215 patients were included in the RiHHTa registry with a mean age of 52.5 ± 16.5 years and 136 (63.3%) were women. Definitive HHT diagnosis defined by the Curaçao criteria were met by 172 (80%) patients. Among 113 patients with genetic test, 77 (68.1%) showed a genetic variant in ACVRL1 and 36 (31.8%) in ENG gene. The identified genetic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG genes and their clinical significance are provided. ACVRL1 mutations were more frequently nonsense (50%) while ENG mutations were more frequently, frameshift (39.1%). ENG patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36.9 vs 45.7 years) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (71.4% vs 24.4%) and cerebral AVMs (17.6% vs 2%) more often than patients with ACVRL1 variants. Patients with ACVRL1 variants had a higher cardiac index (2.62 vs 3.46), higher levels of hepatic functional blood tests, and anemia (28.5% vs 56.7%) more often than ENG patients. ACVRL1 variants are more frequent than ENG in Spain. ACVRL1 patients developed symptomatic liver disease and anemia more often than ENG patients. Compared to ACVRL1, those with ENG variants are younger at diagnosis and show pulmonary and cerebral AVMs more frequently.

32723034	"Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review
"	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

"	"Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia affects between 1/5000 and 1/8000 people. It is characterized by presence of recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. It is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant transmission inducing an endothelial cells hyper-proliferation. A 68-year-old women with Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome was referred for management of general impairment with confusional syndrome and hyperthermia. Various examinations have allowed us to conclude at diagnosis of brain abscess with ventriculitis probably favored by right-left shunt secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. **Evolution was favorable after antibiotic treatment and endovascular embolization**. In case of brain abscess without obvious promoting factor, don't forget to looking for a right-left shunt providing septic or aseptic emboli. Furthermore, diagnosis of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome should be considered presence of telangiectasias and/or epistaxis.

ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 are the most common gene mutations reported in HPAH with HHT. We report a 11-year-old boy with a definite diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and suspected HHT with recurrent epistaxis. The results of gene detection showed that there was a nosense mutation in BMPR2. The results of gene detection of ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 were normal. Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension with suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Patient was treated with ambrisentan 2.5 mg qd. About a month later, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding and sudden convulsions. The patient's vital signs were stable after symptomatic treatment. After discharging from hospital, the patients continued to take ambrisentan. No epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding was found in one month of follow-up, but the symptoms of chest tightness were not significantly alleviated. BMPR2 with a nonsense mutation is more likely to cause HPAH with HHT and are more likely to be life-threatening.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of arteriovenous malformations. The arteriovenous shunts may result in high output heart failure, which predisposes to atrial dilatation and atrial fibrillation. Due to recurrent bleeding from epistaxis or the gastrointestinal tract, patients with HHT and atrial fibrillation are at high risk of bleeding if anticoagulated for stroke prevention. In this report, we present a case of a** 74-year-old woman with a history of HHT and atrial fibrillation who developed a large left atrial thrombus that initially was thought to represent an atrial myxoma. **The diagnosis was confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and **the patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus.** This case demonstrates the role of different imaging modalities in the assessment of left atrial masses and presents an opportunity to review the data on safety of anticoagulation in patients with HHT.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular disease characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and prognosis. Dietary evaluation is relevant in HHT patients to provide adequate iron and nutrient intake. Additionally, different dietary items have been reported to precipitate epistaxis in this setting. **Our primary aim was to investigate the dietary habits of HHT patients through a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate the presence of precipitants and/or protective factors for epistaxis and the occurrence of possible dietary modifications. The secondary aims were to evaluate the nutritional intake of iron in HHT patients and the self-reported effect of iron treatments on epistaxis**. From April 2018 to October 2018, a 138-item FFQ was provided to HHT patients followed up at the HHT Referral Center of Crema Maggiore Hospital. The relationship between food items and epistaxis was ascertained on a separate form. Daily iron intake was calculated to establish the mean iron content of food items reported in the FFQ. One hundred forty-nine questionnaires were evaluated [72 females, median age 54 years (12-76). Overall, 26 (18%) patients reported dietary items that improved epistaxis (mostly blueberries and red fruits, green vegetables and legumes), while 38 (26%) reported some dietary items that exacerbated epistaxis (spices, chocolate, alcohol, strawberries and ginger). Dietary modifications were reported in up to 58% of cases. In HHT patients, the mean daily iron intake was 8.46 ± 2.78 mg, and no differences were observed in the iron intake of patients reporting a diet modification and those who did not. In the comprehensive management of HHT a healthy and balanced diet, with increased consumption of dietary items with a high iron content, should be encouraged.

This rare disease can involve one or more organs and clinical manifestations interest several medical specialties. A review of recent literature and our clinical experience shows that COVID-19 pandemic greatly influences the autonomy and psychic sphere of patients with HHT, causing them further distress. Often patients affected by HHT experience a sense of loneliness due to the rarity of this pathology and COVID-19 pandemic adds a burden for them and their caregivers who have to face emotional experiences that interfere with personal, social and working functioning. Multidisciplinary approach and web-mediated counseling intervention could offer a valid and personalized support for patients affected by HHT and their caregivers during quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic.

"	"This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.

"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) and Endoglin (ENG) are the principal genes whose mutations cause HHT. A multicenter study to investigate the correlation between genetic variations and clinical outcomes in Korean HHT patients has been lacking. Seventy-two members from 40 families suspected of HHT based on symptoms were genetically screened for pathogenic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG. Patients with genetically diagnosed HHT were also evaluated. In the HHT genetic screening, 42 patients from 24 of the 40 families had genetic variants that met the pathogenic criteria (pathogenic very strong, pathogenic strong, pathogenic moderate, or pathogenic supporting) based on ACMG Standards and Guidelines in either ENG or ACVRL1; 26 from 12 families (50%) in ENG, and 16 from 12 families (50%) in ACVRL1. The diagnostic screening of 42 genetically positive HHT patients based on the Curaçao criteria revealed that 24 patients (57%) were in the definite group, 17 patients (41%) were in the probable group, and 1 patient (2%) was in the unlikely group. Epistaxis was the most common clinical presentation (38/42, 90%), followed by visceral AVMs (24/42, 57%), and telangiectasia (21/42, 50%). Five patients (12%) did not have a family history of HHT clinical symptoms. Among patients having ACVRL1 or ENG genetic variants, only about half of them could be clinically diagnosed as definite HHT, suggesting that genetic screening is important to confirm the diagnosis.
