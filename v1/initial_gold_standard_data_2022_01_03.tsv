19403253	Hereditary hemorragic telangiectasia and hepatic abcess	We report the case of a 27-year-old man presenting with a hepatic abscess and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The association between HHT and an infectious disease seemed to be induced by arteriovenous malformations and maybe also by a deficit of polymorphonuclear cells, a monocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis. This diagnosis should be suggested in case of serious infections in young patients. Prevention is based on screening for and destroying infection, antibioprophylaxis and embolization of arteriovenous malformations.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

19923167	CFTR is essential for sperm fertilizing capacity and is correlated with sperm quality in humans	Our previous studies have demonstrated the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is important for capacitation and male fertility in mouse and guinea pig spermatozoa. However, the exact function of CFTR on human sperm fertilizing capacity, and correlation with sperm quality has not been established. The present study may shed light on some unexplained male infertility, and on a possible new method for diagnosis of male infertility and strategy for male contraception. To assess the effect of CFTR on human sperm fertilizing capacity, we examined sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction using chlortetracycline staining, analyzed sperm hyperactivation by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA), measured intracellular cAMP levels using ElA and evaluated sperm penetration of zona-free hamster eggs assay in fertile men. The percentage of spermatozoa expressing CFTR from fertile, healthy and infertile men (mainly teratospermic, asthenoteratospermic, asthenospermic and oligospermic) was conducted by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Progesterone significantly facilitated human sperm capacitation and ZP3 triggered the acrosome reaction, both were significantly inhibited by CFTR inhibitor-172 (CFTRinh-172; 10 nM-1 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of 100 nM CFTRinh-172 markedly depressed intracellular cAMP levels, sperm hyperactivation and sperm penetration of zona-free hamster eggs. In addition, the percentage of spermatozoa expressing CFTR in the fertile men was significantly higher than healthy and infertile men categories (P < 0.01). CFTR is essential for human sperm fertilizing capacity and the impairment of CFTR expression in spermatozoa is correlated with a reduction of sperm quality. These results suggest that defective expression of CFTR in human sperm may lead to the reduction of sperm fertilizing capacity.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

19942457	Cost-utility analysis of rufinamide versus topiramate and lamotrigine for the treatment of children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in the United Kingdom	To estimate the cost-effectiveness of rufinamide relative to topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a three-year time horizon in patients with LGS uncontrolled by up to three antiepileptic drugs. Utilities were assigned to health states, defined according to a patient's response to treatment (> or =75%, > or =50% and <75%, and <50% reduction in tonic-atonic [drop attack] seizure frequency and death). Efficacy and safety estimates were made using indirect/mixed-treatment comparisons of data obtained from published literature. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), allowing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be estimated as cost per QALY gained. Over three years, the total cumulative costs for rufinamide, topiramate, and lamotrigine were pound24,992, pound23,360, and pound21,783, respectively. Rufinamide resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.079 relative to topiramate and 0.021 relative to lamotrigine. The incremental costs of rufinamide were pound1632 and pound3209, relative to topiramate and lamotrigine, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound20,538 and pound154,831, respectively. Considering the underlying assumptions, this current economic evaluation demonstrates that rufinamide is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate as adjunctive treatment for children with LGS in the UK. In addition, when compared to lamotrigine, which is an inexpensive treatment, rufinamide should be considered as a cost-effective alternative due to the importance of patient choice and equity of access in such a rare and devastating condition.

20004858	Adrenocorticotropic hormone versus pulsatile dexamethasone in the treatment of infantile epilepsy syndromes	For treatment of intractable epilepsies, there are no data comparing conventional adrenocorticotropic hormone and pulsatile corticoid therapy with dexamethasone. A retrospective comparison of efficacy was therefore conducted for both forms of application. Between 1989 and 2001, a series of 11 children with West syndrome and 3 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (group 1); between 2003 and 2006, 7 children with West syndrome, 5 with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep, and 2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with pulsatile corticoid therapy (group 2). In group 1 (n = 14), 9/11 West syndrome patients became seizure free, but none with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (0/3). In group 2 (n = 14), 4/7 West syndrome patients became seizure-free, 1/2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome exhibited seizure-frequency reduction, and 2/5 patients with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep exhibited significant improvement according to electroencephalograms. In West syndrome, pulsatile corticoid therapy was an effective alternative treatment to adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in general steroids did not lead to a significant seizure reduction. In electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, treatment with pulsatile corticoid therapy seems to be effective and should be investigated in a larger group of patients.

20008422	Resective pediatric epilepsy surgery in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of resective pediatric epilepsy surgery for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We analyzed clinical data of 27 children and adolescents who had LGS and underwent resective epilepsy surgery despite abundant (>30% of preoperative interictal and/or ictal epileptiform discharges) generalized or generalized contralateral maximal and multiregional electroencephalogram abnormalities. On high-resolution MRI, cerebral lesions were noted in 23 (85.2%) patients but not in 4 (14.8%) patients. The age of patients at the time of surgery was between 1.7 and 17.3 years (mean: 7.8 years). Surgeries were lobar or multilobar resection in 21 (77.8%) patients and hemispherotomy in 6 (22.2%). At a mean of 33.1 months' postoperative follow-up, 16 (59.3%) patients had no seizures and 4 (14.8%) had infrequent seizures. Of 4 patients without brain abnormalities found on MRI, 2 patients became seizure-free after resective surgery was performed on the basis of electrophysiologic studies and concordant results in other multimodal neuroimages. Malformation of cortical development was the most common pathology and was seen in 20 (74.1%) patients, but 2 (7.4% patients) did not show any abnormal pathology. Sixteen (72.7%) patients, including 14 who had no seizures and 2 who had infrequent seizures after surgery, showed an increase in developmental quotient. No clinical profile was significantly associated with postoperative seizure-free rate. Resective epilepsy surgery should be considered for children with LGS, despite abundant generalized and multiregional electroencephalogram abnormalities.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

20030794	Acute cellular rejection and Epstein-Barr virus-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in a pediatric lung transplant with low viral load	We report the case of an 18-year-old male who underwent bilateral lung transplantation for end-stage cystic fibrosis. No Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus serology mismatch was detected on pre-transplant evaluation (donor and recipient were both positive). Two months after lung transplantation a computed tomography scan showed multiple nodules throughout both lungs. At that time a low EBV DNA blood level was detected (<300 copies/100,000 lymphomonocytes). Scheduled follow-up transbronchial biopsy (TBB) revealed a prevalent finding characterized by perivascular lymphoid infiltrates with endothelitis. Extensive tissue coagulative necrosis with peripheral areas of dense aggregates of larger lymphoid cells were detected in the trans-thoracic fine needle core biopsy (FNCB) performed on the largest nodule. The immunophenotypic profile characterized the perivascular lymphoid cells in TBB as mainly composed of T lymphocytes (CD3 positive) while the larger number of lymphocytes in FNCB as B cells (CD20 positive). In situ hybridization for EBV (EBER mRNA) was negative in TBB while it was positive in many lymphocytes of the FNCB. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EBV was performed on paraffin-embedded FNCB and detected a high quantity of EBV genomes (1260 copies/cell). IgH gene rearrangement using a fragment size PCR technique revealed a monoclonal B-cell population in FNCB. Morphological and molecular findings suggest a final diagnosis of acute cellular rejection and a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) EBV-related in a lung transplant recipient with a low EBV DNA blood level. A possible coexistence of PTLD and acute rejection should be considered both for diagnosis and treatment. EBV PCR in the peripheral blood is a useful screening tool in transplant recipients; however, rare cases with PTLD may not have detectable levels of EBV DNA. This aspect should be taken into consideration to avoid false negatives.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

20032308	Interplay between ER exit code and domain conformation in CFTR misprocessing and rescue	Multiple mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) impair its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We compared two processing mutants: DeltaF508 and the ER exit code mutant DAA. Although both have severe kinetic processing defect, DAA but not DeltaF508 has substantial accumulation in its mature form, leading to higher level of processing at the steady state. DAA has much less profound conformational abnormalities. It has lower Hsp70 association and higher post-ER stability than DeltaF508. The ER exit code is necessary for DeltaF508 residual export and rescue. R555K, a mutation that rescues DeltaF508 misprocessing, improves Sec24 association and enhances its post-ER stability. Using in situ limited proteolysis, we demonstrated a clear change in trypsin sensitivity in DeltaF508 NBD1, which is reversed, together with that of other domains, by low temperature, R555K or both. We observed a conversion of the proteolytic pattern of DAA from the one resembling DeltaF508 to the one similar to wild-type CFTR during its maturation. Low temperature and R555K are additive in improving DeltaF508 conformational maturation and processing. Our data reveal a dual contribution of ER exit code and domain conformation to CFTR misprocessing and underscore the importance of conformational repair in effective rescue of DeltaF508.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20042709	Spontaneous adult-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to increased endothelial oxidative stress in a murine model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein receptors and changes in nitric oxide(_) (NO(_)) bioavailability are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and some forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. How these abnormalities lead to seemingly disparate pulmonary pathologies remains unknown. Endoglin (Eng), a transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor, is mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and involved in regulating endothelial NO(_) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO(_) production and oxidative stress. Because some patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension harbor ENG mutations leading to haplo insufficiency, we investigated the pulmonary vasculature of Eng(+/-) mice and the potential contribution of abnormal eNOS activation to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hemodynamic, histological, and biochemical assessments and x-ray micro-CT imaging of adult Eng(+/-) mice indicated signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension including increased right ventricular systolic pressure, degeneration of the distal pulmonary vasculature, and muscularization of small arteries. These findings were absent in 3-week-old Eng(+/-) mice and were attributable to constitutively uncoupled eNOS activity in the pulmonary circulation, as evidenced by reduced eNOS/heat shock protein 90 association and increased eNOS-derived superoxide ((_)O(2)(-)) production in a BH(4)-independent manner. These changes render eNOS unresponsive to regulation by transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein and underlie the signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that were prevented by Tempol. Adult Eng(+/-) mice acquire signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension that are attributable to uncoupled eNOS activity and increased (_)O(2)(-) production, which can be prevented by antioxidant treatment. Eng links transforming growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein receptors to the eNOS activation complex, and its reduction in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased oxidative stress and pulmonary arterial hypertension.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

20052366	The L441P mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and its molecular pathogenic mechanisms in a Korean patient with cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder usually found in populations of white Caucasian descent. CF is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. A 5-yr-old Korean girl was admitted complaining of coughing and greenish sputum. Chest radiographs and computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed diffuse bronchiectasis in both lungs. The patient had chronic diarrhea and poor weight gain, and the abdominal pancreaticobiliary CT scan revealed atrophy of the pancreas. Finally, CF was confirmed by the repeated analysis of the quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test. The chloride concentration of sweat samples taken from both forearms of the pateint was an average of 88.7 mM/L (normal value <40 mM/L). After a comprehensive search for mutations in the CFTR gene, the patient was found to carry the non-synonymous L441P mutation in one allele. Molecular physiologic analysis of the L441P mutation of CFTR revealed that the L441P mutation completely abolished the CFTR Cl(-) channel activity by disrupting proper protein folding and membrane trafficking of CFTR protein. These results confirmed the pathogenicity of the L441P mutation of CFTR circulating in the Korean population. The possibility of CF should be suspected in patients with chronic bronchiectasis, although the frequency of CF is relatively rare in East Asia.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20067780	Reduced plasma levels of Ang-2 and sEng as novel biomarkers in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by telangiectases and internal arteriovenous malformations caused by mutations in certain elements of the TGF-beta receptor complex. In the case of HHT1 mutations in the endoglin gene are responsible, whereas mutations in the ALK1 gene (an activin receptor-like kinase 1), lead to HHT2. Another two loci found at chromosome 5 and chromosome 7, whose target genes remain unidentified, lead to types 3 and 4 of the disease, respectively. Mutations in the MADH4/SMAD4 gene, another member of the TGF-beta signalling pathway, lead to a combined syndrome of familial juvenile polyposis associated with HHT. In an attempt to identify some soluble components differentially expressed in the plasma of HHT patients, angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin concentrations were analyzed with standard quantitative sandwich ELISA. **Angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin levels are reduced in plasma of HHT patients compared to control individuals, and a diagnostic algorithm for HHT based on these protein levels is proposed.** Down-regulated protein levels of angiopoietin-2 and soluble endoglin in plasma represent novel HHT biomarkers that could be useful in the biochemical diagnosis of HHT facilitating the rapid identification of potential HHT patients.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

20087969	An epistaxis severity score for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related epistaxis leads to alterations in social functioning and quality of life. Although more than 95% experience epistaxis, there is considerable variability of severity. Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score. Prospective, survey-based study. HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From** this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. **Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported e**pistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (**OR 1.53, P < .001 for all). R**isk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion**. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Although more than 95% experience epistaxis, there is considerable variability of severity. Because no standardized method exists to measure epistaxis severity, the purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with patient-reported severity to develop a severity score. Prospective, survey-based study. HHT care providers and a focus group of patients were interviewed to determine epistaxis-associated factors. From** this, an electronic survey was developed and administered to patients with HHT. **Descriptive analyses were performed with calculations of means and medians for continuous and proportions for categorical variables. Multiple ordinal logistic and linear regression models were developed to determine risk factors for epistaxis severity. Nine hundred respondents from 21 countries were included. Eight hundred fifty-five (95%) subjects reported e**pistaxis. The mean (standard deviation) age was 52.1 (13.9) years, and 61.4% were female. Independently associated risk factors for self-reported epistaxis severity included epistaxis frequency (odds ratio [OR] 1.57), duration (OR 2.17), intensity (OR 2.45), need for transfusion (OR 2.74), anemia (OR 1.44), and aggressiveness of treatment required (**OR 1.53, P < .001 for all). R**isk factors for increasing epistaxis severity in patients with HHT include frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes; invasiveness of prior therapy required to stop epistaxis; anemia; and the need for blood transfusion**. From these factors, an epistaxis severity score will be presented.
20093376	Swarming motility, secretion of type 3 effectors and biofilm formation phenotypes exhibited within a large cohort of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen capable of acutely infecting or persistently colonizing susceptible hosts. P. aeruginosa colonizes surfaces in vitro by either biofilm formation or swarming motility. The choice of behaviour is influenced by the physical properties of the surface and specific nutrient availability, and subject to regulatory networks that also govern type 2 and type 3 protein secretion. Biofilm formation by clinical isolates has been well-studied. However, the swarming behaviour of human isolates has not been extensively analysed. We collected isolates from 237 hospitalized patients without cystic fibrosis and analysed motility and secretion phenotypes of each isolate. We found biofilm formation and swarming to be negatively associated, while swarming was positively associated with the secretion of both proteases and type 3 exoenzymes. Most isolates were capable of type 3 secretion and biofilm formation, even though these traits are considered to favour distinct modes of pathogenesis. Our data demonstrate that while clinical isolates display diverse motility, biofilm and secretion phenotypes, many of the predicted relationships between swarming motility and other phenotypes observed in laboratory strains also hold true for bacteria isolated from human patients.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20099136	Heterologous expression of membrane proteins for structural analysis	Membrane proteins (MPs) are responsible for the interface between the exterior and the interior of the cell. These proteins are involved in numerous diseases, like cancer, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, hyperinsulinism, heart failure, hypertension and Alzheimer disease. However, studies of these disorders are hampered by a lack of structural information about the proteins involved. Structural analysis requires large quantities of pure and active proteins. The majority of medically and pharmaceutically relevant MPs are present in tissues at low concentration, which makes heterologous expression in large-scale production-adapted cells a prerequisite for structural studies. Obtaining mammalian MP structural data depends on the development of methods that allow the production of large quantities of MPs. This review focuses on the heterologous expression systems now available to produce large amounts of MPs for structural proteomics, and describes the strategies that allowed the determination of the structure of the first heterologously expressed mammalian MPs.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20101697	Overlapping spectra of SMAD4 mutations in juvenile polyposis (JP) and JP-HHT syndrome	Juvenile polyposis (JP) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are clinically distinct diseases caused by mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A (for JP) and endoglin and ALK1 (for HHT). Recently, a combined syndrome of JP-HHT was described that is also caused by mutations in SMAD4. Although both JP and JP-HHT are caused by SMAD4 mutations, a possible genotype:phenotype correlation was noted as all of the SMAD4 mutations in the JP-HHT patients were clustered in the COOH-terminal MH2 domain of the protein. If valid, this correlation would provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic differences, as well as a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test to distinguish patients at risk for the overlapping but different clinical features of the disorders. In this study, w**e collected 19 new JP-HHT patients from which we identified 15 additional SMAD4 mutations**. We also reviewed the literature for other reports of JP patients with HHT symptoms with confirmed SMAD4 mutations. **Our combined results show that although the SMAD4 mutations in JP-HHT patients do show a tendency to cluster in the MH2 domain, mutations in other parts of the gene also cause the combined syndrome. Thus, any mutation in SMAD4 can cause JP-HHT**. Any JP patient with a SMAD4 mutation is, therefore, at risk for the visceral manifestations of HHT and any HHT patient with SMAD4 mutation is at risk for early onset gastrointestinal cancer. In conclusion, a patient who tests positive for any SMAD4 mutation must be considered at risk for the combined syndrome of JP-HHT and monitored accordingly.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

20126329	Rufinamide: a novel broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug	The last 20 years have witnessed a tremendous explosion in the number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as well as the introduction of AEDS developed for specific epilepsy syndromes. The study of the efficacy and side effect profile of AEDs for unique epilepsy syndromes has allowed neurologists to utilize evidence-based medicine when treating patients. In late 2008, the Food and Drug Administration approved rufinamide for adjunctive use in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This unique chemical compound is also the first new AED to reach the market in the United States having a pediatric indication prior to approval for adults. Rufinamide appears to have a broad spectrum of efficacy, is well tolerated, and may be rapidly initiated--properties that will likely extend its use outside of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

A large descending thoracic aortic aneurysm with focal type B dissection was identified and excluded by emergency thoracic endografting. Further postoperative evaluation revealed a history of epistaxis, perioral telangiectasias, hepatic hypervascularity, and a mutation in the gene expressing activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), leading to a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Aortic aneurysms associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are extremely rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of thoracic endografting in this patient population.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

20142516	Regulation of conductance by the number of fixed positive charges in the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR chloride channel pore	"Rapid chloride permeation through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel is dependent on the presence of fixed positive charges in the permeation pathway. Here, we use site-directed mutagenesis and patch clamp recording to show that the functional role played by one such positive charge (K95) in the inner vestibule of the pore can be ""transplanted"" to a residue in a different transmembrane (TM) region (S1141). Thus, the mutant channel K95S/S1141K showed Cl(-) conductance and open-channel blocker interactions similar to those of wild-type CFTR, thereby ""rescuing"" the effects of the charge-neutralizing K95S mutation. Furthermore, the function of K95C/S1141C, but not K95C or S1141C, was inhibited by the oxidizing agent copper(II)-o-phenanthroline, and this inhibition was reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting disulfide bond formation between these two introduced cysteine side chains. These results suggest that the amino acid side chains of K95 (in TM1) and S1141 (in TM12) are functionally interchangeable and located closely together in the inner vestibule of the pore. This allowed us to investigate the functional effects of increasing the number of fixed positive charges in this vestibule from one (in wild type) to two (in the S1141K mutant). The S1141K mutant had similar Cl(-) conductance as wild type, but increased susceptibility to channel block by cytoplasmic anions including adenosine triphosphate, pyrophosphate, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, and Pt(NO(2))(4)(2-) in inside-out membrane patches. Furthermore, in cell-attached patch recordings, apparent voltage-dependent channel block by cytosolic anions was strengthened by the S1141K mutation. Thus, the Cl(-) channel function of CFTR is maximal with a single fixed positive charge in this part of the inner vestibule of the pore, and increasing the number of such charges to two causes a net decrease in overall Cl(-) transport through a combination of failure to increase Cl(-) conductance and increased susceptibility to channel block by cytosolic substances."	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20149600	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in adulthood: clinical and EEG features	We performed a retrospective study to investigate seizure, EEG, social and cognitive outcome in adult LGS subjects. We retrospectively evaluated 27 LGS patients aged 40-59 years. We assessed in particular the evolution of different seizure types and EEG findings, as well as cognitive and social outcome. During the early stages of the disease, all patients presented tonic seizures (TS) during wakefulness and sleep, 20/27 had atypical absences (AA), more rarely other seizure types. EEG showed slow background activity in 21/27 patients, diffuse slow spike-wave discharges (DSSW) during wakefulness in 22/27, and bursts of diffuse fast rhythms (DFR) in sleep in all patients. At last observation, 11 patients only had TS during wakefulness, but all still presented TS during sleep; AA persisted in 6 patients. EEG showed normal BA in 12/27 patients; only 7/27 still presented DSSW. On the contrary, sleep EEG showed the persistence of DFR in all. A moderate to severe cognitive impairment was observed in 26/27 patients. In adult LGS patients TS during sleep remain the major seizure type; moreover, a standard waking EEG may be normal. Thus, polysomnography represents the most important mean of investigation also in adult LGS patients.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

20151724	The cost effectiveness of rufinamide in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in the UK	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic childhood form of epilepsy. The syndrome is characterized by mental impairment, frequent seizures of multiple types that are particularly resistant to treatment, and high rates of seizure-related injury. With the introduction of newer, but more costly, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is important that decision makers are able to assess their value in the management of this rare and difficult-to-treat condition. To evaluate the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of rufinamide in patients with LGS. An individual patient-simulation model was developed to estimate the total treatment-related costs and clinical benefits of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine over a 3-year time horizon. The model examines the treatment scenarios of adding rufinamide, lamotrigine or topiramate to older AEDs (standard therapy), or standard therapy alone within a primary-care or community setting. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials of adjunctive AED treatment for children with LGS were analysed. There are no head-to-head comparator studies. Between 98 and 139 patients were randomized in each study and the mean age in each study was 10, 11 and 14 years. A mixed-treatment comparison using a random-effects model was carried out on the number of patients in each response category, using the placebo arms of the respective trials. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of successfully treated patients, defined as >50% reduction in the frequency of total seizures and drop attacks. The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. Costs ( pound, year 2006/07 values) of patient monitoring, switching treatments, hospitalization due to seizure, treatment of adverse effects, and personal and social services were included in the analysis. Results of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were bootstrapped to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Over 3 years, adjunctive rufinamide resulted in higher total costs than topiramate and lamotrigine; however, with more patients being treated successfully, this leads to acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. If society is prepared to pay at least 250 pounds for a 1% increase in the number of successfully treated LGS patients, in terms of a 50% reduction in the frequency of drop attacks, the probability of the treatment with rufinamide being cost effective is >80%. This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that rufinamide results in more LGS patients being treated successfully at a reasonable cost from a UK NHS perspective.

Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood. To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Prospective, descriptive study. Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007. This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin <9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy investigation. Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences. Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7%) and 26 (86.7%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7% of patients. Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation. This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Selective catheterization and embolization of the right lingual artery led to size redution and no bleeding from tongue telangiectases.
20199521	Adjunctive rufinamide in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a long-term, open-label extension study	This open-label extension evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who had previously completed a 12-week double-blind study. In total, 124 patients (aged 4-37 years), receiving 1-3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs, were treated with rufinamide approximately 25-60 mg/kg/day. Efficacy was assessed by seizure frequency; tolerability by adverse events (AEs) and laboratory tests. Overall, patients were treated with rufinamide for a median (range) of 432 (10-1149) days. Reductions in seizure frequency were observed throughout the study; during the last 12 months of treatment, 41.0% and 47.9% of patients had > or = 50% reduction in total and tonic-atonic seizure frequency, respectively. The most common AEs were vomiting (30.6%) and pyrexia (25.8%). In this open-label extension, rufinamide appeared to be an effective long-term adjunctive therapy for the treatment of LGS-associated seizures in children and young adults.

20202952	Hemothorax due to rupture of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation: an interventional emergency	Spontaneous hemothorax as a result of a ruptured pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a life-threatening event and requires immediate interventional therapy. We present two patients who survived following emergent embolization. Definitive thoracentesis was delayed until embolization was performed. The tamponade provided by the hemothorax may have prevented exsanguination, suggesting to us that drainage of blood from the pleural space should be delayed until the PAVM has been treated. Hemorrhage from a PAVM may be the first manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Genetic testing and screening for other family members should be considered.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

20224041	Pathogenesis of arteriovenous malformations in the absence of endoglin	Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in anomalous direct blood flow between arteries and veins, bypassing the normal capillary bed. Depending on size and location, AVMs may lead to severe clinical effects including systemic cyanosis (pulmonary AVMs), hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral AVMs) and high output cardiac failure (hepatic AVMs). The factors leading to AVM formation are poorly understood, but patients with the familial disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) develop AVMs at high frequency. As most HHT patients have mutations in ENG (endoglin) or ACVRL1 (activin receptor-like kinase 1), a better understanding of the role of these genes in vascular development is likely to reveal the etiology of AVM formation.** Using a mouse with a conditional mutation in the Eng gene, we investigated the sequence of abnormal cellular events occurring during development of an AVM.** In the absence of endoglin, subcutaneous Matrigel implants in adult mice were populated by reduced numbers of new blood vessels compared with controls, and resulted in local venous enlargement (venomegaly). To investigate abnormal vascular responses in more detail, we turned to the more readily** accessible vasculature of the neonatal retina**. Endoglin-**deficient retinas exhibited delayed remodeling of the capillary plexus, increased proliferation of endothelial cells and localized AVMs.** Muscularization of the resulting arteriovenous shunts appeared to be a secondary response to increased blood flow. AVMs develop when an angiogenic stimulus is combined with endoglin depletion. Moreover, AVM formation appears to result from the combination of delayed vascular remodeling and an inappropriate endothelial cell proliferation response in the absence of endoglin.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

20309575	The characterization of the first anti-mouse Muc6 antibody shows an increased expression of the mucin in pancreatic tissue of Cftr-knockout mice	Gel-forming mucins are large high-molecular weight secreted O-glycoproteins responsible for the gel-properties of the mucus blanket. Five orthologous gel-forming mucins have been cloned in human and mouse. Among them, the mucin MUC6 has been less studied, particularly in rodents and no anti rodent-Muc6 antibody has been reported yet. In order to further study Muc6 in mice, our aims were to obtain a specific Muc6 antibody, to validate it and to test it in Cftr deficient mice. A polyclonal serum named CP4 was isolated from a rabbit immunized by a mouse Muc6 peptide. In Western blot experiments, the antibody detected a high-molecular weight molecule secreted by the gastric tissue. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that the antibody reacted strongly with deep glands of duodenum and ileum and mucous neck cells of gastric body. CP4 also recognized Muc6 protein secreted at the surface of the stomach and renal collecting tubules. The centroacinar cells of pancreatic tissue also reacted with the antibody. Cftr-/- mice showed a higher expression of Muc6 at both protein and RNA levels compared with their control Cftr+/+ littermates suggesting that as in the human disease, Muc6 may contribute to the formation of materials that block pancreatic acini and ducts in mouse models of cystic fibrosis. The rabbit anti-mouse Muc6 polyclonal antibody seems highly specific to the mouse mucin and will be useful to study pancreatic pathology in cystic fibrosis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20345938	Infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms: report of 19 patients	Late-onset spasms (LOS) are epileptic spasms starting after the first year of life. Our aim was to assess the electroclinical features and the follow-up of the patients with this particular type of epileptic seizure. We retrospectively included all patients with LOS confirmed by electroencephalography between 1989 and 2008. Clinical and electroencephalographic findings at diagnosis and during follow-up were collected. The Vineland scale was used to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome. We report 19 patients with LOS of 240 patients with recorded epileptic spasms. Eighteen patients had an epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. The ictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed a focal or generalized discharge of triphasic slow-waves, slow-spikes, or slow spikes-waves with fast activities. The interictal EEG usually showed focal or generalized slow-waves or slow spikes-waves without hypsarhythmia. LOS were controlled in only six patients. Three developed typical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 10 had a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Neuropsychological outcome was evaluated in 15 patients with the Vineland scale. Cognitive functions were normal in only one patient, whereas severe cognitive delay was observed in 12 of 15. Epileptic spasms may appear after the age of one. They are more frequently observed in patients with epileptic encephalopathy. In few patients this type of seizure was observed before the patients fulfill Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria. In one patient, we diagnosed a focal epilepsy with seizures occurring in cluster. When LOS are related to an epileptic encephalopathy, this epileptic syndrome seems to be linked to refractory epilepsy and severe cognitive outcome unrelated to the etiology.

20346358	Chloride channels and transporters in human corneal epithelium	Transport of water and electrolytes is critical for corneal clarity. Recent studies indicate another important function of transport of ions and electrolytes - establishing wound electric fields that guide cell migration. We found chloride (Cl(-)) flux is a major component of the corneal wound electric current. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of Cl(-) transport, we studied Cl(-) channels and transporters in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. We tested a transformed human corneal epithelial cell line (tHCE), primary cultures of human corneal epithelial cells (pHCE), and human donor corneas. We first used RT-PCR to determine expression levels of mRNA of CLC (Cl(-) channels/transporters of CLC gene family) family members and CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) in HCE cells. We then confirmed protein expression and distribution of selected CLC family members and CFTR with Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Finally, Cl(-) currents were recorded with electrophysiological techniques. The mRNAs of CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-5, CLC-6, and CFTR were detected in the HCE cell line. CLC-1 and CLC-7 were not detectable. Western blot and immunostaining confirmed protein expression and distribution of CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6 and CFTR in human corneal epithelium. CLC-2 preferentially labeled the apical and basal layers, while CLC-3 and CLC-4 labeled only the superficial layer. CLC-6 and CFTR labeling showed a unique gradient with strong staining in apical layers which gradually decreased towards the basal layers. Corneal endothelium was positive for CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6 and possibly CFTR. Human corneal epithelial cells demonstrated voltage dependent Cl(-) currents. HCE cells express functional Cl(-) channels and transporters. CLC-2, CLC-3, CLC-4, CLC-6, and CFTR had distinct expression patterns in human corneal epithelium. Those molecules and their distribution may play important roles in maintaining resting Cl(-) fluxes and in regulating Cl(-) flux at corneal wounds, which may be a major contributor to wound electrical signaling.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

As alternative treatment modalities repeatedly failed and the patient became almost permanently dependent on nasal dressing, we performed a highly conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the nasal cavity; a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy single fractions was applied. The therapy was very well tolerated, no acute toxicities occurred. Two weeks after the last radiation dose had been applied, the nasal dressing could be removed without problems. Endoscopical control revealed an almost avascular white mucosa without any trace of bleeding spots; previously existing hemangiomas and crusts had disappeared. After a 1-year-follow up, the patient had no significant recurrent epistaxis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

20384723	Frameshift mutations of the ARX gene in familial Ohtahara syndrome	Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy and is frequently associated with brain malformations, such as hemimegalencephaly. Recently, longer expansion of the first polyalanine tract of ARX was found to be causative for Ohtahara syndrome without brain malformation, whereas premature termination mutations of ARX were found to cause severe brain malformations, such as lissencephaly or hydranencephaly. Both are designated as ARX-related interneuronopathies. We investigated the molecular basis of Ohtahara syndrome in two families, comprising six male patients in two generations demonstrating X-linked inheritance. Novel frameshift mutations in the terminal exon of the ARX gene (Ala524fsX534 and E536fsX672) were identified in two patients (2 and 13 years, each) from both families. Two patients developed West syndrome, and one of these later developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all patients showed no brain malformations in contrast to the patients with a premature termination mutation in other exons of ARX. The etiology of Ohtahara syndrome is heterogeneous; however, the molecular analysis of ARX should be considered in sporadic or familial male patients with Ohtahara syndrome.

20519934	SPLUNC1 expression reduces surface levels of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in Xenopus laevis oocytes.	Throughout the body, the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) plays a critical role in salt and liquid homeostasis. In cystic fibrosis airways, for instance, improper regulation of ENaC results in hyperabsorption of sodium that causes dehydration of airway surface liquid. This dysregulation then contributes to mucus stasis and chronic lung infections. ENaC is known to undergo proteolytic cleavage, which is required for its ability to conduct Na(+) ions. We have previously shown that the short, palate lung and nasal epithelial clone (SPLUNC1) binds to and inhibits ENaC in both airway epithelia and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In this study, we found that SPLUNC1 was more potent at inhibiting ENaC than either SPLUNC2 or long PLUNC1 (LPLUNC1), two other PLUNC family proteins that are also expressed in airway epithelia. Furthermore, we were able to shed light on the potential mechanism of SPLUNC1's inhibition of ENaC. While SPLUNC1 did not inhibit proteolytic activity of trypsin, it significantly reduced ENaC currents by reducing the number of ENaCs in the plasma membrane. A better understanding of ENaC's regulation by endogenous inhibitors may aid in the development of novel therapies designed to inhibit hyperactive ENaC in cystic fibrosis epithelia.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20569877	Tolerance and efficacy of ceftazidime in combination with aztreonam for exacerbations of cystic fibrosis	Antibiotic therapy for acute pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis is usually chosen based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility. This can be difficult when bacteria are multiresistant. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the tolerance and efficiency of ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) in the treatment of acute exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients who were chronically colonized with multiresistant P. aeruginosa. Seventeen severe patients, with FEV(1)=1070+/-66 mL and BMI=18+/-0.6 kg/m(2), who had chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa with intermediate sensitivity or resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam, were studied between June 2003 and March 2007. Oxygen saturation, dyspnoea, weight, FEV(1), FVC, and tolerance were evaluated before and after antibiotic courses. Forty-two courses of treatment, administered between June 2003 and March 2007 were studied: Patients increased their FEV(1) and FVC (p=0.01). One antibiotic course was stopped after four days because of cutaneous side effects. The median delay until the next exacerbation was 101+/-10 days. These courses were compared with other combinations of antibiotics that the patients had received before. The combination of ceftazidime and aztreonam was more effective in patients receiving less than four courses per year for acute pulmonary exacerbation. In chronically P. aeruginosa colonised cystic fibrosis patients, ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) is well tolerated and efficient. This treatment suggests a clinical and functional benefit is possible, even in patients with severe disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

20597077	Measurement of airway ion transport assists the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis	The nasal potential difference (PD) demonstrates the increased Na absorption and decreased Cl secretion typically found in cystic fibrosis (CF). It provides useful information for diagnostic purposes and measures the effect of new treatments on the ion transport defects found in CF. This study summarizes the nasal PD results in the respiratory tract of different groups of subjects, examines the responses in squamous epithelia and evaluates new ways to consider nasal PD results.Nasal PD was tested using the standard protocol of baseline, amiloride, low chloride, and isoproterenol solutions in 40 healthy non-CF volunteers, 46 CF subjects, and 78 subjects referred for investigation of possible CF. Nasal PD was also measured in the squamous epithelium at the anterior nares in six non-CF subjects.Baseline PD was elevated in the CF (47.5 (1.7) mV) compared with non-CF subjects: (14.0 (0.8) mV, P < 0.00001). Combined [Cl + Isop] responses were smaller in the CF (-0.1 (0.4) mV) compared with the non-CF subjects (26.2 (1.2) mV, P < 0.00001). In the diagnostic cohort 58 were given a non-CF diagnosis, 16 had CF confirmed, but 4 remained indeterminate. Separate consideration of Na and Cl transport was easily portrayed through X-Y plots. Finally, the nasal PD responses of squamous epithelium showed high baseline values, but little response to amiloride and low chloride solutions.The nasal PD provides useful information in the diagnostic algorithm of CF, and in the delineation of the two ion transport defects characteristically found in the respiratory epithelium. Avoidance of the squamous epithelium remains an important consideration for those performing and interpreting nasal PD responses.	cystic fibrosis	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY		324	Measurement of airway ion transport assists the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The nasal potential difference (PD) demonstrates the increased Na absorption and decreased Cl secretion typically found in cystic fibrosis (CF). It provides useful information for diagnostic purposes and measures the effect of new treatments on the ion transport defects found in CF. This study summarizes the nasal PD results in the respiratory tract of different groups of subjects, examines the responses in squamous epithelia and evaluates new ways to consider nasal PD results.Nasal PD was tested using the standard protocol of baseline, amiloride, low chloride, and isoproterenol solutions in 40 healthy non-CF volunteers, 46 CF subjects, and 78 subjects referred for investigation of possible CF. Nasal PD was also measured in the squamous epithelium at the anterior nares in six non-CF subjects.Baseline PD was elevated in the CF (47.5 (1.7) mV) compared with non-CF subjects: (14.0 (0.8) mV, P < 0.00001). Combined [Cl + Isop] responses were smaller in the CF (-0.1 (0.4) mV) compared with the non-CF subjects (26.2 (1.2) mV, P < 0.00001). In the diagnostic cohort 58 were given a non-CF diagnosis, 16 had CF confirmed, but 4 remained indeterminate. Separate consideration of Na and Cl transport was easily portrayed through X-Y plots.

20598586	Long-term outcome and tolerability of the ketogenic diet in drug-resistant childhood epilepsy--the Austrian experience	"**To evaluate the long-term efficacy/tolerability of the ketogenic diet (KD) in paediatric drug-resistant epilepsies.** Data from children who were treated between 1999 and 2008 and had continuous follow-up of at least 6 months after initiation of the KD were analysed retrospectively. Response was defined as > or = 50% seizure reduction. Treatment effects on EEG, developmental outcome and the ""outcome-predictive"" value of various clinical factors were also assessed. 50 children (22 boys; mean age 4.5 years+/-3.55) were included. Mean follow-up was 3.93+/-2.95. 50% of the patients were responders, 48% of them became seizure free. 50% were non-responders, 20% of them deteriorated. In responders, EEG background activity improved significantly (p=0.014) and a significantly lower rate of epileptic discharges (p=0.009) was seen after 6 months. In addition, neurological examination findings demonstrated significant developmental progress (p=0.038). Favourable treatment outcome was associated with a shorter disease duration (p=0.025) and generalised tonic clonic seizures (p=0.059). No further significant outcome predictors were detected. However, response was 44% in patients with infantile spasms, 62.5% in those with Dravet syndrome and 50% in Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome. Side effects occurred in 28%, but discontinuation of the KD was not required in any case. They most often observed with concomitant topiramate (p=0.001) and valproate (p=0.046).

20610118	Infantile spasms: does season influence onset and long-term outcome?	To study whether onset of infantile spasms manifests seasonal variation, as previously reported, and whether any such seasonality is associated with treatment response and long-term outcome, data for 57 patients were retrospectively reviewed. The data were collected from hospital files and through a mail survey of children with infantile spasms born from 1980 to 2002 and monitored at the University Children's Hospital of Berne, Switzerland. The mean age at time of onset of infantile spasms was 7 months (range, 0.75-40), at diagnosis 8 months (range, 1-42) and at follow-up 11.3 years (range, 1-23 years). In 77% of participants, the etiology of infantile spasms was known (symptomatic); in the remaining 23% it was not known (nonsymptomatic). In contrast to previous findings, onset of infantile spasms was not associated with calendar month, photoperiod, or global solar radiation. Long-term prognosis was poor: 4 of the 57 (7%) children died; 49 (86%) had cognitive impairment and 40 (70%) had physical impairment; 31 (54%) had cerebral palsy, 37 had (65%) persistent seizures, and 9 (16%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Symptomatic infantile spasms were associated with worse cognitive outcome (P < 0.001), but treatment modality and overall duration of infantile spasms were not. There was no association of calendar month or photoperiod at onset with cognitive outcome or treatment response.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

20618411	Outcome of vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy in Budapest	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients with intractable epilepsy. Better clinical outcomes were recorded in nonfocal and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). **We conducted a 2-year, open label, prospective study to measure the seizure outcome of 26 VNS patients**. The seizure numbers were assessed using clinician's global impression scale (CGI) and patient diaries. The average seizure reduction was 23% at the first year and 22% at the second year. Seizure reduction was more pronounced among patients with nonfocal than with focal epilepsy. The response rate was 50% at first year and 30% at the second year. The best CGI record for clinically significant improvement was 15% in the LGS group. The only statistically significant result was the reduction of the generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The side-effect profile was good; however, the large number of mild and reversible effects influenced the stimulation parameters and thus probably the effectiveness of the therapy. We suggest that VNS is an optional treatment mostly in cases of therapy-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients with GTCS may experience improvement such as reduction of seizure severity. We conclude that VNS is a safe neuromodulatory treatment, but future developments of neuromodulatory approaches are needed.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

20651854	Characterization of clonal strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients in Ontario, Canada	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can form biofilms in the lungs and airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, resulting in chronic endobronchial infection. Two clonal strains of P. aeruginosa, named type A and type B, have recently been identified and have been found to infect more than 20% of CF patients in Ontario, Canada. In this study, 4 type A and 4 type B isolates retrieved from 8 CF patients in Ontario, Canada, were characterized. All 8 isolates grew well in rich medium and formed biofilms in vitro. Antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria grown in biofilms and planktonic culture were studied via minimal bactericidal concentration assays for tobramycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. Compared to laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa, all 8 isolates showed increased resistance to all antibiotics studied in both biofilm and planktonic assays. Gene expression analysis of mexX, representing the MexXY-OprM efflux pump, and mexA, representing MexAB-OprM, revealed that these genes were up-regulated in the 8 clinical isolates. These results suggest clonal type A and type B isolates of P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients in Ontario, Canada, show a multidrug resistance pattern that can be partially explained as being due to the increased expression of common antibiotic efflux systems.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20667149	Repeatability of the 6-minute walk test in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis	To determine the repeatability of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). This was a prospective cross-sectional study. We included consecutive patients ages>or=15 years attending an adult CF program. The patients underwent the 6MWT, pulmonary function tests, and clinical evaluation. The second 6MWT was performed following a rest period of 60 min. Thirty-one patients were included. The mean+/-SD age was 23.5+/-6.7 y, and the mean FEV1 was 61+/-28% of predicted. The mean+/-SD walked distance in the first 6MWT was 583.6+/-68.6 m and in the second 6MWT was 590.0+/-72.2 m. The mean difference between the first and second 6MWT was -6.5 m, with limits of agreement between -74.9 m and 61.9 m, and the coefficient of variation was 4.3%. The mean oxygen desaturation in the first 6MWT was 2.5+/-4.5%, and in the second test it was 1.8+/-4.0%. The mean difference between the first and second test was 0.6%, and the coefficient of variation was 104%. Although the 6MWT distance was reproducible, the wide limits of agreement exceeded the minimum important difference for this test. These findings indicate that, in the routine evaluation of CF patients, at least two 6MWTs are required on any testing occasion to obtain a reliable estimate of the 6MWT distance.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

20692461	Case report: cystic fibrosis, lung transplantation, and the novel H1N1 flu	The H1N1 pandemic flu is a significant risk factor for both patients with chronic disease who need organ transplantation and transplant recipients. This population needs special care regarding comorbidities and related complications. MB, a 38-year-old Italian cystic fibrosis male patient with lung and pancreatic involvement, was referred to our division in July 2009 for fever-associated arthromyalgia, headache, and rhinitis. Lung transplantation had been performed in September 2005, and he was subsequently treated with immunosuppressive therapy: tacrolimus, everolimus, and prednisolone. In the past, chronic respiratory colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and intermittent infection with Aspergillus flavus, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus complicated his clinical history. He started antiviral treatment with oseltamivir despite no travel history and no respiratory symptoms. H1N1 swab was positive. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for the persistence of fever and the onset of cough. Chest x-ray showed a left lower pneumonia, which was confirmed by computerized tomography. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy led to an improvement of the clinical condition. The patient was discharged 8 days later; a control swab was negative. This case report suggests some general considerations regarding solid organ recipients: 1) Flu-related complications require early treatment (both antiviral and antibiotic); 2) active microbiologic surveillance is important to prevent lethal infections (ie, invasive aspergillosis); 3) evaluation of immunosuppressant blood levels is necessary for drug-drug interactions. Active prevention is the best option for decreasing morbidity and mortality in the transplanted patient.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

20717170	p.Ser1235Arg should no longer be considered as a cystic fibrosis mutation: results from a large collaborative study	Among the 1700 mutations reported in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a missense mutation, p.Ser1235Arg, is a relatively frequent finding. To clarify its clinical significance, we collected data from 104 subjects heterozygous for the mutation p.Ser1235Arg from the French CF network, addressed for various indications including classical CF, atypical phenotypes or carrier screening in subjects with or without a family history. Among them, 26 patients (5 having CF, 10 CBAVD (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) and 11 with CF-like symptoms) and 14 healthy subjects were compound heterozygous for a second CFTR mutation. An exhaustive CFTR gene analysis identified a second mutation in cis of p.Ser1235Arg in all CF patients and in 81.8% CBAVD patients. Moreover, epidemiological data from >2100 individuals found a higher frequency of p.Ser1235Arg in the general population than in CF or CBAVD patients. These data, added to the fact that in silico analysis and functional assays suggest a benign nature of this substitution, give several lines of evidence against an association of p.Ser1235Arg with CF or CBAVD.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20802934	High prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with SCCmec type III in cystic fibrosis patients in southern, Brazil	Bacterial colonization of the lungs is the main cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus are very well adapted to the pulmonary environment and may persist for years in the same patient. Genetic determinants of these bacteria, such as the presence of SCCmec have recently emerged as a problem in this population of patients. Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from different clinical materials coming from CF and non-CF patients attended at a cystic fibrosis reference hospital were compared according to SCCmec type and antibiotic susceptibility profile. Three hundred and sixty-four single-patient Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected, of which 164 (45%) were from CF patients. Among the latter, 57/164 (44.5%) were MRSA, and among the non-CF patients, 89/200 (35%) were MRSA. Associated pathogens were found in 38 CF patients. All 57 MRSA from CF patients harbored the multiresistant cassette type III. In contrast, 31/89 MRSA from non-CF patients harbored SCCmec type I (35%) and 44/89 harbored type III (49%). The antibiotic susceptibility pattern was similar between CF and non-CF patients. The high prevalence of multiresistant SCCmec type III among CF patients compared with non-CF patients in our institution may make it difficult to control disease progression through antibiotic therapy for promoting the survival of this kind of patient.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

The majority of cases were clinically diagnosed at variable ages with variable neurological outcomes. Only 29.3% were detected by neonatal screening. Two unusual cases were observed in the context of inadequate treatment in 1 and delayed therapy in the other: a newborn with PKU developed severe keratomalacia; and a 5-year-old girl with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency due to a novel mutation identified in the quinoid dihydropteridine reductase gene developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and white matter changes with periventricular cysts. Part of our experience parallels that in the West. However, the clinical manifestations observed in our patients emphasize the importance of a national newborn screening program with efficient management of diagnosed cases.

20879701	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			257	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management.

20888268	Rufinamide in children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: first Italian multicenter experience	**This is the first multicenter Italian experience with rufinamide as an adjunctive drug in children, adolescents and adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. **The patients were enrolled in a prospective, add-on, open-label treatment study from 11 Italian centers for children and adolescent epilepsy care. Forty-three patients (26 males, 17 females), aged between 4 and 34 years (mean 15.9 ± 7.3, median 15.0), were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months). Twenty patients were diagnosed as cryptogenic and 23 as symptomatic. Rufinamide was added to the baseline therapy at the starting dose of 10mg/kg body weight, evenly divided in two daily doses and then increased by 10mg/kg approximately every 3 days up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day in children aged ≥4 years with a body weight less than 30 kg. In patients more than 30 kg body weight, rufinamide could be titrated up to 3200 mg/day. After a mean follow-up period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months), the final mean dose of rufinamide was 33.5mg/kg/24h (range 11.5-60) if combined to valproic acid, and of 54.5mg/kg/24h (range 21.8-85.6) without valproic acid. The response rate (≥50% decrease in countable seizures) was 60.5% (26 of 45 patients) in total; 51.1% experienced a 50-99% reduction in seizure frequency and complete seizure control was achieved in the last 4 weeks follow-up by 9.3% of patients. Two patients (4.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in 13 (30.2%) and increased in 2 (4.7%). Reliable data for atypical absence seizures and myoclonic seizures were not available, as these are usually impossible to count. Ten patients (23.2%) reported adverse side effects, while taking rufinamide. They were generally mild and transient and most frequently included vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite. In conclusion, rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy reduced the number of drop attacks and major motor seizures in about 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and produced only mild or moderate adverse side effects.

Forty-three patients (26 males, 17 females), aged between 4 and 34 years (mean 15.9 ± 7.3, median 15.0), were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 12.3 months (range 3-21 months). Twenty patients were diagnosed as cryptogenic and 23 as symptomatic. Rufinamide was added to the baseline therapy at the starting dose of 10mg/kg body weight, evenly divided in two daily doses and then increased by 10mg/kg approximately every 3 days up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day in children aged ≥4 years with a body weight less than 30 kg.

20927127	PTX3 genetic variations affect the risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway colonization in cystic fibrosis patients	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, and the gene responsible is the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Patients with CF have repeated bacterial infection of the airways caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which is one of the predominant pathogen, and endobronchial chronic infection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a gene that encodes the antimicrobial protein, PTX3, which is believed to have an important role in innate immunity of lung. To address the role of PTX3 in the risk of PA lung colonization, we investigated five single nucleotide polymorphisms of PTX3 gene in 172 Caucasian CF patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. We observed that PTX3 haplotype frequencies were significantly different between patients with PA colonization, as compared with noncolonized patients. Moreover, a protective effect was found in association with a specific haplotype (odds ratio 0.524). Our data suggest that variations within PTX3 affect lung colonization of Pseudomonas in patients with CF.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20933420	Cse1l is a negative regulator of CFTR-dependent fluid secretion	Transport of chloride through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel is a key step in regulating fluid secretion in vertebrates [1, 2]. Loss of CFTR function leads to cystic fibrosis [1, 3, 4], a disease that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and vas deferens. Conversely, uncontrolled activation of the channel leads to increased fluid secretion and plays a major role in several diseases and conditions including cholera [5, 6] and other secretory diarrheas [7] as well as polycystic kidney disease [8-10]. Understanding how CFTR activity is regulated in vivo has been limited by the lack of a genetic model. Here, we used a forward genetic approach in zebrafish to uncover CFTR regulators. We report the identification, isolation, and characterization of a mutation in the zebrafish cse1l gene that leads to the sudden and dramatic expansion of the gut tube. We show that this phenotype results from a rapid accumulation of fluid due to the uncontrolled activation of the CFTR channel. Analyses in zebrafish larvae and mammalian cells indicate that Cse1l is a negative regulator of CFTR-dependent fluid secretion. This work demonstrates the importance of fluid homeostasis in development and establishes the zebrafish as a much-needed model system to study CFTR regulation in vivo.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

20947455	Lactate in cystic fibrosis sputum	Antibiotic therapy is thought to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by decreasing neutrophil-derived inflammation. We investigated the origin and clinical significance of lactate in the chronically inflamed CF lung. Lactate was measured in sputa of 18 exacerbated and 25 stable CF patients via spectrophotometry and gaschromatography. Lung function was assessed via spirometry. Seven patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and three patients with acute lung inflammation served as control groups. Neutrophil and bacterial lactate production was assessed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In sputum specimens of patients with respiratory exacerbations lactate concentrations decreased significantly (p<0.005) from 3.4±2.3mmol/L to 1.4±1.4mmol/L after 2-3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Successful treatment was reflected in 16 patients (88.9%) by FVC increase associated with lactate decrease (p<0.05). In every single sputum lactate was detectable (3.0±3.1mmol/L, range 0.2-14.1mmol/L). Lactate was lower (1.6±0.8mmol/L) in sputa from seven COPD patients, and it was below the detection limit in three patients with acute lung inflammation. Neutrophil lactate production accumulated up to 10.5mmol/L after 4 days, whereas bacterial lactate production did not appear to contribute substantially to sputum lactate concentrations. Successful antibiotic therapy is reflected by a decrease in lactate concentrations. Neutrophils are the most likely source for lactate in sputum of CF patients. Therefore lactate may be used to monitor responses to antibiotic therapy as an adjunct to lung function measurements.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

20957124	Treating Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in epileptic pediatric patients with third-generation rufinamide	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare but debilitating pediatric epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple intractable seizure types. Treatment of LGS is challenging because of the small number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which are effective for this syndrome, as well as the need for polytherapy in the majority of patients. **This review focuses **on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide, a recently approved third-generation AED with reported efficacy as adjunctive therapy for LGS. All relevant papers identified through a PubMed search on the treatment of LGS with rufinamide were reviewed. To date, the literature suggests improvements in seizure frequency for pediatric patients with LGS on rufinamide. Rufinamide appears to be especially effective for atonic or drop attack seizures. Rufinamide also displays a favorable adverse event profile compared with the older anticonvulsants, as well as a minimal number of drug interactions, making it a promising option for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS.

20961363	Potential of ceragenin CSA-13 and its mixture with pluronic F-127 as treatment of topical bacterial infections	Ceragenin CSA-13 is a synthetic mimic of cationic antibacterial peptides, with facial amphiphilic morphology reproduced using a cholic acid scaffold. Previous data have shown that this molecule displays broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which decreases in the presence of blood plasma. However, at higher concentrations, CSA-13 can cause lysis of erythrocytes. This study was designed to assess in vitro antibacterial and haemolytic activity of CSA-13 in the presence of pluronic F-127. CSA-13 bactericidal activity against clinical strains of bacteria associated with topical infections and in an experimental setting relevant to their pathophysiological environment, such as various epithelial tissue fluids and the airway sputum of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF), was evaluated using minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) measurements and bacterial killing assays. We found that in the presence of pluronic F-127, CSA-13 antibacterial activity was only slightly decreased, but CSA-13 haemolytic activity was significantly inhibited. CSA-13 exhibits bacterial killing activity against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa present in CF sputa, and biofilms formed by different Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria. CSA-13 bactericidal action is partially compromised in the presence of plasma, but is maintained in ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The synergistic action of CSA-13, determined by the use of a standard checkerboard assay, reveals an increase in CSA-13 antibacterial activity in the presence of host defence molecules such as the cathelicidin LL-37 peptide, lysozyme, lactoferrin and secretory phospholipase A (sPLA). These results suggest that CSA-13 may be useful to prevent and treat topical infection. Combined application of CSA-13 with pluronic F-127 may be beneficial by reducing CSA-13 toxicity.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21030607	Physiological relevance of cell-specific distribution patterns of CFTR, NKCC1, NBCe1, and NHE3 along the crypt-villus axis in the intestine	We examined the cell-specific subcellular expression patterns for sodium- and potassium-coupled chloride (NaK2Cl) cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), Na(+) bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) to understand the functional plasticity and synchronization of ion transport functions along the crypt-villus axis and its relevance to intestinal disease. In the unstimulated intestine, all small intestinal villus enterocytes coexpressed apical CFTR and NHE3, basolateral NBCe1, and mostly intracellular NKCC1. All (crypt and villus) goblet cells strongly expressed basolateral NKCC1 (at approximately three-fold higher levels than villus enterocytes), but no CFTR, NBCe1, or NHE3. Lower crypt cells coexpressed apical CFTR and basolateral NKCC1, but no NHE3 or NBCe1 (except NBCe1-expressing proximal colonic crypts). CFTR, NBCe1, and NKCC1 colocalized with markers of early and recycling endosomes, implicating endocytic recycling in cell-specific anion transport. Brunner's glands of the proximal duodenum coexpressed high levels of apical/subapical CFTR and basolateral NKCC1, but very low levels of NBCe1, consistent with secretion of Cl(-)-enriched fluid into the crypt. The cholinergic agonist carbachol rapidly (within 10 min) reduced cell volume along the entire crypt/villus axis and promoted NHE3 internalization into early endosomes. In contrast, carbachol induced membrane recruitment of NKCC1 and CFTR in all crypt and villus enterocytes, NKCC1 in all goblet cells, and NBCe1 in all villus enterocytes. These observations support regulated vesicle traffic in Cl(-) secretion by goblet cells and Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) secretion by villus enterocytes during the transient phase of cholinergic stimulation. Overall, the carbachol-induced membrane trafficking profile of the four ion transporters supports functional plasticity of the small intestinal villus epithelium that enables it to conduct both absorptive and secretory functions.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21038076	Effect of cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype on voriconazole exposure in cystic fibrosis lung transplant patients	Voriconazole is widely used to treat invasive aspergillosis after lung transplantation. In cystic fibrosis patients, the interindividual variability in drug disposition complicates the optimal voriconazole dosing and increases the risk of toxicity. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the influence of CYP2C19 genotype on voriconazole response in lung transplant patients with cystic fibrosis. We retrospectively studied 24 Caucasian cystic fibrosis lung transplant recipients who received voriconazole. We analyzed the influence of CYP2C19 genotype (_2 and _17 alleles) on voriconazole exposure and maintenance dose and side effects. Heterozygous carriers of the CYP2C19_2-deficient allele required lower maintenance doses (440 ± 107 mg/day) compared with wild-type and CYP2C19_17-allele carriers (633 ± 197 mg/day and 600 ± 193 mg/day, respectively, P<0.05). The time to achieve the therapeutic range and the proportion of out-of-range concentrations were significantly higher in the CYP2C19_2 group (31.3% vs. 12.1% and 9.8% of above-range levels in the CYP2C19_1 and CYP2C19_17 groups, respectively) or CYP2C19_17 group (37.9% vs. 15.6% and 13% of below-range levels in the CYP2C19_1 and CYP2C19_2 groups, respectively) (P<0.01). No relationship was found between voriconazole toxicity and CYP2C19 status. In this frail population, voriconazole exposure is strongly influenced by CYP2C19 genotype, and determining the genotype before voriconazole initiation may help determine the initial dosing regimen that will promptly achieve therapeutic plasma levels without producing out-of-range levels.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21073547	Levofloxacin reduces inflammatory cytokine levels in human bronchial epithelia cells: implications for aerosol MP-376 (levofloxacin solution for inhalation) treatment of chronic pulmonary infections	Inflammation resulting from chronic bacterial infection in the lung contributes to long-term pulmonary complications in chronic pulmonary infections such as cystic fibrosis. Aerosol administration of levofloxacin as in the form of the investigational formulation MP-376 results in higher concentrations in lung tissues that are higher than those that can be attained with oral or intravenous dosing of levofloxacin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of high concentrations of levofloxacin achieved with aerosol administration of MP-376 on proinflammatory cytokine secretion by immortalized human bronchial epithelia cells in vitro. Additionally, we investigated the potential mechanisms of the immunomodulatory effect of levofloxacin. In vitro studies in human lung epithelial cell lines showed that levofloxacin led to a dose-related reduction in IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations, with 300 μg mL(-1) resulting in the reduction of levels of IL-6 by fourfold and IL-8 by twofold (P<0.05); in contrast, tobramycin increased IL-6 levels by 50%, but had no effect on IL-8. Levofloxacin treatment did not affect the cytokine mRNA level and nuclear factor-κB-dependent promoter activity. These findings suggest that high concentrations of levofloxacin obtained in pulmonary tissues following the administration of aerosol MP-376 may provide additional benefits in patients with chronic pulmonary infections that are independent of its antibacterial properties.	cystic fibrosis	0.3.

21146944	Uncovered primary seizure foci in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome after corpus callosotomy	Corpus callosotomy (CC) is a palliative surgical procedure to control atonic, tonic, or generalized tonic-clonic seizure in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Here, we report patients with LGS who underwent resective surgery, following CC better delineating the presumed seizure foci localized in one hemisphere. We retrospectively reviewed seven patients with LGS who underwent CC and subsequent cortical resection. The median follow-up duration after lobectomy was 20 months (range, 15-54 months) and three patients had follow-up periods over 24 months. The findings of video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, structural and functional neuroimagings were compared between pre- and post-CC. Four patients had Engel class I and one patient had Engel class II outcomes following cortical resection; post-CC, compared to pre-CC, showed better localized ictal/interictal epileptiform discharges in the unilateral frontal area in two patients, in the unilateral parieto-temporo-occipital areas in one patient and in the unilateral fronto-temporal areas in the remaining two patients. Two patients had Engel Class III outcome following cortical resection; post-CC EEG continued to show multifocal epileptiform discharges but predominantly arising from a unilateral frontal area. Following CC, positron emission tomography showed localized glucose hypometabolism of which location was concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in all patient. Similarly, ictal/interictal single photon emission computed tomography also showed localized abnormalities concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in five of the six patients. Pathological assessment revealed cortical dysplasia in six patients, whereas no pathological abnormality was found in the remaining patient, who obtained Engel Class I outcome following cortical resection. CC could change EEG findings, glucose metabolisms and cerebral blood flows, and it is sometimes helpful in delineating the primary seizure focus in patients with LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		319	Uncovered primary seizure foci in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome after corpus callosotomy. Corpus callosotomy (CC) is a palliative surgical procedure to control atonic, tonic, or generalized tonic-clonic seizure in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Here, we report patients with LGS who underwent resective surgery, following CC better delineating the presumed seizure foci localized in one hemisphere. We retrospectively reviewed seven patients with LGS who underwent CC and subsequent cortical resection. The median follow-up duration after lobectomy was 20 months (range, 15-54 months) and three patients had follow-up periods over 24 months. The findings of video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, structural and functional neuroimagings were compared between pre- and post-CC. Four patients had Engel class I and one patient had Engel class II outcomes following cortical resection; post-CC, compared to pre-CC, showed better localized ictal/interictal epileptiform discharges in the unilateral frontal area in two patients, in the unilateral parieto-temporo-occipital areas in one patient and in the unilateral fronto-temporal areas in the remaining two patients. Two patients had Engel Class III outcome following cortical resection; post-CC EEG continued to show multifocal epileptiform discharges but predominantly arising from a unilateral frontal area. Following CC, positron emission tomography showed localized glucose hypometabolism of which location was concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in all patient. Similarly, ictal/interictal single photon emission computed tomography also showed localized abnormalities concordant with post-CC EEG abnormalities in five of the six patients.

21204804	STXBP1 mutations cause not only Ohtahara syndrome but also West syndrome--result of Japanese cohort study	We performed STXBP1 mutation analyses in 86 patients with various types of epilepsies, including 10 patients with OS, 43 with West syndrome, 2 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 with symptomatic generalized epilepsy, 14 with symptomatic partial epilepsy, and 5 with other undetermined types of epilepsy. In all patients, the etiology was unknown, but ARX and CDKL5 mutations were negative in all cases. All coding exons of STXBP1 were analyzed by direct-sequencing. Two de novo nucleotide alterations of STXBP1 were identified in two patients with Ohtahara and West syndrome, respectively. No de novo or deleterious mutations in STXBP1 were found in the remaining 84 patients with various types of symptomatic epilepsies. This is the first case report showing that STXBP1 mutations caused West syndrome from the onset of epilepsy. STXBP1 analysis should be considered as an etiology of symptomatic West syndrome without explainable cause.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

21209785	A roadmap to the brittle bones of cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder which despite advances in medical care continues to be a life-limiting and often fatal disease. With increase in life expectancy of the CF population, bone disease has emerged as a common complication. Unlike the osteoporosis seen in postmenopausal population, bone disease in CF begins at a young age and is associated with significant morbidity due to fractures, kyphosis, increased pain, and decreased lung function. The maintenance of bone health is essential for the CF population during their lives to prevent pain and fractures but also as they approach lung transplantation since severe bone disease can lead to exclusion from lung transplantation. Early recognition, prevention, and treatment are key to maintaining optimal bone health in CF patients and often require a multidisciplinary approach. This article will review the pathophysiology, current clinical practice guidelines, and potential future therapies for treating CF-related bone disease.	cystic fibrosis			176	A roadmap to the brittle bones of cystic fibrosis.

Video-EEG/EKG monitoring prior to corpus callosotomy recorded consistent prolongation of the R-R interval on the EKG during bursts of epileptiform abnormalities (generalized paroxysmal fast activity), which became transiently more pronounced after surgery. These findings reveal that interictal epileptiform abnormalities may cause significant cardiac arrhythmias in some individuals.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

21243535	Cerebellar atrophy in a child with valproate toxicity	In the treatment of epilepsy, selecting an appropriate antiepileptic drug for each individual patient requires matching the patient's clinical needs with the agent's specific pharmacological attributes. In many situations, the final choice of an antiepileptic drug may need a change due to the agent's side-effect profile. The authors report a ten-year-old child with Lennox Gastaut syndrome who developed recurrence of seizures, hyperammonemic encephalopathy and cerebellar atrophy on valproate therapy. Valproate was discontinued and lamotrigine was added followed by good control of seizures. Cerebellar atrophy as a serious adverse side effect of valproate therapy, has been infrequently reported.

21256770	A prospective open-labeled trial with levetiracetam in pediatric epilepsy syndromes: continuous spikes and waves during sleep is definitely a target	Although LVT is currently extensively prescribed in childhood epilepsy, its effect on the panel of refractory epilepsy syndromes has not been entirely evaluated prospectively. **In order to study the efficacy and safety of LVT as adjunctive therapy according to syndromes, we included 102 patients with refractory seizures (6 months to 15 years) in a prospective open-labeled trial**. The responder rate was respectively 36% and 32% at 3 and 6 months with 6% and 7% patients becoming seizure free. Among the responders at 6 months (n=33), seizure frequency decreased by 66% and 79% at 3 and 6 months LVT compared to baseline. The highest benefit was for CSWS patients with 2/3 responders, 50% seizure free and no aggravation. LVT provided respectively 39% and 42% responders in focal and absence epilepsies. Infantile spasms and Dravet syndrome experienced the lowest efficacy. No patient with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was aggravated. LVT dose over 40 mg/kg/d was associated with a lower response rate. Tolerability was excellent. In spite of a small sample, we assume that CSWS is a good candidate for a randomized-controlled trial with LVT.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

21259449	Screening for symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis	Although studies have assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), few have been conducted since the advent of new medical treatments (e.g., nebulized antibiotics, ThAIRpy Vest). Study objectives were to: (1) document symptoms of depression and anxiety for adolescents and young adults with CF and compare with normative values, (2) examine the associations among depressive/anxiety symptoms and gender, age, lung function, and body mass index, and (3) determine the relations between adolescent and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patients and caregivers completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anytime (e.g., beginning or end) during routine CF clinic appointments. Participants included 59 adolescents/young adults with CF (M(age)  = 15.8 years, 54% female, 98% Caucasian, M(FEV1% predicted)  = 84.6) and caregivers of 40 adolescents. Although symptom scores were in the normative range for patients with CF (M(Depression)  = 2.27 and M(Anxiety)  = 5.59), 3% and 32% exhibited clinically elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with age (r = 0.28, 0.36). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were also positively correlated (r = 0.48). Females endorsed higher anxiety symptoms than males. While adolescent and caregiver anxiety scores were not related, higher caregiver depressive symptoms were associated with older patient age and worse lung function. Data from the current study suggest low levels of depressive symptoms and substantial levels of anxiety symptoms in adolescents and young adults with CF. Consistent with prior literature, depressive symptoms appear higher in older patients and are significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Caregiver symptomology appears to be more affected by an adolescent's health status, suggesting a need to screen caregivers when health begins to decline.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

21300824	CCL20/CCR6 feedback exaggerates epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent MUC5AC mucin production in human airway epithelial (NCI-H292) cells	Mucous hypersecretion is an important feature of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. Multiple stimuli induce mucin production via activation of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cascade, but the mechanisms that exaggerate mucin production in obstructive airway diseases remain unknown. In this study, we show that binding of CCL20, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand that is upregulated in the airways of subjects with obstructive airway diseases, to its unique GPCR CCR6 induces MUC5AC mucin production in human airway epithelial (NCI-H292) cells via metalloprotease TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent EGFR activation. We also show that EGFR activation by its potent ligand TGF-α induces reactivation of EGFR via binding of endogenously produced CCL20 to its receptor CCR6 in NCI-H292 cells but not in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, exaggerating mucin production in the NCI-H292 cells. In NCI-H292 cells, TGF-α stimulation induced two phases of EGFR phosphorylation (EGFR-P). The second EGFR-P was TACE-dependent and was responsible for most of the total mucin induced by TGF-α. Binding of endogenously produced CCL20 to CCR6 increased the second EGFR-P and subsequent mucin production induced by TGF-α. In NHBE cells, TGF-α-induced EGFR activation did not lead to significant CCL20 production or to EGFR rephosphorylation, and less mucin was produced. We conclude that NCI-H292 cells but not NHBE cells produce CCL20 in response to EGFR activation, which leads to a second phase of EGFR-P and subsequent exaggerated mucin production. These findings have potentially important therapeutic implications in obstructive airway diseases.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21324226	The skinny on tuna fat: health implications	Dietary n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) PUFA have significant implications in health and disease prevention. Marine life is rich in long-chain n-3 PUFA. Children and adults in North America are reluctant fish eaters; canned tuna is a common fish in children's diets. Although a multitude of tuna products are available, their respective PUFA contents have not been well described. The aim of the present study was to compare the fatty acid (FA) profiles of different commercially available US tuna products. Fat and FA composition of eight products randomly selected from two US suppliers were analysed with capillary GC after lipid extraction. Large north-eastern US grocery store chain. Canned tuna. Energy from fat varied from 3 to 33 % and the essential FA (EFA) linoleic acid (18 : 2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18 : 3n-3) varied tenfold. DHA varied between 90 and 770 mg/serving. The n-6:n-3 ratio was 3:1-4:1 in oil-packaged products, 2:1-7:1 in packaged tuna salads and 1:3-1:7 in water-packaged products. A similar magnitude of differences was seen in the ratio between arachidonic acid (20 : 4n-6) and DHA. Light tuna canned in water may be a better choice of providing n-3 PUFA to individuals in a healthy population, whereas oil-packaged products may be preferable for those individuals with a need for increased EFA, such as for patients with cystic fibrosis. Awareness regarding PUFA content may aid in consumer product choices and health-care provider advice.	cystic fibrosis			284	The skinny on tuna fat: health implications.

This paper intends to describe the syndrome in a patient with a history of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and a good response to treatment with levetiracetam (LEV). Descriptive study on the development of a 3 year old child with intrauterine asphyxia, multiorgan failure, metabolic acidosis, hypovolemic shock, and seizures with cerebral oedema, who developed a West syndrome, resistant to drug treatment. The semiology of seizures progressively changed to generalized episodes of hypertonia and myoclonus, with slow spike-wave electroencephalographic activity. With the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome the patient was treated with levetiracetam, showing a substantial improvement in the cognitive sphere, in the control of seizures, and electroencephalographic findings. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is one of the most severe epileptic syndromes in paediatric patients. Levetiracetam can help cognitive improvement, and contribute to seizure control in these patients.

21365309	Evaluation of algorithms for intracranial EEG (iEEG) source imaging of extended sources: feasibility of using iEEG source imaging for localizing epileptogenic zones in secondary generalized epilepsy	Precise identification of epileptogenic zones in patients with intractable drug-resistant epilepsy is critical for successful epilepsy surgery. Numerous source-imaging algorithms for localizing epileptogenic zones based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been developed and validated in simulation and experimental studies. Recently, intracranial EEG (iEEG)-based imaging of epileptogenic sources has attracted interest as a promising tool for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy; however, most iEEG studies have focused on localization of epileptogenic zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated whether iEEG source imaging is a useful supplementary tool for identifying extended epileptogenic sources in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). To this end, we applied four different cortical source imaging algorithms, namely minimum norm estimation (MNE), low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA (sLORETA), and L(p)-norm estimation (p = 1.5, referred to as Lp1.5), to artificial iEEG datasets generated assuming various source sizes and locations. We also applied these four algorithms to clinical ictal iEEG recordings acquired from a pediatric patient with LGS. Interestingly, the traditional MNE algorithm outperformed the other imaging algorithms in most of our experiments, particularly in cases when larger-sized sources were activated. Although sLORETA outperformed both LORETA and Lp1.5, its performance was not as good as that of MNE. Compared to the other algorithms, the performance of Lp1.5 decayed most rapidly as the source size increased. Our findings suggest that iEEG source imaging using MNE is a promising auxiliary tool for the identification of epileptogenic zones in secondary generalized epilepsy. We anticipate that our results will provide useful guidelines for selection of an appropriate imaging algorithm for iEEG source imaging studies.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

The first-line treatment option is valproate (VPA), usually in combination with lamotrigine. VPA has been linked to serious hepatotoxicity. We report a 22-year-old liver transplanted patient with LGS successfully treated with VPA in combination with phenobarbital (100 mg/d; blood level: 36 mg/l), lamotrigine (125 mg/d; blood level: 4.81 mg/l) and topiramtate (175 mg/d), as well as immunosuppressive, antiviral, anti-anemic, hypo-phosphoric and alkaline medication. On VPA 1000 mg/d, the seizure frequency decreased significantly. Taking into consideration the patient's good tolerance and the normal liver function, VPA was increased to 1500 mg/d. At this dose the daily drop attacks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures totally ceased. The patient presented only some tonic seizures around awakening. During many years, VPA was avoided in this patient because of its potential hepatotoxicity. However the good functioning of the transplanted liver permitted its introduction. VPA can be used safely in liver transplanted patients under the strict control of the hepatic function.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

Weight, height and pulmonary inflammation and infection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were assessed shortly after diagnosis in infants with CF and again at 1, 2 and 3 years of age. Body mass index (BMI) was expressed as z-scores. Inflammatory cells and cytokines (interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)), free neutrophil elastase activity and myeloperoxidase were measured in BAL. Mixed effects modelling was used to assess longitudinal associations between pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary infection (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and BMI z-score after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Forty-two infants were studied (16 (38%) male; 39 (93%) pancreatic insufficient); 36 were diagnosed by newborn screening (at median age 4 weeks) and six by early clinical diagnosis (meconium ileus). Thirty-one (74%) received antistaphylococcal antibiotics. More than two-thirds were asymptomatic at each assessment. Mean BMI z-scores were -1.5 at diagnosis and 0.5, -0.2 and -0.1 at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Neutrophil elastase and infection with S aureus were associated with lower BMI, whereas age (p=0.01) and antistaphylococcal antibiotics (p=0.013) were associated with increased BMI. On average, each log(10) increase in free neutrophil elastase activity was associated with a 0.43 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.79) reduction in BMI z-score. Early nutritional status is associated with the underlying pulmonary pathophysiology in CF, and better understanding of these relationships is required. Studies are required to assess whether interventions can decrease pulmonary inflammation and improve nutrition. Early surveillance will enable such targeted interventions with the aim of improving these important clinical outcomes.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

21420082	Abnormally enhanced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated apoptosis in endometrial cells contributes to impaired embryo implantation in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation	To investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)-induced supraphysiologic concentration of E2 on the endometrium and outcome of embryo implantation. Prospective experimental study. University-based laboratory. Imprinting control region female mice, 8-10 weeks old with regular estrous cycles. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at noon followed by an additional injection of 10 IU hCG 48 hours later. Uteri were collected from either superovulated or control mice (natural cycle) the morning after hCG administration on day 4 to evaluate and count blastocysts. A mouse blastocyst-endometrium coculture model was used to evaluate blastocyst adhesion to control or COH-treated endometrium. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression was determined by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and apoptosis determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay in both natural cycle and COH cycle endometrium. Primary culture of mouse endometrial epithelial cells was established to further determine the effects of various concentrations of E2 on apoptosis. We demonstrated that COH had adverse effects on blastocyst adhesion. In addition, COH endometrium exhibited an aberrant up-regulation of CFTR expression and a higher apoptotic rate compared with normal endometrium during the implantation period. Administration of exogenous supraphysiologic concentration of E2 to primary mouse endometrial epithelial cells mimicked the COH-induced up-regulation of CFTR and apoptosis observed in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of CFTR activity abrogated E2-induced apoptosis. The COH-induced supraphysiologic concentration of E2 aberrantly up-regulates CFTR, which leads to increased apoptosis in endometrial epithelial cells, resulting in impaired embryo implantation.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21422040	Lung Clearance Index and HRCT are complementary markers of lung abnormalities in young children with CF	High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a more sensitive tool for detecting early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease than either spirometry or plain radiography, but its relationship to other measures of lung function has not been established in young children. (1) To assess whether the lung clearance index (LCI) derived from multiple breath inert-gas washout (MBW) is as effective as HRCT in identifying pulmonary abnormalities; and (2) explore the relationships between abnormalities detected by HRCT and by spirometry, plethysmography and MBW (collectively, LFTs) in young children with CF. Children with CF underwent LFTs and volumetric HRCT on the same day. Healthy age-matched controls underwent identical LFTs without HRCT. Scans were anonymised, and scored using the Brody-II CT scoring system, to assess for presence and extent of bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening, mucus plugging, and parenchymal opacities. Assessments were undertaken in 60 children with CF (mean (SD) 7.8 (1.3 years) and 54 healthy controls (7.9 (1.2) y). Among children with CF, 84% (47/56) had abnormal LCI, 58% (27/47) abnormal plethysmographic lung volumes (FRC(pleth) or RV), 35% (21/60) abnormal sRaw and 47% (28/60) abnormal spirometry (FEV1 or FEF(25-75)); whereas HRCT scans were abnormal in 85% (51/60): median total Brody-II score: 9.5% (range 0-51%). Total CT score correlated more strongly with LCI (Spearman correlation = 0.77) than with spirometry (R = -0.43) or any other marker of lung function. Of the nine children with normal LCI, five had abnormalities on HRCT, whereas five children with normal HRCT had raised LCI. These results suggest that while LCI and HRCT have similar sensitivity to detect CF lung disease, complimentary information may be gained in individual patients.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

21484125	Successful liver transplantation for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, a single centre experience	BACKROUNDS/PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Weber-Osler is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasia that may affect the nose, skin, lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Liver involvement of the disease has been described to be responsible of biliary tract necrosis, high cardiac output and portal hypertension, due to intra-hepatic vascular shunts. We aimed to present four cases of successful orthotopic liver transplantations in this indication performing our modified Piggy-back technique. Between 2002 and 2008, four patients have been diagnosed for Rendu-Weber-Osler disease and underwent liver transplantation. Three of them suffered from high cardiac output with heart failure, two presented HBV infection and one patient suffered from renal failure requiring a liver-kidney transplantation. We performed our modified Piggy-back technique for liver implantation, which consists to clamp selectively the hepatic veins during the hepatectomy, without venous bypass, the retro-hepatic vena cava is preserved. No hemodynamic concerns disturbed the surgery and no massive transfusions were needed. The liver replacement corrected the cardiac insufficiency due to high cardiac output for the three patients. At present, the four patients are getting well. Despite new advances in immunotherapy for the medical treatment of Rendu-Weber-Osler disease, liver transplantation remains the curative option for hepatic based-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

21507732	Assessment of CFTR function in homozygous R117H-7T subjects	R117H is a frequent missense mutation included in most CFTR mutation panels. However knowledge about the residual function of R117H-CFTR channels in cystic fibrosis-affected organs, e.g. airways, intestines and sweat glands is presently lacking. We evaluated clinical CF symptoms and assessed CFTR function by sweat tests, nasal potential difference and intestinal current measurements in 2 homozygous R117H individuals (7T variant). The CFTR activity in airways and intestine was within the normal range. However both individuals presented with a borderline sweat test and the male patient was infertile. The lack of impact of the R117H mutation on chloride secretion in intestine and nose contrasts with the ~80% loss of CFTR activity reported in patch clamp studies. Apparently CFTR activity is not rate-limiting for chloride secretion in both tissues at levels >20% of normal, or compensatory factors may operate that are absent in heterologous host cells in vitro.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

They defined epilepsy, clinical symptoms and paraclinic manifestations, in relation with the age of onset and prognostic determinants. The etiological classification included the symptomatic group, when it is identify a causal, cryptogenic without a cause and idiopathic when we only have hereditary antecedents and we do not know the cause. The treatment is based on type of seizures, experience and clinical evidence. But always is important and a need to know the adverse effects and how to use three antiepileptic drugs or more. The objective it is to describe the classification, a diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic guide. The more frequent epileptic syndromes included: the neonatal group with Ohtahara syndrome, and neonatal symptomatic seizures. Infant group included the West and Dravet syndromes, Lennox Gastaut syndrome, and brain absences. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and centre-temporal syndrome as the most representative. We classify in relation to anatomical localization and etiology. We need to know therapeutic dose, pharmacological interactions and contraindications of the antiepileptic drugs.

21562128	Hemolytic phospholipase C inhibition protects lung function during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection	The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes both acute and chronic lung infections and is particularly problematic in patients with cystic fibrosis and those undergoing mechanical ventilation. Decreased lung function contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality during P. aeruginosa infection, and damage inflicted by P. aeruginosa virulence factors contributes to lung function decline. We sought to describe direct contribution of a bacterial phospholipase C/sphingomyelinase, PlcHR, to alteration of host lung physiology and characterize a potential therapeutic for protection of lung function. We infected C57Bl/6 mice with P. aeruginosa wild-type or isogenic plcHR deletion strains and measured lung function using computer-controlled ventilators. For in vivo testing, miltefosine was delivered intraperitoneally 1 hour after infection. Infection and respiratory endpoints were at 24 hours after infection. P. aeruginosa wild-type infection caused significant lung function impairment, whereas the effects of a ΔplcHR strain infection were much less severe. Surfactometry analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated that PlcHR decreased pulmonary surfactant function. Miltefosine has structural similarity to the PC and sphingomyelin substrates of PlcHR, and we found that it inhibits the cleavage of these choline-containing lipids in vitro. Miltefosine administration after P. aeruginosa infection limited the negative effects of PlcHR activity on lung function. We have directly linked production of a single virulence factor in P. aeruginosa with effects on lung function, and demonstrated that the inhibitor miltefosine protects lung function from PlcHR-dependent surfactant dysfunction.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21620114	Severe mixed sleep apnea after bilateral lung transplantation in a cystic fibrosis patient: a case report	Lung transplantation is the only treatment for end-stage lung disease in selected patients. After lung transplantation, patient recovery is often slow owing to severe underlying diseases in the patient producing hypoxemia before, during, and after surgery, as well as infections and rejection episodes. Postoperative breathing and ventillatory disorders are also associated with diaphragmatic dysfunction and/or phrenic nerve damage. Herein we have reported a case of a 35-year-old man undergoing bilateral lung transplantation owing to worsening of chronic respiratory failure from cystic fibrosis. After uncomplicated surgery, weaning was delayed due to nighttime dyspnea and hypoxemia attributed to diaphragm dysfunction. After improvement of diaphragm function, the symptoms persisted, requiring noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support. Polysomnography confirmed severe mixed sleep apnea. Effective treatment with noninvasive bi-level positive airway pressure spontaneous/timed mode (BiPAP S/T) ventilation during the nights rendered the patient symptom free. Polysomnography confirmed successful treatment. Disordered breathing while sleeping is common after solid organ transplantation. BiPAP S/T ventilator therapy was effective to the treat dominantly central sleep apnea in our patient.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

21692791	A retrospective population-based study on seizures related to childhood vaccination	Cases of severe childhood epilepsies in temporal association with vaccination have great impact on the acceptance of vaccination programs by parents and health care providers. However, little is known about the type and frequency of seizures and epilepsy syndromes following vaccination. This study aims to describe the clinical features of children presenting with seizures after vaccination using a register-based cohort. We surveyed the national German database of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for reported seizures and epilepsies in children aged 0-6 years. All cases reported in 2006-2008 were analyzed retrospectively; available clinical information was reevaluated and classified by seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. In total, 328 cases reported between 2006 and 2008 were included. Data supportive of seizures or epilepsy were present in 247 (75.3%) of 328 patients with a mean interval between the vaccination and the epileptic event of 24 h and 7.5 days for inactivated and attenuated vaccines, respectively. Fifty-one (15.5%) of 328 patients presented with syncope, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, or other nonepileptic events. Information was insufficient for classification into epileptic versus nonepileptic events in 30 (11.3%) of 328 patients. For cases with confirmed seizures, febrile seizures were present in 121 (49%) of 247 cases, and 38 (15.4%) of 247 patients had single afebrile seizures. Status epilepticus was described in 21 (8.5%) of 247 patients. Thirty-one (12.6%) of 247 patients presented with various pediatric epilepsy syndromes. Severe childhood epilepsies (Dravet syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or Doose syndrome) were diagnosed in 29 (11.7%) of 247 patients, with the vaccination-associated event being the first documented seizure in 15 (51.7%) of 29 patients. Vaccination-associated seizures present in the setting of various epilepsy syndromes, including severe childhood epilepsies in >10% of cases. Early diagnosis of the corresponding epilepsy syndromes and confirmation of an underlying etiology is important for treatment decisions, genetic counseling, and public health evaluation of vaccine safety.

Cases of severe childhood epilepsies in temporal association with vaccination have great impact on the acceptance of vaccination programs by parents and health care providers. However, little is known about the type and frequency of seizures and epilepsy syndromes following vaccination. This study aims to describe the clinical features of children presenting with seizures after vaccination using a register-based cohort. We surveyed the national German database of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for reported seizures and epilepsies in children aged 0-6 years. All cases reported in 2006-2008 were analyzed retrospectively; available clinical information was reevaluated and classified by seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. In total, 328 cases reported between 2006 and 2008 were included. Data supportive of seizures or epilepsy were present in 247 (75.3%) of 328 patients with a mean interval between the vaccination and the epileptic event of 24 h and 7.5 days for inactivated and attenuated vaccines, respectively. Fifty-one (15.5%) of 328 patients presented with syncope, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, or other nonepileptic events. Information was insufficient for classification into epileptic versus nonepileptic events in 30 (11.3%) of 328 patients. For cases with confirmed seizures, febrile seizures were present in 121 (49%) of 247 cases, and 38 (15.4%) of 247 patients had single afebrile seizures. Status epilepticus was described in 21 (8.5%) of 247 patients. Thirty-one (12.6%) of 247 patients presented with various pediatric epilepsy syndromes. Severe childhood epilepsies (Dravet syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or Doose syndrome) were diagnosed in 29 (11.7%) of 247 patients, with the vaccination-associated event being the first documented seizure in 15 (51.7%) of 29 patients. Vaccination-associated seizures present in the setting of various epilepsy syndromes, including severe childhood epilepsies in >10% of cases. Early diagnosis of the corresponding epilepsy syndromes and confirmation of an underlying etiology is important for treatment decisions, genetic counseling, and public health evaluation of vaccine safety.
21740592	Stroke in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients. New evidence for repeated screening and early treatment of pulmonary vascular malformations: two case reports	Paradoxical embolism due to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is the main mechanism of brain infarction in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. International Guidelines have recently been published to clarify the performance of screening tests and the effectiveness of treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We present two cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients of our hospital who experienced an acute stroke secondary to paradoxical embolism. These two cases show that the guidelines must be followed to prevent the occurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and that although they may be adequate in most cases, there are some patients who need a more personalized approach.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

21764776	ChIP-seq reveals cell type-specific binding patterns of BMP-specific Smads and a novel binding motif	Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are implicated in human genetic disorders. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of Smad1/5 binding sites in ECs and PASMCs. Smad1/5 preferentially bound to the region outside the promoter of known genes, and the binding was associated with target gene upregulation. Cell-selective Smad1/5 binding patterns appear to be determined mostly by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns. We identified, for the first time, a Smad1/5 binding motif in mammals, and termed GC-rich Smad binding element (GC-SBE). Several sequences in the identified GC-SBE motif had relatively weak affinity for Smad binding, and were enriched in cell type-specific Smad1/5 binding regions. We also found that both GC-SBE and the canonical SBE affect binding affinity for the Smad complex. Furthermore, we characterized EC-specific Smad1/5 target genes and found that several Notch signaling pathway-related genes were induced by BMP in ECs. Among them, a Notch ligand, JAG1 was regulated directly by Smad1/5, transactivating Notch signaling in the neighboring cells. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of BMP signaling and the pathogenesis of vascular lesions of certain genetic disorders, including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

21779371	PAD4-mediated neutrophil extracellular trap formation is not required for immunity against influenza infection	During an inflammatory response, neutrophils migrate to the site of infection where they can kill invading pathogens by phagocytosis, secretion of anti-microbicidal mediators or the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are specialized anti-microbial structures comprised of decondensed chromatin decorated with microbicidal agents. Increased amount of NETs have been found in patients suffering from the chronic lung inflammatory disease cystic fibrosis, correlating with increased severity of pulmonary obstruction. Furthermore, acute lung inflammation during influenza A infection is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils into the lung. The role of NETs during virus-mediated lung inflammation is unknown. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated deimination of histone H3 and H4 is required for NET formation. Therefore, we generated a PAD4-deficient mouse strain that has a striking inability to form NETs. These mice were infected with influenza A/WSN, and the disease was monitored at the level of leukocytic lung infiltration, lung pathology, viral replication, weight loss and mortality. PAD4 KO fared comparable to WT mice in all the parameters tested, but they displayed slight but statistically different weight loss kinetics during infection that was not reflected in enhanced survival. Overall, we conclude that PAD4-mediated NET formation is dispensable in a mouse model of influenza A infection.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21790560	Definition and natural history of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy with a peak age of onset of 3-5 years of age. Reported prevalence rates for LGS vary widely from 1-10% of all childhood epilepsies. Incidence rates are much lower. LGS is characterized by intractable, multiple, generalized seizure types and an interictal electroencephalogram showing bursts of slow spike-and-wave, paroxysmal bursts of generalized polyspikes, and a slow background. All patients have tonic seizures during sleep that may be subtle, and nearly all have treatment-resistant, lifelong epilepsy. Cognitive stagnation and behavioral problems are seen in almost all patients and lead to a life of dependency. The differential diagnosis includes other symptomatic generalized epilepsies and pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Misdiagnosis is common. Children and adults with LGS have an enormous impact on their families, and efforts to improve the quality of life for these patients are complex.

21790562	Strategies for transitioning to adult care for youth with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and related disorders	Transition is the process of preparing children with chronic illness and their families for the adult health care system. In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and related disorders, the process of transition is complicated by the presence of intellectual handicap, treatment-resistant epilepsy, and behavioral issues. Patients who are not successfully transitioned to adult care may end up without specialty care, may not receive satisfactory adult services, may lack adequate follow-up and access to newer therapies, and may lack appropriate management of comorbid conditions. Several family related and clinician-related barriers can inhibit the transition process. Transition strategies that maximize each patient's ability to achieve his or her potential and optimize self-sufficiency may lead to better social outcomes. Adolescent clinics that include members of the pediatric and adult neurology teams may help ensure a smooth transition to adult care, although studies are needed to objectively establish the best model. Results are reported from a survey of 133 symposium attendees on the topic of practice characteristics and issues related to transitioning care. Results suggested a great deal of dissatisfaction about the process of transition, especially for patients with intellectual handicap. We provide suggestions for developing a transition program, including identifying a willing adult service, adapting a multidisciplinary approach, addressing legal and psychosocial issues, and celebrating rites of passage.

21792306	Update on rufinamide in childhood epilepsy	Rufinamide is an orally active, structurally novel compound (1-[(2,6-difluorophenil1) methyl1]-1 hydro 1,2,3-triazole-4 carboxamide), which is structurally distinct from other anticonvulsant drugs. It was granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in the United States in 2004, and released for use in Europe in 2007. In January 2009, rufinamide was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of LGS in children 4 years of age and older. It is also approved for adjunctive treatment for partial seizures in adults and adolescents. Rufinamide's efficacy mainly against atonic/tonic seizures in patients with LGS seems nowadays indubitable and has been confirmed both in randomized controlled trial and in open label extension studies. More recently, rufinamide was evaluated for the adjunctive treatment of childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathies and epileptic syndromes other than LGS, including epileptic spasms, multifocal epileptic encephalopathy with spasm/tonic seizures, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy. This review updates the existing literature data on the efficacy and safety/tolerability of rufinamide in childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes.

21816895	Epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia treated with selective arterial embolization	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare systemic fibrovascular dysplasia also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. Epistaxis is often the first and foremost symptom of the disease and recurrent epistaxis is the main complaint. **Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of endovascular treatment of epistaxis in HHT patients.** Between June 2004 and January 2008, 14 patients with HHT underwent embolization of external carotid artery (ECA) branches **due to severe epistaxis**. There were eight men and six women aged 27-42 years. Patients were referred for endovascular treatment when primary management with electrocautery and nasal packing was ineffective. Arteries suspected of bleeding were catheterized super-selectively with micro-catheters to perform embolization. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA) or embospheres in diameter of 500-700-µm were used as an embolic material. Embolization was technically successful in 11 (78.5%) patients. Immediate, complete control of bleeding was achieved in 12 (85%) patients. During long-term follow-up recurrent nasal bleeding occurred in six (43%) patients 6-24 months after treatment. There were no severe complications after embolization. Nine patients experienced mild facial pain which resolved within three days after the treatment. Three patients in whom arterial spasm was observed, suffered from facial paraesthesia lasting for 3-5 days after embolization. Out of 14 patients, 12 were available for 24-month follow-up evaluation. All except one claimed reduction in frequency and severity of epistaxis which had a positive impact on their quality of life. **Endovascular embolization of epistaxis in patients with HHT is an effective and safe procedure although it cannot provide a long-term cure in most cases.

21829484	Culture enriched molecular profiling of the cystic fibrosis airway microbiome	The microbiome of the respiratory tract, including the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal microbiota, is a dynamic community of microorganisms that is highly diverse. The cystic fibrosis (CF) airway microbiome refers to the polymicrobial communities present in the lower airways of CF patients. It is comprised of chronic opportunistic pathogens (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a variety of organisms derived mostly from the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract. The complexity of these communities has been inferred primarily from culture independent molecular profiling. As with most microbial communities it is generally assumed that most of the organisms present are not readily cultured. Our culture collection generated using more extensive cultivation approaches, reveals a more complex microbial community than that obtained by conventional CF culture methods. To directly evaluate the cultivability of the airway microbiome, we examined six samples in depth using culture-enriched molecular profiling which combines culture-based methods with the molecular profiling methods of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We demonstrate that combining culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches enhances the sensitivity of either approach alone. Our techniques were able to cultivate 43 of the 48 families detected by deep sequencing; the five families recovered solely by culture-independent approaches were all present at very low abundance (<0.002% total reads). 46% of the molecular signatures detected by culture from the six patients were only identified in an anaerobic environment, suggesting that a large proportion of the cultured airway community is composed of obligate anaerobes. Most significantly, using 20 growth conditions per specimen, half of which included anaerobic cultivation and extended incubation times we demonstrate that the majority of bacteria present can be cultured.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21855727	Cutaneous signs of systemic disease	Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathonemonic. They include, on the nails, Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines), Beau's lines, Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and half and half nails, often associated, respectively, with arsenic poisoning, acute stress or systemic illness, severe hypertension, liver disease and uremia, and, around the nails, Braverman's sign, associated with collagen-vascular disease. Elsewhere, one may see the Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity. Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis. Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis. A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease. Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola. Fitzpatrick's sign is indicative of a benign lesion (dermatofibroma), whereas Hutchinson's sign is indicative of a malignant one (subungual melanoma). Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma. Palpable purpura is indicative of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which must be diagnosed and treated early. Hyperpigmentation of areolae and scars is seen in Addison's disease. Acanthosis nigricans may indicate internal cancer, especially stomach cancer, whereas Bazex's syndrome occurs in synchrony with primary, usually squamous cancer, in the upper aerodigestive tract or metastatic cancer in cervical lymph nodes. Perioral pigmented macules or one or more cutaneous sebaceous neoplasms may be a sign of the Peutz-Jeghers or Muir-Torre syndrome, respectively, both associated also with intestinal polyps that have a malignant potential. Telangiectasiae in the perioral region may be associated with similar lesions internally in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Kerr's sign is indicative of spinal cord injury and Darier's sign of mastocytosis. Post proctoscopic periobital purpura (PPPP) is a phenomenon observed in some patients with systemic amyloidosis. Koebner's isomorphic response refers to the tendency of an established dermatosis, such as psoriasis, to arise in (a) site(s) of trauma, whereas Wolf's isotrophic response refers to a new dermatosis, such as tinea, not yet seen in the patient, arising in (a) site(s) of a former but different dermatosis, such as zoster.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			510	... signs, indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases, Auspitz's sign, a classic finding in psoriasis, Borsieri's and Pasita's signs, seen in early scarlet fever, the butterfly rash, indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the buffalo hump, seen in Cushing's disease and also in the more common corticosteroid toxicity.

21862354	An atypical case of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome not associated with mental retardation: a nosological issue	The characteristic electroclinical features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have been extensively reported, but the influence of the constellation of slow spike-and-wave (SSW) complexes with multiple seizure types (including atypical absence seizures [AAS] and tonic seizures [TS]) on patients with this syndrome is still unclear. We report the case of a 28-year-old woman who developed AAS and brief asymmetric TS at the age of 14 years. Her seizure disorder met diagnostic criteria for LGS (SSW on electroencephalogram and multiple seizure types), but there was no intellectual impairment and an interictal alpha EEG. Even 14 years after the onset of her epilepsy, she maintained fairly normal cognitive function, although she was bothered by frequent brief and subtle episodes of AAS and TS.

21955319	Respiratory viruses in children with cystic fibrosis: viral detection and clinical findings	Viral detection from different respiratory sample types in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is facilitated by available molecular methods, but optimum sampling strategies have not been identified. In addition, associations between viral detection and respiratory symptoms are not well described. Study goals were to compare molecular detection of viruses from concurrent upper airway and sputum samples in children with CF and to describe relative frequency of respiratory viral infections and identify potential clinical associations. We conducted a 2-year prospective surveillance study in 44 children with CF aged 6-18 years. Upper airway and sputum samples were collected quarterly and during pulmonary exacerbations and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses types 1-4, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. Physical exams and symptom surveys were used to identify respiratory signs and symptoms. Upper airway samples were collected at 359 visits; concordance of PCR-based viral detection was examined in a subset of paired upper airway and sputum samples from 21 participants at 92 visits. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus (23·1% overall), and rhinovirus detection was the same for both sample types (21·7% each). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of rhinovirus in sputum relative to upper airway sampling were 70% and 91·7%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms associated with rhinovirus detection included increased cough, increased nasal congestion, increased sputum production, and wheezing. A relatively high frequency of rhinovirus detection was observed by either upper airway or sputum samples, and clinical findings suggest a significant-associated symptom burden.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

21956725	Randomized, phase III study results of clobazam in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	To evaluate efficacy and safety of clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, as adjunctive therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Patients aged 2-60 years were randomized to placebo or clobazam 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg/day. Study consisted of 4-week baseline, 3-week titration, and 12-week maintenance phases, followed by a 2- or 3-week taper or continuation in an open-label extension. Primary endpoint was percentage decrease in mean weekly drop seizure rates during maintenance vs baseline phases for modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. Secondary outcomes included other seizure types, responder rates, and physicians' and caregivers' global assessments. A total of 305 patients were screened, 238 were randomized, and 217 composed the mITT population. Of patients enrolled after a protocol amendment, 125/157 (79.6%) completed. Average weekly drop seizure rates decreased 12.1% for placebo vs 41.2% (p = 0.0120), 49.4% (p = 0.0015), and 68.3% (p < 0.0001) for the clobazam 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg/day groups. Responder rates (≥50%) were 31.6% (placebo) vs 43.4% (p = 0.3383), 58.6% (p = 0.0159), and 77.6% (p < 0.0001) for clobazam 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg/day groups. Physicians' and caregivers' assessments indicated clobazam significantly improved symptoms. Somnolence, pyrexia, upper respiratory infections, and lethargy were the most frequent adverse events reported for clobazam. Clobazam significantly decreased weekly drop seizure rates in LGS. No new safety signals were identified. This study provides Class II evidence that clobazam as adjunctive therapy is efficacious, in a dosage-dependent manner, in reducing mean weekly drop seizure rates of patients with LGS over 12 weeks.

21966295	Immunopathology and immunogenetics of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis	Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a Th2 hypersensitivity lung disease in response to Aspergillus fumigatus that affects asthmatic and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Sensitization to A. fumigatus is common in both atopic asthmatic and CF patients, yet only 1%-2% of asthmatic and 7%-9% of CF patients develop ABPA. ABPA is characterized by wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates which may lead to pulmonary fibrosis and/or bronchiectasis. The inflammatory response is characterized by Th2 responses to Aspergillus allergens, increased serum IgE, and eosinophilia. A number of genetic risks have recently been identified in the development of ABPA. These include HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4RA) polymorphisms, IL-10 -1082GA promoter polymorphisms, surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) polymorphisms, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations. The studies indicate that ABPA patients are genetically at risk to develop skewed and heightened Th2 responses to A. fumigatus antigens. These genetic risk studies and their consequences of elevated biologic markers may aid in identifying asthmatic and CF patients who are at risk to the development of ABPA. Furthermore, these studies suggest that immune modulation with medications such as anti-IgE, anti-IL-4, and/or IL-13 monoclonal antibodies may be helpful in the treatment of ABPA.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

21984237	Characterization of the poly-β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide component of Burkholderia biofilms	We demonstrated the production of poly-β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) polysaccharide in the biofilms of Burkholderia multivorans, Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Burkholderia ambifaria, Burkholderia cepacia, and Burkholderia cenocepacia using an immunoblot assay for PNAG. These results were confirmed by further studies, which showed that the PNAG hydrolase, dispersin B, eliminated immunoreactivity of extracts from the species that were tested (B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans). Dispersin B also inhibited biofilm formation and dispersed preformed biofilms of Burkholderia species. These results imply a role for PNAG in the maintenance of Burkholderia biofilm integrity. While PNAG was present in biofilms of all of the wild-type test organisms, a ΔpgaBC mutant of B. multivorans (Mu5) produced no detectable PNAG, indicating that these genes are needed for Burkholderia PNAG formation. Furthermore, restoration of PNAG production in PNAG negative E. coli TRXWMGΔC (ΔpgaC) by complementation with B. multivorans pgaBCD confirmed the involvement of these genes in Burkholderia PNAG production. While the confocal scanning laser microscopy of untreated wild-type B. multivorans showed thick, multilayered biofilm, Mu5 and dispersin B-treated wild-type biofilms were thin, poorly developed, and disrupted, confirming the involvement of PNAG in B. multivorans biofilm formation. Thus, PNAG appears to be an important component of Burkholderia biofilms, potentially contributing to its resistance to multiple antibiotics and persistence during chronic infections, including cystic fibrosis-associated infection.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22059807	Acute intratracheal Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis mice is age-independent	Since the discovery of the human CFTR gene in 1989 various mouse models for cystic fibrosis (CF) have been generated and used as a very suitable and popular tool to approach research on this life-threatening disease. Age related changes regarding the course of disease and susceptibility towards pulmonary infections have been discussed in numerous studies. Here, we investigated CftrTgH(neoim)Hgu and Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J CF mice and their non-CF littermates during an acute lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for age dependent effects of their lung function and immune response.Mice younger than three or older than six months were intratracheally infected with P. aeruginosa TBCF10839. The infection was monitored by lung function of the animals using non-invasive head-out spirometry and the time course of physiological parameters over 192 hours. Quantitative bacteriology and lung histopathology of a subgroup of animals were used as endpoint parameters. Age-dependent changes in lung function and characteristic features for CF like a shallower, faster breathing pattern were observed in both CF mouse models in uninfected state. In contrast infected CF mice did not significantly differ from their non-CF littermates in susceptibility and severity of lung infection in both mouse models and age groups. The transgenic Cftrtm1Unc-Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J and their non-CF littermates showed a milder course of infection than the CftrTgH(neoim)Hgu CF and their congenic C57Bl/6J non-CF mice suggesting that the genetic background was more important for outcome than Cftr dysfunction. Previous investigations of the same mouse lines have shown a higher airway susceptibility of older CF mice to intranasally applied P. aeruginosa. The different outcome of intranasal and intratracheal instillation of bacteria implies that infected CF epithelium is impaired during the initial colonization of upper airways, but not in the subsequent response of host defense.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22070931	Absence of the lectin activation pathway of complement does not increase susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections	Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains one of the major clinical pathogens that burden immuno-compromised patients and patients with cystic fibrosis. The present study aimed to define the role of the lectin pathway of complement in the immune-defence against P. aeruginosa in a mouse model of invasive pneumonia. Using in vitro assays specific for each of the three complement pathways, we demonstrate that some strains of P. aeruginosa bind lectin pathway recognition sub-components and initiate complement activation in a lectin pathway-specific mode. All of the tested strains activated complement via classical and alternative pathways. We assessed the importance of lectin pathway activation in fighting P. aeruginosa infections by testing a lectin pathway activating strain in a mouse model of intra-nasal infection. MASP-2 (mannan binding lectin associated serine protease-2) deficient mice, which have no lectin pathway activity, had no significant survival disadvantage compared to wild type littermates (72.7% and 81.8% survival, respectively, p=0.48). Likewise, no difference in opsonising activity was seen between MASP-2 sufficient and MASP-2 deficient mouse sera. Moreover, cytokine expression profiles in the lungs of WT mice and MASP-2-/- mice were similar throughout the course of P. aeruginosa infection. We conclude that the lectin pathway does not play an essential role in fighting P. aeruginosa infection in mice.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22071552	Localization of ictal onset zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) based on information theoretical time delay analysis of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)	Precise localization of ictal onset zones is of great clinical importance for successful surgery in patients with intractable drug-resistant epilepsy. Time delay analysis has been one of the most reliable and most widely used computational electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis methods for localizing ictal onset zones. However, the majority of previous studies have only been applied to the localization of ictal onset zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings acquired from patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome (LGS), which is a type of intractable, pediatric, secondary generalized epilepsies with bilaterally synchronous ictal epileptiform discharges. To estimate the ictal onset zones from ictal iEEG recordings, we estimated time delays among iEEG signals based on the information theoretical approach. The results of the time delay analysis applied to the iEEG data of four successfully treated LGS patients corresponded well with the surgical resection areas identified by experienced epileptologists and multiple neuroimaging modalities, suggesting that the time delay analysis may provide useful information on the precise locations of ictal onset zones prior to epilepsy surgery in LGS patients.

22120563	Surgical and endovascular treatment of pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations	Pediatric spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and complex lesions to treat. There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described. The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal AVMs in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities. We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal AVMs between 1998 and 2010. Their charts were reviewed. Spinal AVMs most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord. Four patients had associated Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome and one had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 3) and paraparesis (n = 5). Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients. Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results. There were two treatment-related complications: one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and one case of scrotal swelling. The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months). The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4). One patient (11%) had a recurrence. Pediatric spinal AVMs require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes.
22128252	Clobazam as an adjunctive therapy in treating seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by the occurrence of multiple types of seizures and cognitive decline. Most children suffer from frequent seizures that are refractory to current medical management. Recent clinical trials have suggested that addition of clobazam may improve the clinical outcome for some LGS patients. Although clobazam has been available for over five decades, it has only recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. As a 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam is structurally related to the widely used 1,4-benzodiazepines, which include diazepam. Clobazam has been shown to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission by positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors, and to increase expression of transporters for both GABA and glutamate. The active metabolite n-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) also modulates GABA(A) receptors, and the relative importance of these two compounds in the clinical effectiveness of clobazam remains an open question. Clinical trials involving clobazam as an addon therapy in a variety of pediatric epilepsy populations have found a significant improvement in seizure control. In patients with LGS, clobazam may have greatest efficacy for drop seizures. Longstanding clinical experience suggests that clobazam is a safe and well tolerated antiepileptic drug with infrequent and mild adverse effects. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with clobazam may be a reasonable option for LGS patients, particularly those who are treatment-resistant.

22174830	Neutrophil elastase enhances sputum solubilization in cystic fibrosis patients receiving DNase therapy	Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from chronic lung infection and inflammation due to the secretion of viscous sputum. Sputum viscosity is caused by extracellular DNA, some of which originates from the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). During NET formation neutrophil elastase (NE) partially processes histones to decondense chromatin. NE is abundant in CF sputum and is thought to contribute to tissue damage. Exogenous nucleases are a palliative treatment in CF as they promote sputum solubilization. We show that in a process reminiscent of NET formation, NE enhances sputum solubilization by cleaving histones to enhance the access of exogenous nucleases to DNA. In addition, we find that in Cf sputum NE is predominantly bound to DNA, which is known to downregulate its proteolytic activity and may restrict host tissue damage. The beneficial role of NE in CF sputum solubilization may have important implications for the development of CF therapies targeting NE.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22196589	Utility of contrast echocardiography for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation screening in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	To evaluate the utility of transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) as a screening tool for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a single-center study of children who underwent baseline screening for PAVMs using both TTCE and chest computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of HHT. The CT and TTCE results were prospectively reviewed independently by 2 radiologists and 2 cardiologists blinded to the study results. Both intraobserver and interobserver agreement for interpreting TTCE results were excellent (κ = 0.97 and 0.92, respectively) and higher than the interobserver agreement for CT interpretation (κ = 0.75). The sensitivity and specificity of TTCE to predict PAVMs were 1 and 0.82, respectively, and the positive predictive and negative predictive values were 0.39 and 1, respectively. TTCE is a sensitive test for PAVMs in children with suspected HHT and can be a useful initial screening tool in pediatric HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

22227516	Iron deficiency anemia related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: response to treatment with bevacizumab	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant condition associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias of the pulmonary, gastrointestinal or hepatic circulations. The authors present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of HHT who presented for evaluation of anemia. She had an extensive history of iron sucrose infusions, frequent blood transfusions and hospitalizations for anemia related to gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. The patient was treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg infusion every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. In the next 4 months, her hemoglobin improved to 13.7 g/dL and she did not require iron or packed red blood cell transfusions for the next 8 months. Abnormal angiogenesis primarily due to mutations in the transforming growth factor β receptor endoglin and the activin receptor-like kinases is a central contributor to the formation of AVMs in HHT. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore may be a useful treatment against AVM formation in patients with HHT. The authors do caution that therapy has to be individualized as there are no randomized trials regarding its usage in patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

22256443	The impact of MRSA infection in the airways of children with cystic fibrosis; a case-control study	The prevalence of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) has risen dramatically over the past 10 years. The clinical significance of MRSA in CF patients remains undetermined. We conducted a review of patients with CF infected with MRSA over a 10 year period at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin between 1999 and 2009. We collected data from 24 patients infected with MRSA and 24 control patients without MRSA There was a significant difference between the two groups in the rate of decline in percentage FEV1 two years after MRSA infection (Difference: -17.4, 95% CI: -30.48, -4.31, p = 0.01). A similar trend was seen for FVC% and FEF25-75% predicted. This study suggests that persistent MRSA infection in the airways of children with CF is associated with diminished lung function two years post acquisition, when compared to a matched control cohort without MRSA.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

22266062	First long-term experience with the orphan drug rufinamide in children with myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome)	We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of the orphan drug rufinamide (RUF) in children with pharmacoresistant myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE, Doose syndrome). This was a retrospective European multicenter study on eight patients who had started an intention-to-treat trial of RUF between July 2007 and June 2010. Clinical information was collected via questionnaire. Responder rate was defined as reduction of seizure frequency ≥50% in comparison to four weeks before starting RUF. Maximum follow-up was eighteen months. Responder rates were 7/8 patients after 3 months, 6/8 patients after 6 months and 5/8 patients after 12 months. RUF seemed particularly effective in the prevention of myoclonic-astatic seizures (comparable with drop attacks in Lennox-Gastaut-Syndrome, for which RUF is particularly effective). Some loss of efficacy was noticed in the long-term observation. Side-effects occurred in two patients. Seizure aggravation was not observed. RUF seems to be a promising therapeutic option in children with MAE. Further studies are warranted to confirm these first observations.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

At analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 10 years. Of 48 patients, 15 (31.3%) had PRED in their post-section ECoG. Of these patients, 11 (73%) achieved significant (at least 50%) overall seizure reduction postoperatively. The phenomenon of PRED in callosotomy did not predict a better postoperative seizure outcome (p>0.05). We concluded that post-sectional ECoG recruitment of electrical discharges during callosotomy did not predict postoperative prognosis. However, this finding should be supported and elucidated by further studies. The heterogenous ECoG findings during callosotomy in our series might suggest a complicated role of the corpus callosum in the epileptogenesis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

22298109	MudPIT analysis of released proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa laboratory and clinical strains in relation to pro-inflammatory effects	Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most common virulent pathogen contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF). During bacterial lung colonization, the products of its metabolism are released in the extracellular space contributing to the pathogenic events associated with its presence. To gain insights on the mechanisms involved in the Pa pathogenesis we focused our attention on proteins released by Pa using a MudPIT approach combined with cell biology assays. Conditioned medium (CM) collected under aerobic and microaerobic conditions from Pa clinical strains (in early and late colonization),** unlike the laboratory strain, induced expression of IL-8 mRNA in CF airway epithelial cells**. We have identified proteins released by clinically relevant Pa strains, focusing on the pro-inflammatory effects as metalloproteases (MMPs). In fact, their expression pattern was associated with the highest pro-inflammatory activity measured in the early clinically isolated strain. The relation was further supported by the result of the analysis of a larger and independent set of Pa isolates derived from sporadically and chronically infected CF patients: 76% of sporadic samples expressed protease activity (n = 44), while only 27% scored positive in the chronically infected individuals (n = 38, p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). Finally, looking for a possible mechanism of action of bacterial MMPs, we found that CM from early clinical isolates can cleave CXCR1 on the surface of human neutrophils, suggesting a potential role for the bacterially released MMPs in the protection of the pathogen from the host's response.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22315512	Amniotic mesenchymal stem cells: a new source for hepatocyte-like cells and induction of CFTR expression by coculture with cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, with lung and liver manifestations. Because of pitfalls of gene therapy, novel approaches for reconstitution of the airway epithelium and CFTR expression should be explored. In the present study, human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) were isolated from term placentas and characterized for expression of phenotypic and pluripotency markers, and for differentiation potential towards mesoderm (osteogenic and adipogenic) lineages. Moreover, hAMSCs were induced to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, as demonstrated by mixed function oxidase activity and expression of albumin, alpha1-antitrypsin, and CK19. We also investigated the CFTR expression in hAMSCs upon isolation and in coculture with CF airway epithelial cells. Freshly isolated hAMSCs displayed low levels of CFTR mRNA, which even decreased with culture passages. Following staining with the vital dye CM-DiI, hAMSCs were mixed with CFBE41o- respiratory epithelial cells and seeded onto permeable filters. Flow cytometry demonstrated that 33-50% of hAMSCs acquired a detectable CFTR expression on the apical membrane, a result confirmed by confocal microscopy. Our data show that amniotic MSCs have the potential to differentiate into epithelial cells of organs relevant in CF pathogenesis and may contribute to partial correction of the CF phenotype.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22333903	One thing leads to another: the cascade of obligations when researchers report genetic research results to study participants	Even as debate continues about the putative obligation to proactively report genetic research results to study participants, there is an increasing need to attend to the obligations that might cascade from any initial report. We conducted an international, quasi-experimental survey of researchers involved in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) genetics to explore perceived obligations to ensure updated information or relevant clinical care subsequent to any initial communication of research results, and factors influencing these attitudes. 5-point Likert scales of dis/agreement were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate statistics. Of the 343 respondents (44% response rate), large majorities agreed that in general and in a variety of hypothetical research contexts, research teams that report results should ensure that participants gain subsequent access to updated information (74-83%) and implicated clinical services (79-87%). At the same time, researchers perceived barriers restricting access to relevant clinical care, though this was significantly more pronounced (P<0.001) for ASD (64%) than CF (34%). In the multivariate model, endorsement of cascading obligations was positively associated with researcher characteristics (eg, clinical role/training) and attitudes (eg, perceived initial reporting obligation), and negatively associated with the initial report of less scientifically robust hypothetical results, but unaffected by perceived or hypothetical barriers to care. These results suggest that researchers strongly endorse information and care-based obligations that cascade from the initial report of research results to study participants. In addition, they raise challenging questions about how any cascading obligations are to be met, especially where access challenges are already prevalent.	cystic fibrosis			320	One thing leads to another: the cascade of obligations when researchers report genetic research results to study participants.

22385575	A novel ENG mutation causing impaired co-translational processing of endoglin associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in mainly the endoglin gene (ENG) or activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1) gene (ACVRL1). We investigated the molecular basis of HHT in a Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation in ENG (c.38T>A, p.Leu13Gln) located in the signal peptide's hydrophobic core, but not in ACVRL1. In experiments in COS-1 cells, the Leu13Gln (L13Q) mutant endoglin appeared to be expressed as a precursor form, probably due to impaired protein processing. Flow cytometry analyses of the COS-1 cells transiently expressing recombinant endoglins revealed that the wild-type endoglin was detected on the cell surface, but the L13Q mutant was not. We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

We also analyzed expression patterns of the recombinant endoglins by immunofluorescent staining, and found that the wild-type co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but the L13Q mutant did not. These results implied that the L13Q mutant endoglin fails to insert into the ER, probably due to destruction of the hydrophobic core structure in the signal peptide to be recognized by signal recognition particles. Thus, the Leu13 in the signal peptide of endoglin might be essential for correct protein processing through the ER and cell-surface expression. Taken together, the novel c.38T>A mutation in ENG would impair co-translational processing of the endoglin, and could be responsible for HHT in this patient.
22396015	Pharmacological rescue of the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) detected by use of a novel fluorescence platform	Numerous human diseases arise because of defects in protein folding, leading to their degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Among them is cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR ), an epithelial anion channel. The most common mutation, F508del, disrupts CFTR folding, which blocks its trafficking to the plasma membrane. We developed a fluorescence detection platform using fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) to directly detect FAP-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface using a cell-impermeant probe. By using this approach, we determined the efficacy of new corrector compounds, both alone and in combination, to rescue F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane. Combinations of correctors produced additive or synergistic effects, improving the density of mutant CFTR at the cell surface up to ninefold over a single-compound treatment. The results correlated closely with assays of stimulated anion transport performed in polarized human bronchial epithelia that endogenously express F508del-CFTR. These findings indicate that the FAP-tagged constructs faithfully report mutant CFTR correction activity and that this approach should be useful as a screening assay in diseases that impair protein trafficking to the cell surface.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22421041	ALK1 signaling inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway	Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. **Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway.** Blocking Alk1 signaling during** postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).** Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

22421185	Rufinamide as an adjuvant treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	To evaluate the efficacy of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in children and adolescents with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). **The study was an open-label, observational clinical trial of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in intractable LGS patients**. This intent-to-treat trial included 4 weeks of scheduled titrated doses and a 12-week maintenance phase with a target dose of 20-40 mg/kg rufinamide, adjusted according to its effectiveness and tolerability after a baseline period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome was measured by the seizure-reduction rate according to individual seizure type over the 12-week maintenance period. One hundred and twenty-eight patients with LGS who were determined to be unresponsive to one or more antiepileptic drugs or dietary therapy were enrolled. Of the 128 patients enrolled, 112 (87.5%) completed the study. After add-on rufinamide treatment, 46 patients (35.9%) achieved a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 10 (7.8%) patients became seizure-free. When we identified those who responded with an at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency, 39.4% of the responders reported reductions in convulsive seizures, 36.4% in drop attacks, 33.3% in myoclonic seizures, and 20.0% in epileptic spasms. Overall, 32.8% of patients reported adverse effects, which were mostly mild and transient in nature. The most common adverse effects were fatigue (15 patients, 11.7%) and poor appetite (9 patients, 7.0%). Twenty-one (16.4%) patients experienced an increased seizure frequency. Rufinamide appears to be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for many cases of intractable LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

22433258	Validity of the oxygen uptake efficiency slope in children with cystic fibrosis and mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction	The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) has been proposed as an 'effort-independent' measure of cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, which could be used as an alternative measurement for peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)) in populations unable or unwilling to perform maximal exercise. The aim of the current study was to investigate the validity of the OUES in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Exercise data of 22 children with CF and mild to moderate airflow obstruction were analyzed and compared with exercise data of 22 healthy children. The OUES was calculated using data up to three different relative exercise intensities, namely 50%, 75%, and 100% of the total exercise duration, and normalized for body surface area (BSA). Only the OUES/BSA using the first 50% of the total exercise duration was significantly different between the groups. OUES/BSA values determined at different exercise intensities differed significantly within patients with CF and correlated only moderately with VO(2peak) and the ventilatory threshold. The OUES is not a valid submaximal measure of cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in children with mild to moderate CF, due to its limited distinguishing properties, its nonlinearity throughout progressive exercise, and its moderate correlation with VO(2peak) and the ventilatory threshold.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

22443637	Efficacy of the ketogenic diet in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a retrospective review of one institution's experience and summary of the literature	To determine the efficacy of the ketogenic diet for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) at our institution and in the literature. The records of children with LGS initiated on the ketogenic diet at our institution from 1994 to 2010 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included the presence of ≤2.5Hz spike-and-wave complexes on electroencephalogram, multiple seizure types including tonic, atonic, or atypical absence, developmental delay, and age under 1 year. We additionally reviewed the literature for cases of LGS treated with the ketogenic diet and their outcomes. Seventy-one children (41 males, 30 females, median age 3y 6mo, range 18mo-18y), with LGS were initiated on the ketogenic diet. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, after 6 months, 36 (51%) achieved more than 50% seizure reduction, 16 (23%) experienced more than 90% seizure reduction, and 1 (1%) achieved seizure freedom. Results were similar after 12 months. Age, sex, side effects, valproate use, and history of infantile spasms were not predictive of more than 90% seizure reduction. In the literature, 88 of 189 (47%) children with LGS had more than 50% seizure reduction after 3 to 36 months of ketogenic diet treatment. The ketogenic diet is efficacious in the treatment of LGS, with approximately one-half of children responding at 12 months.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

In this study, we describe three patients who each had an electroclinical overlap of two different epileptic encephalopathies (EE), with onset in a certain age period. Patient 1 had electroclinical features compatible with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWSS) syndrome that changed into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (symptomatic, cause porencephalic cyst) at the age of 8.5 years. Patient 2 had LGS which evolved into CSWSS at the age of 6 years (symptomatic, cause polymicrogyria). The third patient had cryptogenic CSWSS syndrome at age the age of 7 years which evolved into LGS at the age of 7.5 years. All three patients could be considered to have two EE: CSWSS syndrome and LGS or to have had overlapping features of these epileptic syndromes.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

22554673	Tacrolimus and cyclosporine have differential effects on the risk of development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome: results of a prospective, randomized international trial in lung transplantation	Chronic lung allograft dysfunction, which manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is recognized as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. In this study we assessed the efficacy and safety of two de novo immunosuppression protocols to prevent BOS. Our study approach was a multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1) open-label superiority investigation of de novo tacrolimus vs cyclosporine, with both study arms given mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone after lung transplantation. Cytolytic induction therapy was not employed. Patients were stratified at entry for cystic fibrosis. Primary outcome was incidence of BOS 3 years after transplant (intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary outcomes were survival and incidence of acute rejection, infection and other adverse events. Group demographic data were well matched: 110 of 124 tacrolimus vs 74 of 125 cyclosporine patients were treated per protocol (p < 0.01 by chi-square test). Cumulative incidence of BOS Grade ≥1 at 3 years was 11.6% (tacrolimus) vs 21.3% (cyclosporine) (cumulative incidence curves, p = 0.037 by Gray's test, pooled over strata). Univariate proportional sub-distribution hazards regression confirmed cyclosporine as a risk for BOS (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.77, p = 0.039). Three-year cumulative incidence of acute rejection was 67.4% (tacrolimus) vs 74.9% (cyclosporine) (p = 0.118 by Gray's test). One- and 3-year survival rates were 84.6% and 78.7% (tacrolimus) vs 88.6% and 82.8% (cyclosporine) (p = 0.382 by log-rank test). Cumulative infection rates were similar (p = 0.91), but there was a trend toward new-onset renal failure with tacrolimus (p = 0.09). Compared with cyclosporine, de novo tacrolimus use was found to be associated with a significantly reduced risk for BOS Grade ≥1 at 3 years despite a similar rate of acute rejection. However, no survival advantage was detected.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

22582115	Activity and inhibition of prostasin and matriptase on apical and basolateral surfaces of human airway epithelial cells	Prostasin is a membrane-anchored protease expressed in airway epithelium, where it stimulates salt and water uptake by cleaving the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). Prostasin is activated by another transmembrane tryptic protease, matriptase. Because ENaC-mediated dehydration contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF), prostasin and matriptase are potential therapeutic targets, but their catalytic competence on airway epithelial surfaces has been unclear. Seeking tools for exploring sites and modulation of activity, we used recombinant prostasin and matriptase to identify substrate t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-Gln-Ala-Arg-4-nitroanilide (QAR-4NA), which allowed direct assay of proteases in living cells. Comparisons of bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) with and without functioning cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) revealed similar levels of apical and basolateral aprotinin-inhibitable activity. Although recombinant matriptase was more active than prostasin in hydrolyzing QAR-4NA, cell surface activity resisted matriptase-selective inhibition, suggesting that prostasin dominates. Surface biotinylation revealed similar expression of matriptase and prostasin in epithelial cells expressing wild-type vs. ΔF508-mutated CFTR. However, the ratio of mature to inactive proprostasin suggested surface enrichment of active enzyme. Although small amounts of matriptase and prostasin were shed spontaneously, prostasin anchored to the cell surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol was the major contributor to observed QAR-4NA-hydrolyzing activity. For example, the apical surface of wild-type CFBE41o- epithelial cells express 22% of total, extractable, aprotinin-inhibitable, QAR-4NA-hydrolyzing activity and 16% of prostasin immunoreactivity. In conclusion, prostasin is present, mature and active on the apical surface of wild-type and CF bronchial epithelial cells, where it can be targeted for inhibition via the airway lumen.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22622516	BMP9 induces EphrinB2 expression in endothelial cells through an Alk1-BMPRII/ActRII-ID1/ID3-dependent pathway: implications for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type II	ALK1 (ACVRL1) is a member of the TGFβ receptor family and is expressed predominantly by arterial endothelial cells (EC). Mutations in ACVRL1 are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2), a disease manifesting as fragile vessels, capillary overgrowth, and numerous arterio-venous malformations. Arterial EC also express EphrinB2, which has multiple roles in vascular development and angiogenesis and is known to be reduced in ACVRL1 knockout mice. Using an in vitro angiogenesis model we find that the Alk1 ligand BMP9 induces EphrinB2 in EC, and this is entirely dependent on expression of Alk1 and at least one of the co-receptors BMPRII or ActRII. BMP9 induces both ID1 and ID3, and both are necessary for full induction of EphrinB2. Loss of Alk1 or EphrinB2 results in increased arterial-venous anastomosis, while loss of Alk1 but not EphrinB2 results in increased VEGFR2 expression and enhanced capillary sprouting. Conversely, BMP9 blocks EC sprouting and this is dependent on Alk1, BMPRII/ActRII and ID1/ID3. Finally, notch signaling overcomes the loss of Alk1-restoring EphrinB2 expression in EC, and curbing excess sprouting. Thus, in an in vitro model of HHT2, loss of Alk1 blocks BMP9 signaling, resulting in reduced EphrinB2 expression, enhanced VEGFR2 expression, and misregulated EC sprouting and anastomosis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

22629163	Surgical treatment of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome phenotype	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating and refractory generalized epilepsy affecting children and adolescents. In this study we report the results of resective surgery in 18 patients with LGS phenotype who underwent single-lobe/lesionectomy or multilobe resection plus multiple subpial transection and/or callosotomy. After surgery, seven patients became completely seizure-free (Engel Class I) and five almost seizure-free (Engel Class II). Additional four had significant seizure control (Engel Class III), and two had no change in seizure frequency (Engel Class IV). Of the 4 patients without any lesion on brain MRI, 2 ended with Engel Class II, 1 with III and the other with IV in Engels' classification. Mean intelligence quotient (IQ) increased from 56.1 ± 8.1 (mean ± SD) before operation to 67.4 ± 8.2 (mean ± SD) after operation, a significant improvement (P = 0.001). Results also indicated that the younger the patient at surgery, or the shorter the interval between onset of seizure and resective operation, the better the intellectual outcome. Our data suggest that resective epilepsy surgery can be successful in patients with LGS phenotype as long as the EEG shows dominance of discharges in one hemisphere and corresponding ipsilateral imaging findings, even with contralateral ictal discharges.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		243	Surgical treatment of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome phenotype. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating and refractory generalized epilepsy affecting children and adolescents. In this study we report the results of resective surgery in 18 patients with LGS phenotype who underwent single-lobe/lesionectomy or multilobe resection plus multiple subpial transection and/or callosotomy. After surgery, seven patients became completely seizure-free (Engel Class I) and five almost seizure-free (Engel Class II). Additional four had significant seizure control (Engel Class III), and two had no change in seizure frequency (Engel Class IV). Of the 4 patients without any lesion on brain MRI, 2 ended with Engel Class II, 1 with III and the other with IV in Engels' classification.

22633633	Immunoglobulin treatment for severe childhood epilepsy	We have used intravenous immunoglobulin to treat pediatric patients with various severe epileptic conditions. This retrospective, multicenter study comprised 64 consecutive patients treated with immunoglobulins for either epileptic encephalopathy or refractory epilepsy. The rate of full or partial improvement according to specific syndrome involved three of four patients with idiopathic West syndrome, six of 12 patients with electrical status epilepticus in sleep, eight of 19 patients with an undefined syndrome, one of three patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and one of two patients with Rasmussen encephalitis. Intravenous immunoglobulins were ineffective in 10 patients with symptomatic West syndrome, nine with febrile infection-related status epilepticus, three with myoclonic astatic epilepsy, and two with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Nine patients (14%) demonstrated complete resolution, and 10 (15.6%) exhibited partial improvement. Of these 19 responders (29.7%), eight relapsed. Although intravenous immunoglobulin is not suitable for all cases of epilepsy, it may prove efficacious for specific epileptic syndromes, mainly idiopathic West syndrome and electrical status epilepticus during sleep.

22653767	Lung function from infancy to preschool in a cohort of children with cystic fibrosis	This study aimed to describe lung function in a cohort of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who underwent infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) and preschool spirometry. Children performed up to four IPFTs (raised volume rapid thoracic compression technique) over 1 yr and five preschool spirometry tests over up to 2 yrs during participation in prospective, multicentre studies of infant and preschool lung function. All lung function data were reviewed centrally for measurement acceptability. 45 children had 252 acceptable measurements (137 IPFTs and 115 preschool spirometries) at ages 0.3-6.5 yrs. The median number of measurements per participant was 6 (range 3-9). Recent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was associated with 5.1% (95% CI 0.01-9.9%) lower forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)) and 16.4% (95% CI 7.0-24.9%) lower forced expiratory flow at 25-25% of forced vital capacity (FEF(25-75%)), after adjustment for length, test type and centre. Recent cough was associated with 5.7% (95% CI 1.1-10.1%) lower FEV(0.5) and 10.1% (95% CI 0.6-18.7%) lower FEF(25-75%). Even after accounting for infection status, cough, sex, length, test type and centre, there was significant inter-individual variability in lung function (p<0.01 for each of FEV(0.5), FEF(25-75%) and forced vital capacity). Recent P. aeruginosa infection and cough are associated with lower lung function in children with CF. Significant inter-individual variability in lung function remains to be explained.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

A cornerstone of CF management is reduction of the inflammatory burden in the lung. We present the case of a 19-year-old CF patient who demonstrated significant clinical improvement in her lung disease associated with a reduction in sputum percent neutrophils, following commencement of etanercept (TNF-α antagonist) for rheumatoid arthritis. She has not had any infectious complications or other significant adverse effects during 2 years of treatment. It may be time to reconsider TNF-α antagonists as potential anti-inflammatory agents for CF lung disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

22677424	Rufinamide efficacy and safety as adjunctive treatment in children with focal drug resistant epilepsy: the first Italian prospective study	Rufinamide is a new antiepileptic drug approved as add-on treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome from the age of 4 years, and for the treatment of focal seizures in adults and adolescents. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of add-on Rufinamide in the treatment of childhood focal drug resistant epilepsy. We recruited 70 patients for a prospective, add-on, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were: 3 years of age or more; focal drug resistant epilepsy despite the use of three previous AEDs; use of at least one other AED, but no more than three at baseline; more than one seizure per month in the previous 6 months. Rufinamide efficacy was observed up to 12 months of follow-up, with a total responder rate of 38.57%. We found the best results in focal epilepsies due to structural/metabolic etiology (42.6%). The responder rate was similar for focal seizures with secondary generalization, simple focal seizures other than myoclonic jerks, and complex partial seizures. Response to Rufinamide was not related to the age. Our experience suggests that Rufinamide can be effective in reducing focal seizure frequency in children with drug resistant epilepsy, and that it can be considered as a safe drug.

22679004	Altered de novo lipogenesis contributes to low adipose stores in cystic fibrosis mice	Cystic fibrosis (CF) mouse models exhibit exocrine pancreatic function, yet they do not develop adipose stores to the levels of non-CF mice. CF mice homozygous for the Cftr mutation (F508del) at 3 wk (postweaning) and 6 wk (young adult) of age had markedly less adipose tissue than non-CF mice. Food intake was markedly lower in 3-wk-old CF mice but normalized by 6 wk of age. Both 3- and 6-wk-old mice had dietary lipid absorption and fecal lipid excretion comparable to non-CF mice. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), determined by (2)H incorporation, was reduced in CF mice. At 3 wk, F508del mice had significantly decreased DNL of palmitate and stearate, by 83% and 80%, respectively. By 6 wk, DNL rates in non-CF mice remained unchanged compared with 3-wk-old mice, while DNL rates of F508del mice were still reduced, by 33% and 40%, respectively. Adipose tissue fatty acid (FA) profiles were comparable in CF and non-CF mice, indicating that adipose differences are quantitative, not qualitative. A correspondingly lower content of (2)H-labeled FA was found in CF adipose tissue, consistent with reduced deposition of newly made hepatic triglycerides and/or decreased adipose tissue lipogenesis. Hepatic transcriptome analysis revealed lower mRNA expression from several genes involved in FA biosynthesis, suggesting downregulation of this pathway as a mechanism for the reduced lipogenesis. These novel data provide a model for altered lipid metabolism in CF, independent of malabsorption, and may partly explain the inability of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to completely restore normal body mass to CF patients.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22681320	Complete remission of seizures after corpus callosotomy	Corpus callosotomy is usually intended to alleviate-not to achieve total control of-epileptic seizures. A few patients experience complete seizure control after callosotomy, but the associated clinical factors are unknown. The object of this study was to investigate clinical factors associated with long-term seizure remission after total corpus callosotomy in patients with infantile or early childhood onset epilepsy. Thirteen consecutive patients with infantile or early childhood onset epilepsy underwent 1-stage total corpus callosotomy for alleviation of seizures. Their age at surgery ranged from 1 year and 5 months to 24 years (median 7 years). Eleven patients had West syndrome at the onset of disease, and the other 2 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. All patients suffered from spasms, axial tonic seizures, or atonic seizures. Six patients had proven etiology of epilepsy, including tuberous sclerosis, polymicrogyria, trauma, and Smith-Magenis syndrome. The association between postoperative seizure freedom and preoperative factors including age at surgery, no MRI abnormalities, proven etiology, and focal electroencephalographic epileptiform discharges was examined. Postoperative seizure freedom was achieved in 4 of 13 patients for a minimum of 12 months. All 4 patients had no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology. None of the 8 patients with MRI abnormality, 6 patients with known etiology of epilepsy, or 4 patients aged older than 10 years at surgery achieved seizure freedom. Two of the 7 patients with focal electroencephalographic abnormalities became seizure free. Absence of MRI abnormalities was significantly associated with postoperative seizure freedom (p < 0.01). Complete seizure remission is achieved after total corpus callosotomy in a subgroup of patients with intractable epilepsy following West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. One-stage total corpus callosotomy at a young age may provide a higher rate of seizure freedom, especially for patients with no MRI abnormalities and no identified etiology of epilepsy.

Surgical and endoscopic treatments for haemorrhage due to gastrointestinal vascular malformations are compromised when lesions are diffuse, escape identification or are inaccessible to treatment. Hormonal treatment with oestrogen and progestagens is still controversial based on contradictory results from two randomised clinical trials. Although somatostatin and its long-acting analogue, octreotide, have been reported to be beneficial in preventing rebleeding, there is no consensus on this type of treatment. This case report shows how the combination of ethinyloestradiol and norethisterone markedly reduced the need for blood transfusions with few side effects in one patient; in comparison, octreotide seems less effective but this could be related to a worsening of the disease.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

22727329	Developing a measure of eating attitudes and behaviours in cystic fibrosis	Eating disorders or disturbed eating attitudes and behaviours (EABs) may contribute to poor nutritional status in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Existing measures of disturbed EABs can have different meanings in this population and do not assess CF-related EABs. A self-report measure of EABs in CF was developed to highlight areas of eating disturbance. The content validity of a draft measure was evaluated via expert evaluation and literature review and an amended measure piloted with 8 CF patients using cognitive interviewing. A further amended measure was administered to 155 CF patients (11-62 years) attending CF clinics. Principal components analyses revealed a three-factor structure ('Desire for thinness and weight loss', 'Disturbed EABs', and 'Appetite') with good internal consistencies for subscales and the 21-item whole measure. The measure looks promising as a tool to highlight EAB disturbance in CF. Further work will establish its construct validity and clarify interpretation of subscales.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

22729251	Monitoring the autonomic nervous activity as the objective evaluation of music therapy for severely and multiply disabled children	Severely and multiply disabled children (SMDC) are frequently affected in more than one area of development, resulting in multiple disabilities.  The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of music therapy in SMDC using monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous system, by the frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability.  We studied six patients with SMDC (3 patients with cerebral palsy, 1 patient with posttraumatic syndrome after head injury, 1 patient with herpes encephalitis sequelae, and 1 patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome characterized by frequent seizures, developmental delay and psychological and behavioral problems), aged 18-26 (mean 22.5 ± 3.5).  By frequency domain method using electrocardiography, we measured the high frequency (HF; with a frequency ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), which represents parasympathetic activity, the low frequency/high frequency ratio, which represents sympathetic activity between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, and heart rate.  A music therapist performed therapy to all patients through the piano playing for 50 min.  We monitored each study participant for 150 min before therapy, 50 min during therapy, and 10 min after therapy.  Interestingly, four of 6 patients showed significantly lower HF components during music therapy than before therapy, suggesting that these four patients might react to music therapy through the suppression of parasympathetic nervous activities.  Thus, music therapy can suppress parasympathetic nervous activities in some patients with SMDC.  The monitoring changes in the autonomic nervous activities could be a powerful tool for the objective evaluation of music therapy in patients with SMDC.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

Epilepsy in all of the patients was well controlled by medication. Series of ESWL treatment were safely performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. We recommend that maintenance of anesthesia be performed by sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, which can increase threshold of epileptic stroke, and controlled ventilation with a muscle relaxant should be performed to prevent lung or renal injury by the shock wave of ESWL.

22747891	Frequency of fungi in respiratory samples from Turkish cystic fibrosis patients	An increased isolation of fungi from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported. The prevalence of different fungi in CF patients from Turkey is not known. Our aim was to determine the frequency of fungi in the respiratory tract of Turkish CF patients. We investigated a total of 184 samples from 48 patients. Samples were inoculated on Medium B+ and CHROMagar Candida. Candida albicans was the predominant yeast isolated [30 patients (62.5%)], followed by C. parapsilosis [6 (12.5%)] and C. dubliniensis 5 (10.4%). Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common filamentous fungus [5 (10.4%)] and non-fumigatus Aspergillus species were isolated from four (8.3%) patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected bacterium in C. albicans positive samples (53.57%).

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY		268	Frequency of fungi in respiratory samples from Turkish cystic fibrosis patients. An increased isolation of fungi from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported. The prevalence of different fungi in CF patients from Turkey is not known. Our aim was to determine the frequency of fungi in the respiratory tract of Turkish CF patients. We investigated a total of 184 samples from 48 patients. Samples were inoculated on Medium B+ and CHROMagar Candida. Candida albicans was the predominant yeast isolated [30 patients (62.5%)], followed by C. parapsilosis [6 (12.5%)] and C. dubliniensis 5 (10.4%). Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common filamentous fungus [5 (10.4%)] and non-fumigatus Aspergillus species were isolated from four (8.3%) patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected bacterium in C. albicans positive samples (53.57%). A. fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. aureus were detected together in 75% of A. fumigatus positive samples each. No statistically significant relationship was detected between growth of yeast and moulds and age, gender, the use of inhaled corticosteroids or tobramycin.

22780580	Dramatic weight loss with rufinamide	"Rufinamide (RUF) is a novel antiepileptic drug considered as second-line therapy in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) have consisted mainly of drowsiness, irritability, vomiting, and loss of appetite. RUF is considered as a ""weight-neutral"" drug. We found clinically significant weight loss in 7 of 15 consecutive adult patients (47%; 3 male, 4 female, aged 18-31 years) treated with RUF as add-on therapy (800-2,400 mg/day: 23.5-57.1 mg/kg/day). The body mass index (BMI) decreased by 7.3-18.7%. Two patients were obese class I before RUF. Five patients (71%) were underweight before RUF (mild in one case, moderate in two cases, and severe in two cases). Four of these patients stopped RUF because of this adverse effect. RUF was recommenced in two patients using a lower and slower dosing strategy; one patient showed improvement in seizure control and no weight loss but RUF was re-stopped in the second patient because of continued weight loss. Despite of weight loss, RUF was continued in two other patients because it reduced seizure activity. We primarily related weight loss to reduced food intake, that is, loss of appetite and nausea, although in two patients no obvious loss of appetite was reported. RUF can cause clinically significant weight loss in adult patients, even at low dose. This AE can affect patients who are already underweight. There is a possibility that lower starting doses and slower escalation might minimize weight loss, but further information is required to determine whether this is the case."

22781769	Clinical features and screening of ACVRL1 gene in II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	To analyze the clinical features and pathogenic gene of the patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The clinical features of 3 HHT families were collected. And the patients were diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic analyzed criteria of HHT, the ACVRL1 gene screened and the conservation of mutation protein. Three probands and 1 patient were diagnostic for HHT and 2 patients were suspected. In family I, there was a missense mutation of ACVRL1 gene in c.287A > G on 2 patients, leading to the transferal of amino acids from Asn to Ser at 96(th) place. In family II, there was a missense mutation of c.1271C > T on ACVRL1 in 2 patients, leading to the transfer of amino acids from Pro to Leu at 424(th) place. In family III, there was a deletion mutation of c.147delC on ACVRL1 so as to produce only the former 53 amino acids of ALK1 protein. Through an analysis of multi-species conservation, the mutations were conserved between multiple species. By querying the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, we confirmed that the mutation was not of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genetic screening of HHT patients may identify their virulence gene. And genetic screening of their offspring is helpful for the early diagnosis and prevention before disease onset.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

22849993	Migraine with aura and recurrent vertigo attacks in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by systemic vascular diseases mainly shown as arterio-visnous fistula (AVF). Here, we presented a 29-year-old woman with HHT complicated with migraine with aura (MWA) and vertigo. At the age of twelve years, she developed migraine with visual aura. At that time, migraine attacks were seen three times a year. At the age of 29 years, she also developed speech disturbance as migraine aura. At the ages of 20 and 29 years, she repeatedly suffered from positional vertigo attacks for a month. **Physical examination revealed dilation of the capillary vessels at tongue, soft palate, and nasal mucosa and AVFs were located in the upper cervical cord, parietal lobe, and bilateral lungs. These clinical findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of HHT**. **Embolization of pulmonary AVF decreased the frequency of migraine attacks during 2-year follow-up after the embolization.** The frequency of migraine in patients with HHT is higher than that of general population as well as the prevalence of vertigo. Therefore, MWA and vertigo presented in the patient with HHT suggests that there is a common pathological mechanism of dysfunction of endothelial cells and R-L shunt, among HHT, MWA, and vertigo.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

22856641	New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance in cystic fibrosis	Topical delivery of aerosolized therapies is an established treatment for chronic airway infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent developments in nebuliser technology have enabled Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) of mesh generated aerosol particles resulting in more efficient airway deposition than existing jet nebulizers. An additional feature of these new devices is the ability to record and examine the performance of the device by downloading stored data (electronic data capture).** In a series of studies we have used this downloading facility to monitor treatment times and examine adherence to nebulizer therapy in our pediatric patients.** We found routine adherence monitoring is possible in busy CF clinic. We have shown that good adherence to treatment can be maintained in both patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on long-term therapy, and in patients with first/new growths of Pseudomonas on short-term eradication therapy. When adherence was examined from an individual perspective, we demonstrated a wide variation both between and within individual patients. A further modification of AAD technology, Target Inhalation Mode (TIM) optimises patient inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism. This new breathing mode has also been evaluated in our pediatric CF clinic in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and we have shown that children maintain adherence to treatment through the TIM mouthpiece and average treatment times reduced from 6.9 to 3.7 min when using TIM. This is a new era of aerosol delivery and novel advances in medical devices need to be monitored and assessed rigorously, particularly as new and potentially expensive therapies emerge from translational studies. Electronic data capture enables CF teams to work in an open partnership with patients to achieve the common goals of improving drug delivery and reducing patient burden.	cystic fibrosis			326	New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance in cystic fibrosis.

22859374	Docking protein Gab2 regulates mucin expression and goblet cell hyperplasia through TYK2/STAT6 pathway	Goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) and mucous hypersecretion are common pathological features of chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis. Despite numerous studies, the molecular basis for this condition remains elusive. Gab2 is a member of the Dos/Gab subfamily scaffolding molecules and plays important roles in regulating growth, differentiation, and inflammation. We found that an elevated level of Gab2 correlates with up-regulated mucus in airway epithelia from patients with lung cancer or COPD, suggesting the potential involvement of Gab2 in pathological lesions in lungs. Knockdown of Gab2 in human airway epithelial cells in vitro decreases IL-13-induced expression of mucin genes. To address the in vivo role of Gab2 in lungs, Gab2-knockout (Gab2(-/-)) mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Further analysis of lungs in an OVA-induced allergy model suggested that GCH and mucus production are remarkably reduced in Gab2(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, Gab2 positively regulates IL-13-induced activation of TYK2/STAT6 by decreasing SOCS3-mediated degradation of TYK2. Together, we define a novel role for Gab2 in mediating mucin gene expression and GCH; these findings have important implications for the pathogenesis and therapy of airway inflammatory diseases.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22898134	Neutrophil necrosis and annexin 1 degradation associated with airway inflammation in lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis	Neutrophils sequestered in lower respiratory tract secretions in the inflamed lung may undergo apoptosis and/or necrosis and release toxic cellular contents that can injure airways or parenchyma. This study examined the viability of neutrophils retrieved from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis. Integrity and stability of intracellular proteins in neutrophils from proximal airways and peripheral blood from lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis were analyzed via Western blot analysis and determination of neutrophil viability by morphologic appearance and flow cytometry. Neutrophils in tracheobronchial secretions from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis who had normal chest radiographic imaging but bronchoscopic evidence of purulent tracheobronchitis post-transplant were necrotic and associated with degradation of intracellular protein annexin 1. The neutrophil influx was compartmentalized to large airways and not detected in peripheral bronchoalveolar airspaces sampled via bronchoalveolar lavage. Peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects cultured in vitro demonstrated that annexin 1 degradation, particularly to a 33 kDa annexin 1 breakdown product (A1-BP), was associated with neutrophil necrosis, but not apoptosis. Although annexin 1 degradation was not specific to neutrophil necrosis, it was a sensitive marker of intracellular protein degradation associated with neutrophil necrosis. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 kDa A1-BP was not observed in peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects, but annexin 1 appeared to be degraded in peripheral blood neutrophils of lung transplant recipients despite a normal morphologic appearance of these cells. Neutrophils were necrotic from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial tracheobronchitis, and this process may begin when neutrophils are still in the systemic circulation prior to sequestration in inflamed airways. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 kDa A1-BP may be useful as a sensitive marker to detect neutrophil necrosis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

In th**is study, we tried to determine the clinical and EEG characteristics of patients with LGS in south Iran**. In this retrospective study, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of LGS were recruited at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from 2008 through 2012. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), epilepsy risk factors, EEG and imaging findings of all patients were registered routinely. During the study period, 2500 patients with epilepsy were registered at our epilepsy clinic. One-hundred and thirty-five patients (5.4%) were diagnosed as having LGS. Age of onset (mean±standard deviation) was 3.2±3.8 years. In 14 (10.4%) patients, age of onset was above 8 years. Eighty-three patients (61.5%) were male and 52 (38.5%) were female. The most common seizure type was tonic, followed by generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. The most common EEG finding was slow spike-wave complexes. The most common abnormal MRI finding was brain atrophy. LGS is an uncommon epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple seizure types, a specific electroencephalographic pattern and psychomotor retardation, beginning in childhood. However, variants of this classical triad including atypical EEG findings, normal psychomotor function, and late-onset disease could be seen in some patients. These atypical findings in a patient with typical history for LGS should not deter from the correct diagnosis. The mainstay for making a correct syndromic diagnosis is a detailed clinical history.

22928917	Co action of CFTR and AQP1 increases permeability of peritoneal epithelial cells on estrogen-induced ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome	Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication associated with fertility drugs. It is characterized by increased vascular permeability and substantial fluid shift with accumulation in the body cavity. The pathogenesis of OHSS remains obscure, and no definitive treatments are currently available. Using western blot and short-circuit current (Isc) techniques, we investigate the potential coactions of analysis in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and aquaporin 1 (AQP1) on the hyper permeability of body cavity peritoneal epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of OHSS. The rats develop OHSS symptoms, with the up regulation of both CFTR and AQP1 expression and enhanced CFTR channel activity in peritoneal epithelial cells, can also be mimicked by administration of estrogen, alone in ovariectomized rats. Administration of progesterone suppresses CFTR activity, OHSS symptoms as well as CFTR and AQP1 expression. Besides, AQP1 inhibitor, HgCl(2), can suppress CFTR channel activity. Therefore, antisera against CFTR or AQP1 to OHSS animals may result in alleviation of the symptom. This study confirms the coactions of CFTR and AQP1 play a critical role in the development and progression of increased peritoneal epithelial permeability in severe OHSS. These findings may provide grounds for ameliorating assisted reproduction treatment strategy to reduce the risk of OHSS in in vitro fertilization (IVF).	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

22930931	Croatian guidelines for the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency	Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a major consequence of pancreatic diseases (e. g. chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis), extrapancreatic diseases like celiac disease and Crohn's disease, and gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgical resections. Recognition of this entity is highly relevant to avoid malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. The main clinical consequence of PEI is fat maldigestion and malabsorption, resulting in steatorrhoea. Pancreatic exocrine function should be assessed by measuring levels of faecal elastase-1. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PEI. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients. In adults, the initial recommended dose of pancreatic enzymes is 25.000 units of lipase per meal, titrating up to a maximum of 80000 units of lipase per meal. Large meals require 25.000 - 80.000 units of lipase per meal while snacks require 10.000 - 40.000 units of lipase per meal. Oral pancreatic enzymes should be taken with meals to ensure adequate mixing with the chyme. Adjunct therapy with acid-suppressing agents may be useful in patients who continue to experience symptoms of PEI despite high-dose enzyme therapy. Patients with PEI should be encouraged to consume small, frequent meals and to abstain from alcohol. Dietary fat restriction is not recommended for patients with PEI.	cystic fibrosis			246	Croatian guidelines for the management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

22936895	Pancrelipase: an evidence-based review of its use for treating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency	Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is often observed in patients with pancreatic diseases, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and tumors, or after surgical resection. PEI often results in malnutrition, weight loss and steatorrhea, which together increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, nutritional interventions, such as low-fat diets and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), are needed to improve the clinical symptoms, and to address the pathophysiology of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. PERT with delayed-release pancrelipase is now becoming a standard therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency because it significantly improves the coefficients of fat and nitrogen absorption as well as clinical symptoms, without serious treatment-emergent adverse events. The major adverse events were tolerable gastrointestinal tract symptoms, such as stomach pain, nausea, and bloating. Fibrosing colonopathy, a serious complication, is associated with high doses of enzymes. Several pancrelipase products have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in recent years. Although many double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of pancrelipase products have been conducted in recent years, these studies have enrolled relatively few patients and have often been less than a few weeks in duration. Moreover, few studies have addressed the issue of pancreatic diabetes, a type of diabetes that is characterized by frequent hypoglycemia, which is difficult to manage. In addition, it is unclear whether PERT improves morbidity and mortality in such settings. Therefore, large, long-term prospective studies are needed to identify the optimal treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The studies should also examine the extent to which PERT using pancrelipase improves mortality and morbidity. The etiology and severity of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency often differ among patients with gastrointestinal diseases or diabetes (type 1 and type 2), and among elderly subjects. Finally, although there is currently limited clinical evidence, numerous extrapancreatic diseases and conditions that are highly prevalent in the general population may also be considered potential targets for PERT and related treatments.	cystic fibrosis			371	Pancrelipase: an evidence-based review of its use for treating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.

22966014	Nonintegral stoichiometry in CFTR gating revealed by a pore-lining mutation	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Unlike most other ABC proteins that function as active transporters, CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel. The opening of CFTR's gate is associated with ATP-induced dimerization of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), whereas gate closure is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis-triggered partial separation of the NBDs. This generally held theme of CFTR gating-a strict coupling between the ATP hydrolysis cycle and the gating cycle-is put to the test by our recent finding of a short-lived, post-hydrolytic state that can bind ATP and reenter the ATP-induced original open state. We accidentally found a mutant CFTR channel that exhibits two distinct open conductance states, the smaller O1 state and the larger O2 state. In the presence of ATP, the transition between the two states follows a preferred O1→O2 order, a telltale sign of a violation of microscopic reversibility, hence demanding an external energy input likely from ATP hydrolysis, as such preferred gating transition was abolished in a hydrolysis-deficient mutant. Interestingly, we also observed a considerable amount of opening events that contain more than one O1→O2 transition, indicating that more than one ATP molecule may be hydrolyzed within an opening burst. We thus conclude a nonintegral stoichiometry between the gating cycle and ATP consumption. Our results lead to a six-state gating model conforming to the classical allosteric mechanism: both NBDs and transmembrane domains hold a certain degree of autonomy, whereas the conformational change in one domain will facilitate the conformational change in the other domain.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23018639	BMP9 regulates endoglin-dependent chemokine responses in endothelial cells.	BMP9 signaling has been implicated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and vascular remodeling, acting via the HHT target genes, endoglin and ALK1. This study sought to identify endothelial BMP9-regulated proteins that could affect the HHT phenotype. Gene ontology analysis of cDNA microarray data obtained after BMP9 treatment of primary human endothelial cells indicated regulation of chemokine, adhesion, and inflammation pathways. These responses included the up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 and down-regulation of its receptor CXCR4. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified additional secreted proteins, including the chemokine CXCL10/IP10**. RNA knockdown of endoglin and ALK1 impaired SDF1/CXCR4 regulation by BMP9**. Because of the association of SDF1 with ischemia, we analyzed its expression under hypoxia in response to BMP9 in vitro, and during the response to hindlimb ischemia, in endoglin-deficient mice. BMP9 and hypoxia were additive inducers of SDF1 expression. Moreover, the data suggest that endoglin deficiency impaired SDF1 expression in endothelial cells in vivo. Our data implicat**e BMP9 in regulation of the SDF1/CXCR4 chemokine axis in endothelial cells and point to a role for BMP9 signaling via endoglin in a switch from an SDF1-responsive autocrine phenotype to an SDF1 nonresponsive paracrine state that represses endothelial cell migration and may promote vessel maturation**.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23041289	Magnetoencephalographic analysis of paroxysmal fast activity in patients with epileptic spasms	**This study sought to demonstrate the origin and propagation of paroxysmal fast activity (PFA) in patients with epileptic spasms (ESs), using time-frequency analyses of magnetoencephalogram (MEG) PFA recordings.** A 204-channel helmet-shaped MEG, with a 600Hz sampling rate, was used to examine PFA in 3 children with ESs. We analyzed MEG recordings of PFA by short-time Fourier transform and the aberrant area or high-power spectrum was superimposed onto reconstructed three-dimensional magnetic resonance images as moving images. One ictal discharge was collected. One child and one adult with PFA due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were also examined for comparison. All four PFAs in Patient 1 and five PFAs in Patient 3 were generated from one hemisphere. In Patient 2, four of seven PFAs were generated from one hemisphere and the remaining three were generated from both hemispheres. In Patient 3, one ictal MEG showed ictal discharges that were generated from the same area as the PFA, although the electroencephalogram showed no discharge. In Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, all 10 PFAs were generated from bilateral hemispheres simultaneously. Short-time Fourier transform analyses of MEG PFA can show the origin and form of propagation of PFA. These results suggest that ESs are representative of focal seizures and the mechanism of PFA is different between ESs and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

23060444	Regulation of activation and processing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by a complex electrostatic interaction between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.	NEG2 regulates CFTR gating but the mechanism is unknown. A putative NEG2-CL3 electrostatic attraction, possibly weakened by Arg-764/Arg-766 of the R domain, prohibited CFTR activation. A charge exchange between NEG2 and CL3 caused misprocessing. Electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing may be asymmetric at the CL3-R interface. The CL3-R interface is optimally designed for multiple regulations of CFTR functions. NEG2, a short C-terminal segment (817-838) of the unique regulatory (R) domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, has been reported to regulate CFTR gating in response to cAMP-dependent R domain phosphorylation. The underlying mechanism, however, is unclear. Here, Lys-946 of cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3) is proposed as counter-ion of Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 of NEG2 to prevent the channel activation by PKA. Arg-764 or Arg-766 of the Ser-768 phosphorylation site of the R domain is proposed to promote the channel activation possibly by weakening the putative CL3-NEG2 electrostatic attraction. First, not only D835A, D836A, and E838A but also K946A reduced the PKA-dependent CFTR activation. Second, both K946D and D835R/D836R/E838R mutants were activated by ATP and curcumin to a different extent. Third, R764A and R766A mutants enhanced the PKA-dependent activation. However, it is very exciting that D835R/D836R/E838R and K946D/H950D and H950R exhibited normal channel processing and activity whereas D835R/D836R/E838R/K946D/H950D was fractionally misprocessed and silent in response to forskolin. Further, D836R and E838R played a critical role in the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR processing, and Ser-768 phosphorylation may not be involved. Thus, a complex interfacial interaction among CL3, NEG2, and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may be responsible for the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23083943	Effectiveness and tolerability of rufinamide in children and young adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a single center study in Korea	Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED), which is known to be effective in the treatment of partial seizures and drop attacks in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in those with LGS. Patients with LGS who had received rufinamide adjunctive therapy were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively reviewed these patient's baseline clinical characteristics, and the reduction of seizure frequency and adverse events after the use of rufinamide. Twenty-three patients (15 males and 8 females, ages 4-22 years) were enrolled in the study. All the patients suffered from daily head drops and tonic seizures despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. After one month of rufinamide, one patient (4.3%) achieved freedom from seizures, ten (43.5%) achieved a ≥50% decrease in seizure frequency. After six months of rufinamide, eight patients (34.8%) maintained a satisfactory response (seizure free in one, and greater than 50% seizure reduction in seven). Adverse events were reported in six (26.0%) patients, which were somnolence in three, aggressive behavior in two, and aggravation of seizure in one patient. Our results suggest that rufinamide is effective and safe in children and young adults with LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

23090599	Persister cells: molecular mechanisms related to antibiotic tolerance	It is a given that new antibiotics are needed to combat drug-resistant pathogens. However, this is only a part of the need-we actually never had antibiotics capable of eradicating an infection. All pathogens produce a small subpopulation of dormant persister cells that are highly tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Once an antibiotic concentration drops, surviving persisters re-establish the population, causing a relapsing chronic infection. Persisters are especially significant when the pathogen is shielded from the immune system by biofilms, or in sites where the immune components are limited-in the nervous system, the stomach, or inside macrophages.Antibiotic treatment during a prolonged chronic infection of P. aeruginosa in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis selects for high-persister (hip) mutants. Similarly, treatment of oral thrush infection selects for hip mutants of C. albicans. These observations suggest a direct causality between persisters and recalcitrance of the disease. It appears that tolerance of persisters plays a leading role in chronic infections, while resistance is the leading cause of recalcitrance to therapy in acute infections. Studies of persister formation in E. coli show that mechanisms of dormancy are highly redundant. Isolation of persisters produced a transcriptome which suggests a dormant phenotype characterized by downregulation of energy-producing and biosynthetic functions. Toxin-antitoxin modules represent a major mechanism of persister formation. The RelE toxin causes dormancy by cleaving mRNA; the HipA toxin inhibits translation by phosphorylating elongation factor Ef-Tu, and the TisB toxin forms a membrane pore, leading to a decrease in pmf and ATP.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23090737	SMAD4 haploinsufficiency associates with augmented colonic inflammation in select humans and mice	SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23109496	Management of severe epistaxis after Young's procedure: a case report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting multiple organ systems, with epistaxis being the most common manifestation. Multiple procedures have been used for the management of epistaxis in the setting of HHT, including closure of the anterior nares via a Young's procedure. While this procedure results in loss of smell and permanent nasal obstruction, proponents note significant improvement in patient symptomatology. Case report. A 70-year-old female with a history of HHT presented to an outside hospital with bleeding into the nasopharynx 2 months after undergoing a modified Young's procedure at an unaffiliated institution. She was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and transferred to our facility. Due to persistent epistaxis and need for airway protection, the patient was intubated and her throat was packed. She also developed aspiration pneumonia and hypotensive shock requiring vasopressors. Twenty-four hours following bilateral internal maxillary and sphenopalatine artery embolization, she developed significant epistaxis requiring reversal of the Young's procedure on the left and placement of an anterior-posterior pack at the bedside. Upon packing removal several days later in the operating room, she was noted to have significant bleeding that necessitated reversal of the Young's procedure on the right side to obtain adequate exposure and hemostasis. We report a case of significant, life-threatening epistaxis following a modified Young's procedure that requiring multiple transfusions, bilateral embolization, and ultimately reversal of the Young's procedure for control of epistaxis. Although recognized as a potential complication, to our knowledge this is the first report in the English literature of such a case.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

23140956	"Online trapping and enrichment ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for sensitive measurement of ""arginine-asymmetric dimethylarginine cycle"" biomarkers in human exhaled breath condensate"	"Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a biofluid collected non invasively that, enabling the measurement of several biomarkers, has proven useful in the study of airway inflammatory diseases, including asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report of any analytical method to detect ADMA in EBC. Aim of this work was to develop an online sample trapping and enrichment system, coupled with an UPLC-MS/MS method, for simultaneous quantification of seven metabolites related to ""Arginine-ADMA cycle"", using the isotopic dilution. Butylated EBC samples were trapped in an online cartridge, washed before and after each injection with cleanup solution to remove matrix components and switched inline into the high pressure analytical column. Multiple reaction monitoring in positive mode was used for analyte quantification by tandem mass spectrometry. Validation studies were performed in EBC to examine accuracy, precision and robustness of the method. For each compound, the calibration curves showed a coefficient of correlation (r(2)) greater than 0.992. Accuracy (%Bias) was <3% except for NMMA and H-Arg (<20%), intra- and inter-assay precision (expressed as CV%) were within ±20% and recovery ranged from 97.1 to 102.8% for all analytes.

ADMA and SDMA mean concentrations (μmolL(-1)), measured in EBC samples of asthmatic adolescents are significantly increased (p<0.0001) than in normal controls (0.0040±0.0021 vs. 0.0012±0.0005 and 0.0020±0.0015 vs. 0.0002±0.0001, respectively), as well the ADMA/Tyr (0.34±0.09 vs. 0.12±0.02, p<0.0001) and the SDMA/Tyr ratio (0.10±0.04 vs. 0.015±0.004, p<0.0001). The proposed method features simple specimen preparation, maintenance of an excellent peak shape of all metabolites and reduced matrix effects as well mass spectrometer noise. Moreover, the possibility to perform different cycles of enrichment, using large injection volumes, compensated for the low concentration of analytes contained in EBC, leading to a good analytical sensitivity.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY		435	"... , COPD and cystic fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report of any analytical method to detect ADMA in EBC. Aim of this work was to develop an online sample trapping and enrichment system, coupled with an UPLC-MS/MS method, for simultaneous quantification of seven metabolites related to ""Arginine-ADMA cycle"", using the isotopic dilution. Butylated EBC samples were trapped in an online cartridge, washed before and after each injection with cleanup solution to remove matrix components and switched inline into the high pressure analytical column. Multiple reaction monitoring in positive mode was used for analyte quantification by tandem mass spectrometry. Validation studies were performed in EBC to examine accuracy, precision and robustness of the method. For each compound, the calibration curves showed a coefficient of correlation (r(2)) greater than 0.992. Accuracy (%Bias) was <3% except for NMMA and H-Arg (<20%), intra- and inter-assay precision (expressed as CV%) were within ±20% and recovery ranged from 97.1 to 102.8% for all analytes.

For transfusion-dependent patients with severe epistaxis we have been performing the Young's procedure or surgical closure of the nostrils. The objective of this study was to report treatment of severe epistaxis related to HHT with the Young's procedure and assess patient outcome. Patients with severe iron or blood transfusion-dependent epistaxis who underwent a Young's procedure in three otolaryngology HHT centers were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for postoperative epistaxis and subjective outcome. Forty-three patients underwent a Young's procedure for severe epistaxis and were observed for a mean of 34 months. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients and 30 of 36 patients (83%) experienced complete cessation of bleeding after the Young's procedure. Patients had a mean increase in hemoglobin of 4.68 g/dL after the procedure. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory score after surgery was 43.56. No patients requested a reversal of the procedure. The Young's procedure is a safe and efficacious procedure with complete cessation of epistaxis in most patients with severe epistaxis and HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

23169612	Chest CT in bronchopulmonary dysplasia: clinical and radiological correlations	Chest CT is very sensitive in assessing pulmonary damage in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and radiological findings in BPD are well described. Validated CT scores are available to assess BPD, as available in other pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis. To investigate whether there is a correlation between radiological pulmonary lesions and relevant BPD clinical data (gestational age, type and duration of mechanical ventilation, and severity of BPD) and assess the usefulness of a CT score in evaluating clinical severity. Retrospective study of 19 premature infants with BPD born between 1998 and 2007 who underwent at least one chest CT during their first year of life. A total of 29 CT were blindly evaluated by two radiologists for the presence or absence of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities described in BPD (areas of decreased attenuation, presence of bullae/emphysema, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, linear, and subpleural opacities). This score was then compared with the most relevant clinical data. All CT scans showed abnormalities. The most frequent lesion was bronchial wall thickening observed in all patients, followed by linear (89.5%) and subpleural (89.5%) opacities. Areas of decreased attenuation were found in 68.4%. Bullae/emphysema and bronchiectasis were the less frequent item described (26.3% and 21.1%, respectively). The presence of areas of decreased attenuation significantly correlated with BPD severity (P = 0.03). However, there was no significant correlation between the CT score and clinical data. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of chest CT score to assess the severity of BPD. Areas of decreased attenuation seem the most sensitive item to predict BPD severity. More patients are needed to validate this approach and to evaluate the long-term usefulness of CT scan.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

23192669	A pilot study of the characterization of hepatic tissue strain in children with cystic-fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD) by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging	Progressive fibrotic alterations of liver tissue represent a major complication in children with cystic fibrosis. Correct assessment of cystic-fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD) in clinical routine is a challenging issue. Sonographic elastography based on acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) is a new noninvasive approach for quantitatively assessing in vivo elasticity of biological tissues in many organs. To characterize ARFI elastography as a diagnostic tool to assess alteration of liver tissue elasticity related to cystic fibrosis in children. ARFI elastography and B-mode US imaging were performed in 36 children with cystic fibrosis. The children's clinical history and laboratory parameters were documented. According to the findings on conventional US, children were assigned to distinct groups indicating severity of hepatic tissue alterations. The relationship between US findings and respective elastography values was assessed. Additionally, differences between ARFI elastography values of each US group were statistically tested. Children with sonomorphologic characteristics of fibrotic tissue remodeling presented significantly increased values for tissue elasticity. Children with normal B-mode US or discrete signs of hepatic tissue alterations showed a tendency toward increased tissue stiffness indicating early tissue remodeling. Assessment of children with CFLD by means of ARFI elastography yields adequate results when compared to conventional US. For detection of early stages of liver disease with mild fibrotic reactions of hepatic tissue, ARFI elastography might offer diagnostic advantages over conventional US. Thus, liver stiffness measured by means of elastography might represent a valuable biological parameter for evaluation and follow-up of CFLD.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

23195144	Association among posture, lung function and functional capacity in cystic fibrosis	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations within pulmonary function, functional capacity, and posture in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between patient quality of life and postural assessment variables. A cross-sectional study was conducted on fourteen patients with CF. Patients were subjected to a postural analysis (postural assessment software) and measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry, whole body plethysmography, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity) and functional capacity (6-min walking test). All patients completed the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). Most patients were male (57%), and the median age of the patients was 24.5 (22-34). The forced expiratory volume in one second, the 6-min walking distance, total lung capacity, and airway resistance were significantly correlated with the vertical alignment of the chest (ρ = -0.57, P < 0.05; ρ = -0.65, P < 0.01; ρ = 0.54, P < 0.05; and ρ = 0.67, P < 0.01, respectively). The 'physical' domain of the CFQ-R was significantly correlated with the vertical alignment of the chest (ρ = -0.74, P < 0.01), and the 'limitations' domain of the CFQ-R was significantly correlated with the angle of the hip (ρ = -0.55, P < 0.05). The present study shows that abnormalities in pulmonary function and functional capacity are associated with postural changes in adults with CF. However the severity of the postural abnormalities does not negatively influence the CFQ-R domains.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

23199770	A new location of angiokeratoma circumscriptum	Angiokeratomas are papular telangiectasias having a common histology of ectasia of the superficial dermal vessels surmounted by a hyperkeratotic epidermis. The patient was a 9-year-old girl born of non-consanguineous parents after a well-followed pregnancy with problem-free delivery at term. From birth, she had a tumefaction of the left side of the nose and the left half of the upper lip that gradually increased in size without obstructing the nasal orifice and bled easily. Examination revealed the presence of tumefaction of the left nostril and the left half of the upper lip projecting towards the contralateral side especially in the nose. It was soft and painless, with the presence at the surface of dull red keratotic papules of 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Examination of the nasal mucosa revealed the same appearance of papules. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare congenital malformation, the rarest of five types. Since its initial description in 1890, few cases have been reported. However, female predominance has been noted with a male/female sex ratio of 1/3. It appears to be due to a genetic mutation that is probably autosomal, but the site of which is still unknown. In view of the special features of this case, several diagnoses were suggested, including Rendu Osler's disease, superficial lymphangioma and verrucous angioma. The particularity of this case is that it includes the first description of this site, which posed a therapeutic problem, especially concerning the choice of laser type to be used.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

In the classification of the International League Against Epilepsy eight age-related epileptic encephalopathy syndromes are recognized. These syndromes include early myoclonic encephalopathy and Ohtahara syndrome in the neonatal period, West syndrome and Dravet syndrome in infancy, myoclonic status in nonprogressive encephalopathies, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and epilepsy with continuous spike waves during slow wave sleep in childhood and adolescences. Other epileptic syndromes such as migrating partial seizures in infancy and severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci may be reasonably added. In this paper, we provide an overview of epileptic encephalopathies including clinical neurophysiological features, cognitive deterioration, and management options especially that these conditions are generally refractory to standard antiepileptic drugs.

23217263	Jejunoileal atresia and cystic fibrosis: don't miss it	While an increased prevalence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with jejunal atresia and ileal atresia (JIA) has been described previously, it still may not be a practice routine to indicate a sweat test or DNA test for CFTR mutations in newborns presenting with JIA. Leading textbooks do not mention JIA as a possible presenting clinical feature of CF. We describe two cases of JIA with a delayed diagnosis of CF (4 months [post mortem] and 19 months). This led to a retrospective review of all patients with JIA in our hospital. We hypothesised that also in the past although indicated further testing for CF had not always been performed. Over an 18-year period from January 1991 until December 2008, all cases of JIA in our centre were reviewed (n=50). We compared patients who have been tested for CF (n=18) with patients who have not been tested for CF (n=32), with respect to their patient characteristics, either by logistic regression analysis or a nonparametric test (p<0.05). Of all 50 patients the proportion of infants actually tested for CF was 18 (36%). A statistical significant difference between the group of patients who were tested for CF versus the group of those who were not tested was found in a higher occurrence of postoperative bilious retention after 7 days (56% versus 25%, respectively), and postoperative complications (78% versus 34%, respectively). CF was confirmed in 4 (8%). Testing for CF in newborns presenting with JIA does not appear to be common practice. A timely diagnosis of CF leads to presymptomatic treatment and has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality. CF should be tested for in all children with JIA. We recommend a sweat test for term children and CFTR DNA testing as a first step for preterm infants. Medical professional awareness may be increased if future editions of leading text books in the relevant fields should include JIA as an indication to follow an appropriate CF-diagnostic algorithm.

23230532	Vagal nerve stimulation for pharmacoresistant epilepsy in children	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Little is known about VNS therapy for children with epilepsy. This article will: (1) Review the contemporary medical literature related to VNS therapy in children with epilepsy, (2) describe the experience of VNS treatment in 153 children less than 18 years of age, in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Program, from 1998 to 2012, and (3) describe the surgical technique used for VNS implantation at UCLA. Review of the literature finds that despite different etiologies and epilepsy syndromes in children, VNS appears to show a similar profile of efficacy for seizure control compared to adults, and low morbidity and mortality. The UCLA experience is similar to that reported in the literature for children. VNS constitutes about 21% of our pediatric epilepsy surgery volume. We have implanted VNS in infants as young as six months of age and the most common etiology is the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. About 5% of the patients are seizure-free with VNS therapy and there is a low rate of surgically related complications. The UCLA surgical approach emphasizes minimal direct manipulation of the vagus nerve and adequate wire loops, to prevent a lead fracture. In summary, VNS is a viable palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy in children, with outcomes and complications equal to adult patients. Being a small child is not a contraindication for VNS therapy, if needed for refractory epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		287	Vagal nerve stimulation for pharmacoresistant epilepsy in children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Little is known about VNS therapy for children with epilepsy. This article will: (1) Review the contemporary medical literature related to VNS therapy in children with epilepsy, (2) describe the experience of VNS treatment in 153 children less than 18 years of age, in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Program, from 1998 to 2012, and (3) describe the surgical technique used for VNS implantation at UCLA. Review of the literature finds that despite different etiologies and epilepsy syndromes in children, VNS appears to show a similar profile of efficacy for seizure control compared to adults, and low morbidity and mortality. The UCLA experience is similar to that reported in the literature for children. VNS constitutes about 21% of our pediatric epilepsy surgery volume. We have implanted VNS in infants as young as six months of age and the most common etiology is the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. About 5% of the patients are seizure-free with VNS therapy and there is a low rate of surgically related complications. The UCLA surgical approach emphasizes minimal direct manipulation of the vagus nerve and adequate wire loops, to prevent a lead fracture. In summary, VNS is a viable palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy in children, with outcomes and complications equal to adult patients. Being a small child is not a contraindication for VNS therapy, if needed for refractory epilepsy.
23232196	Does hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia affect olfactory or gustatory function?	"The olfactory and gustatory functions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients have not been documented by validated tests. Disorders of the nasal/oral cavity may interfere with the olfactory and gustatory functions. Fifty-four HHT patients were investigated by smell/taste tests. HHT patients provided subjective ratings in areas such as ability to perceive smell/taste. ""Sniffin' Sticks"" were used for smell tests, and taste strips were used for taste tests. HHT patients rated their subjective olfactory and gustatory function on a visual analog scale from 0 (none) to 100 (high) as 65.3 ± 27.7 and 68.1 ± 25.1, respectively. Comparison of smell test results of HHT patients with normative data of sex- and age-matched controls from Hummel et al. revealed that HHT patients had lower threshold values, whereas there was no difference in identification and discrimination values. HHT patients were hyposmic. In the case of taste qualities, all values (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) in HHT patients were lower than those in normative data of Mueller et al. However, HHT patients were not hypogeusic. The duration of disease, extranasal manifestation, and treatments did not significantly correlate with smell/taste test values. Compared with healthy people, HHT patients exhibit reduced olfactory and gustatory function; however, HHT patients are hyposmic and not hypogeusic. This chemosensory deficit may highlight an early sign of disease and has no correlation with disease severity. HHT patients should be informed about these potential disease manifestations, thus enabling them to improve their quality of life."	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

23246127	High prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder causing mucocutaneous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered an uncommon complication of HHT whose impact on the survival of these patients is currently unknown. From January 1995 to December 2008, 29 hospitalized patients with definite HHT were included and followed until January 2011. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms and survival were recorded. PH was classified according to echocardiographic probability. A CT angiogram was performed in 24 of the 29 patients with HHT and AVMs were detected in 16 of them (67%): hepatic in 58%, pulmonary in 33% and spinal in 3%; 37% had both pulmonary and hepatic AVMs. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 21 patients. PH was considered possible in 4 (14%) and probable in 9 (31%). The mean age at diagnosis was lower in patients with PH than in patients without PH (54±16.5 years vs 73±8.8 years, p=0.002). PH was more prevalent in patients with AVMs (56 vs. 23%, p=0.036). The mean follow-up of the entire cohort was 6±4.4 years (range: 2 months-17 years), during this time 18 patients died (62%; mean age 73±8.1 years). Patients with PH died at a younger age (68±8.4 vs. 79±2.7 years, p=0.015) than those without PH. PH is a severe condition that significantly reduces survival on HHT patients. PH should be suspected in all HHT patients with dyspnea and hepatic AVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

23252400	West syndrome caused by ST3Gal-III deficiency	West syndrome consists of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental arrest. Most patients remain mentally retarded and many develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing we identified an ST3GAL3 mutation in three infants with West syndrome. ST3GAL3 encodes a sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of sialyl-Lewis epitopes on cell surface-expressed glycoproteins. The mutation affected an essential sialyl-motif and abolished enzymatic activity. Abnormalities in proteins involved in forebrain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic growth and function were recently proposed to account for infantile spasms. Dysfunctional ST3GAL3 may thus result in perturbation of the posttranslational sialylation of proteins in these pathways.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

23271804	Tangled bank of experimentally evolved Burkholderia biofilms reflects selection during chronic infections	How diversity evolves and persists in biofilms is essential for understanding much of microbial life, including the uncertain dynamics of chronic infections. **We developed a biofilm model enabling long-term selection for daily adherence to and dispersal from a plastic bead in a test tube**. Focusing on a pathogen of the cystic fibrosis lung, Burkholderia cenocepacia, we sequenced clones and metagenomes to unravel the mutations and evolutionary forces responsible for adaptation and diversification of a single biofilm community during 1,050 generations of selection. The mutational patterns revealed recurrent evolution of biofilm specialists from generalist types and multiple adaptive alleles at relatively few loci. Fitness assays also demonstrated strong interference competition among contending mutants that preserved genetic diversity. Metagenomes from five other independently evolved biofilm lineages revealed extraordinary mutational parallelism that outlined common routes of adaptation, a subset of which was found, surprisingly, in a planktonic population. These mutations in turn were surprisingly well represented among mutations that evolved in cystic fibrosis isolates of both Burkholderia and Pseudomonas. These convergent pathways included altered metabolism of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate, polysaccharide production, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, global transcription, and iron scavenging. Evolution in chronic infections therefore may be driven by mutations in relatively few pathways also favored during laboratory selection, creating hope that experimental evolution may illuminate the ecology and selective dynamics of chronic infections and improve treatment strategies.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23312966	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, liver vascular malformations and cardiac consequences	HHT patients with liver vascular malformations (VMs) may develop high-output cardiac failure requiring liver transplant in few cases. Our aim is to show that echocardiography is a good tool to evaluate the severity of hepatic vascular malformations in HHT and can improve medical management in HHT patients. The study is a cross-sectional study of cardiac parameters in HHT patients with dyspnea in a single referral center. All HHT patients with dyspnea, consecutively seen at HHT reference center in Lyon between May 2007 and November 2009 were included and had hepatic vascular Ultrasound and Echocardiography. Echocardiographic measures included cardiac output (CO) and index (CI), left ventricle (LV) filling pressures, and pulmonary artery pressure. Then, patients were classified in 4 groups according to the severity: group 1 (normal values), group 2 with isolated high CI, group 3 with high CI and increased LV-filling pressures and group 4 with increased LV-filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-two HHT-patients were analyzed. Eight patients were in group 1, 25 in group 2, 6 in group 3 and 13 in group 4. Age, NYHA class dyspnea, edema, atrial fibrillation, hepatic artery diameter, and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels significantly increased from groups 1 to 4 as well as left atrial area, and presence of mitral regurgitation. Patients with associated pulmonary VMs (n=11) did not show any clinical or echocardiographic differences. Performing echocardiography in HHT patients with dyspnea allowed us to better understand the physiological processes of high-CO failure complicating liver vascular malformations and may improve follow-up of patients and treatment decisions.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

23320130	Oxidative stress contributes to endothelial dysfunction in mouse models of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) or activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1; HHT2) genes, coding for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily receptors. We demonstrated previously that endoglin and ALK1 interact with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and affect its activation. Endothelial cells deficient in endoglin or ALK1 proteins show eNOS uncoupling, reduced NO, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this study, we measured NO and H(2)O(2) levels in several organs of adult Eng and Alk1 heterozygous mice, to ascertain whether decreased NO and increased ROS production is a generalized manifestation of HHT. A significant reduction in NO and increase in ROS production were found in several organs, known to be affected in patients. ROS overproduction in mutant mice was attributed to eNOS, as it was L-NAME inhibitable. Mitochondrial ROS contribution, blocked by antimycin, was highest in liver while NADPH oxidase, inhibited by apocynin, was a major source of ROS in the other tissues. However, there was no difference in antimycin- and apocynin-inhibitable ROS production between mutant and control mice. Our results indicate that eNOS-derived ROS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and likely predisposes to disease manifestations in several organs of HHT patients.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23354062	Localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using frequency domain source imaging of intracranial electroencephalography: a preliminary investigation	Although intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) has been widely used to localize epileptogenic zones in epilepsy, visual inspection of iEEG recordings does not always result in a favorable surgical outcome, especially in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Various computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been introduced to confirm the visual inspection results. Of these methods, high gamma oscillation in iEEG has attracted interest because a series of studies have reported a close relationship between epileptogenic zones and cortical areas with high gamma oscillation. Meanwhile, frequency domain source imaging of EEG and MEG oscillations has proven to be a useful auxiliary tool for identifying rough locations of epileptogenic zones. To the best of our knowledge, however, frequency domain source imaging of high gamma iEEG oscillations has not been studied. **In this study, we investigated whether the iEEG-based frequency domain source imaging of high gamma oscillation (60-100 Hz) would be a useful supplementary tool for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy**. The method was applied to three successfully operated on LGS patients, whose iEEG contained some ictal events with distinct high gamma oscillations before seizure onset. The resultant cortical source distributions were compared with surgical resection areas and with high gamma spectral power distributions on the intracranial sensor plane. While the results of the sensor-level analyses contained many spurious activities, the results of frequency domain source imaging coincided better with the surgical resection areas, suggesting that the frequency domain source imaging of iEEG high gamma oscillations might help enhance the accuracy of pre-surgical evaluations of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy.

23354748	AmrZ modulates Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm architecture by directly repressing transcription of the psl operon	Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains recovered from chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients are frequently mucoid. Such strains express elevated levels of alginate but reduced levels of the aggregative polysaccharide Psl; however, the mechanistic basis for this regulation is not completely understood. Elevated pslA expression was observed in an amrZ null mutant and in strains expressing a DNA-binding-deficient AmrZ. AmrZ is a transcription factor that positively regulates twitching motility and alginate synthesis, two phenotypes involved in P. aeruginosa biofilm development. AmrZ bound directly to the pslA promoter in vitro, and molecular analyses indicate that AmrZ represses psl expression by binding to a site overlapping the promoter. Altered expression of amrZ in nonmucoid strains impacted biofilm structure and architecture, as structured microcolonies were observed with low AmrZ production and flat biofilms with amrZ overexpression. These biofilm phenotypes correlated with Psl levels, since we observed elevated Psl production in amrZ mutants and lower Psl production in amrZ-overexpressing strains. These observations support the hypothesis that AmrZ is a multifunctional regulator mediating transition of P. aeruginosa biofilm infections from colonizing to chronic biofilms through repression of the psl operon while activating the algD operon.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Exhaled breath was analyzed by electronic nose in 25 children with CF, 25 with PCD and 23 controls. Principle component reduction and canonical discriminant analysis were used to construct internally cross-validated ROC curves. CF and PCD patients had significantly different breath profiles when compared to healthy controls (CF: sensitivity 84%, specificity 65%; PCD: sensitivity 88%, specificity 52%) and from each other (sensitivity 84%, specificity 60%). Patients with and without exacerbations had significantly different breath profiles (CF: sensitivity 89%, specificity 56%; PCD: sensitivity 100%, specificity 90%). Exhaled molecular profiles significantly differ between patients with CF, PCD and controls.

Associations between sweat conductivity measurements and age, gender, (pH, HCO(3), pCO(2), Na, K, Cl), family history, consanguinity, indications for the test and number of hospitalization were studied. Among 2,664 patients, 16 children had sweat conductivity values higher than 80. The median age of patients diagnosed with CF was 4 months old. Age, pH, HCO(3), Na, Cl, K and the sweat conductivity test were statistically related (P < 0.001). The ROC curve showed very high agreement between the 2nd conductivity test and the sweat test. Patients suspected to have CF can be screened using the Nanoduct(®) conductivity device in non-qualified centers.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

Associations between sweat conductivity measurements and age, gender, (pH, HCO(3), pCO(2), Na, K, Cl), family history, consanguinity, indications for the test and number of hospitalization were studied. Among 2,664 patients, 16 children had sweat conductivity values higher than 80. The median age of patients diagnosed with CF was 4 months old. Age, pH, HCO(3), Na, Cl, K and the sweat conductivity test were statistically related (P < 0.001). The ROC curve showed very high agreement between the 2nd conductivity test and the sweat test. Patients suspected to have CF can be screened using the Nanoduct(®) conductivity device in non-qualified centers.

Therefore, we screened a cohort of 160 patients with an unexplained EE, including patients with early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, nonsyndromic EE with onset in the first year, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). **We found six de novo mutations in six patients presenting as Ohtahara syndrome (2/6, 33%), West syndrome (1/65, 2%), and nonsyndromic early onset EE (3/64, 5%**). No mutations were found in LGS or EME. Only two of four mutation carriers with neonatal seizures had Ohtahara syndrome. **Epileptic spasms were present in five of six patients. One patient with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but focal seizures underwent epilepsy surgery and seizure frequency dropped drastically. **Neuropathology showed a focal cortical dysplasia type 1a.

23415449	Copy number variants in adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome features	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy with complex etiology. To explore possible genetic predispositions and causes of LGS, we have searched for copy number variants (CNVs). We studied 21 patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy for CNVs using whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Eight patients (38%) carried rare CNVs that might contribute to their phenotype. The pathogenicity could be questioned in some of them, but in four patients (19%) a causative role was considered highly probable. Three had CNVs and clinical features consistent with known genetic syndromes: 22q13.3 deletion, 2q23.1 deletion, and MECP2 duplication. There is a high frequency of rare CNVs in adult patients with LGS-like epilepsy. The phenotypes of these background disorders may be obscured by the effects of intractable seizures and massive antiepileptic drug treatment. Previously, syndromic disorders were primarily identified by their clinical features; however, a genome wide approach with identification of the genotype might shed light on the phenotype.

23465587	Polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet therapy for a child with epilepsy	The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet with an established efficacy for treating medically refractory epilepsy in children. Fatty acids are the most important constituent of the KD in all aspects of efficacy and complications. Among fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increase anticonvulsant properties and reduce the complications associated with the high-fat diet. Here, we report a 7-year-old boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome combined with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency, whose medically intractable seizures have been successfully controlled with a PUFA-enriched modified Atkins diet without any significant adverse events. The diet consists of canola oil and diverse menu items like fish and nuts instead of olive oil and has an ideal 1:2.8 ratio of omega-3 to omega-6. In addition, fractionation of this boy's plasma showed normal levels of fatty acids, including omega-3 (alpha-linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid, arachidonic acid) as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid). Plasma docosahexanoic acid remained low after PUFA-enriched diet therapy. PUFA-enriched diet therapy is likely to increase the efficacy of diet therapy and reduce complications of a high-fat diet in children with refractory epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

23489890	Clinical analysis of catastrophic epilepsy in infancy and early childhood: results of the Far-East Asia Catastrophic Epilepsy (FACE) study group	We studied children younger than 6years old who developed catastrophic epilepsy and were registered in the FACE study group to clarify their clinical characteristics and prevalence of seizure as well as epilepsy types. Subjects were prospectively recruited from children with epilepsy who satisfied the following criteria and underwent intensive examination between 2009 and 2012 in 14 collaborative centers: (1) younger than 6years old and (2) more than 10 seizures/month refractory to all available medical treatments including ACTH therapy, leading to significant psychosocial morbidity. We analyzed epilepsy onset age, predominant seizure type, etiology, neuropsychological findings, and syndromic classification according to the pre-determined registration format. A total of 314 children were enrolled in this study. Epilepsy onset age in 239 cases (80%) was younger than 12months. The most frequent seizure type was epileptic spasms (ES), followed by generalized tonic seizures (GTS), which accounted for 42% and 20%, respectively. West syndrome (WS) was the most frequent epileptic syndrome and accounted for 37%, followed by unclassified epilepsy at 21%, neocortical epilepsy at 19%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at 12%, Dravet syndrome at 4%, Rasmussen syndrome at 2%, and others. The two most frequent causes of epilepsy were cortical dysplasia and chromosomal anomalies, as shown in 16% and 6%, respectively. However, the etiology of nearly one half of all patients remained unknown. Psychomotor development was already worse than a moderate degree in 62% of subjects at the first examination. The highest proportion of catastrophic epilepsy was WS and its related syndromes featuring ES and GTS, followed by neocortical epilepsy, whose psychomotor development was significantly retarded at examinations.

23504457	MAST205 competes with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-associated ligand for binding to CFTR to regulate CFTR-mediated fluid transport.	The PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1) domain-based interactions play important roles in regulating the expression and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several PDZ domain-containing proteins (PDZ proteins for short) have been identified as directly or indirectly interacting with the C terminus of CFTR. To better understand the regulation of CFTR processing, we conducted a genetic screen and identified MAST205 (a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 205 kDa) as a new CFTR regulator. We found that overexpression of MAST205 increased the expression of CFTR and augmented CFTR-mediated fluid transport in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of MAST205 inhibited CFTR function. The PDZ motif of CFTR is required for the regulatory role of MAST205 in CFTR expression and function. We further demonstrated that MAST205 and the CFTR-associated ligand competed for binding to CFTR, which facilitated the processing of CFTR and consequently up-regulated the expression and function of CFTR at the plasma membrane. More importantly, we found that MAST205 could facilitate the processing of F508del-CFTR mutant and augment its quantity and channel function at the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data suggest that MAST205 plays an important role in regulating CFTR expression and function. Our findings have important clinical implications for treating CFTR-associated diseases such as cystic fibrosis and secretory diarrheas.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23527104	The protein kinase TPL2 is essential for ERK1/ERK2 activation and cytokine gene expression in airway epithelial cells exposed to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)	The epithelium forms a physical barrier important to the detection of pathogens. P. aeruginosa infections are frequently encountered in Cystic Fibrosis lungs, lead to ERK1/ERK2 activation and contribute to tissue destruction. We report here that in bronchial airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), diffusible material from P. aeruginosa and TLR2, TLR3 and TLR5 ligands activates ERK1/ERK2 via the protein kinase TPL2 and not the growth factor receptor EGFR. Activation of TPL2 by these agonists in airway epithelial cells requires the protein kinases TAK1 and IKKβ in accordance with the previously reported model of activation of TPL2 in macrophages. Inhibition of TPL2 activity with a pharmacological inhibitor (Compound 1) not only prevented ERK1/ERK2 activation but also decreased cytokine synthesis in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These results suggest that inhibition of the protein kinase TPL2 is an attractive strategy to decrease inflammation in the lungs when it is not warranted.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23532242	Effect of long-term, low-dose erythromycin on pulmonary exacerbations among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: the BLESS randomized controlled trial	Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin may improve clinical outcomes in non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, although associated risks of macrolide resistance are poorly defined. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial resistance cost of low-dose erythromycin given for 12 months to patients with non-CF bronchiectasis with a history of frequent pulmonary exacerbations. Twelve-month, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin in currently nonsmoking, adult patients with non-CF bronchiectasis with a history of 2 or more infective exacerbations in the preceding year. This Australian study was undertaken between October 2008 and December 2011 in a university teaching hospital, with participants also recruited via respiratory physicians at other centers and from public radio advertisements. Twice-daily erythromycin ethylsuccinate (400 mg) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was the annualized mean rate of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations (PDPEs) per patient. Secondary outcomes included macrolide resistance in commensal oropharyngeal streptococci and lung function. Six-hundred seventy-nine patients were screened, 117 were randomized (58 placebo, 59 erythromycin), and 107 (91.5%) completed the study. Erythromycin significantly reduced PDPEs both overall (mean, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.93-1.65] vs 1.97 [95% CI, 1.45-2.48] per patient per year; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42-0.77]; P = .003), and in the prespecified subgroup with baseline Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection (mean difference, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.19-2.46]; P = .02). Erythromycin reduced 24-hour sputum production (median difference, 4.3 g [interquartile range [IQR], 1 to 7.8], P = .01) and attenuated lung function decline (mean absolute difference for change in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration, 2.2 percent predicted [95% CI, 0.1% to 4.3%]; P = .04) compared with placebo. Erythromycin increased the proportion of macrolide-resistant oropharyngeal streptococci (median change, 27.7% [IQR, 0.04% to 41.1%] vs 0.04% [IQR, -1.6% to 1.5%]; difference, 25.5% [IQR,15.0% to 33.7%]; P < .001). Among patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, the 12-month use of erythromycin compared with placebo resulted in a modest decrease in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and an increased rate of macrolide resistance. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609000578202.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

23636454	RACK1 interacts with filamin-A to regulate plasma membrane levels of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator	Mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel in the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, underlie the fatal genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. Certain CFTR mutations, including the common mutation ΔF508-CFTR, result in greatly decreased levels of active CFTR at the apical membrane. Direct interactions between CFTR and the cytoskeletal adaptors filamin-A (FlnA) and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) stabilize the expression and localization of CFTR at the plasma membrane. The scaffold protein receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) also stabilizes CFTR surface expression; however, RACK1 does not interact directly with CFTR and its mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we report that RACK1 interacts directly with FlnA in vitro and in a Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line. We mapped the interaction between RACK1 and FlnA to the WD4 and WD6 repeats of RACK1 and to a segment of the large rod domain of FlnA, consisting of immunoglobulin-like repeats 8-15. Disruption of the RACK1-FlnA interaction causes a reduction in CFTR surface levels. Our results suggest that a novel RACK1-FlnA interaction is an important regulator of CFTR surface localization.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1 account for around 85% of cases, and 10% are large deletions and duplications. Here we present a large novel deletion in ACVRL1 gene and its molecular characterization in a 3 generation Italian family. We employed short tandem repeats (STRs) analysis, direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, and 'deletion-specific' PCR methods. STRs Analysis at ENG and ACVRL1 loci suggested a positive linkage for ACVRL1. Direct sequencing of this gene did not identify any mutations, while MLPA identified a large deletion. These results were confirmed and exactly characterized with a 'deletion-specific' PCR: the deletion size is 4,594 bp and breakpoints in exon 3 and intron 8 show the presence of short direct repeats of 7 bp [GCCCCAC]. We hypothesize, as causative molecular mechanism, the replication slippage model. Understanding the fine mechanisms associated with genomic rearrangements may indicate the nonrandomness of these events, highlighting hot spots regions. The complete concordance among MLPA, STRs analysis and 'deletion-specific PCR' supports the usefulness of MLPA in HHT molecular analysis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23670536	The effect of anterior palatine blocks on bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia nasal surgery	When combined with local sphenopalatine (SP) injection and moderate hypotension, transoral or transcutaneous local injection of the anterior palatine (AP) vessels reduces intraoperative bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) patients undergoing nasal surgery. Retrospective chart review of 55 consecutive HHT patients undergoing a bevacizumab injection for recalcitrant epistaxis. Nineteen patients received local injections to only the SP vasculature, and 36 patients received AP and SP injections. Main outcome variable was estimated blood loss during nasal surgery. Independent variables included sex, age, epistaxis severity score, surgical techniques (including laser), and blood pressure parameters (baseline, preinduction, and postintubation). The mean blood loss in HHT patients receiving SP injections alone was 111 mL, whereas it was 22 mL for those receiving both AP + SP injections. This difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = .075). Blood pressure parameters were similar in both groups with no appreciable difference between intraoperative systolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The addition of either sublabial or transcutaneous AP injection to the standard SP block markedly reduces blood loss in HHT epistaxis nasal surgery.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

23675457	Enhanced responses to angiogenic cues underlie the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2	Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic vascular disease in which arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) manifest in skin and multiple visceral organs. HHT is caused by heterozygous mutations in endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), or SMAD4. ALK1 regulates angiogenesis, but the precise function of ALK1 in endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. Since most blood vessels of HHT patients do not produce pathological vascular lesions, ALK1 heterozygous ECs may be normal unless additional genetic or environmental stresses are imposed. To investigate the cellular and biochemical phenotypes of Alk1-null versus Alk1-heterozygous ECs, we have generated pulmonary EC lines in which a genotype switch from the Alk1-conditional allele (Alk1 (2f)) to the Alk1-null allele (Alk1 (1f)) can be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Alk1-null (1 f/1 f) ECs displayed increased migratory properties in vitro in response to bFGF compared with Alk1-het (2 f/1 f) ECs. The 1 f/1 f-ECs formed a denser and more persistent tubular network as compared with their parental 2 f/1 f-ECs. Interestingly, the response to BMP-9 on SMAD1/5 phosphorylation was impaired in both 2 f/1 f- and 1 f/1 f-ECs at a comparable manner, suggesting that other factors in addition to SMADs may play a crucial role for enhanced angiogenic activity in 1 f/1 f-ECs. We also demonstrated in vivo that Alk1-deficient ECs exhibited high migratory and invasive properties. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced responses to angiogenic cues in ALK1-deficient ECs underlie the pathogenesis of HHT2.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

Based on the clinical presentation and radiological findings, a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was made and the cerebral ischemic complications were considered to have been caused by paradoxical embolizations related to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and identified turbulent thrombi in one of the PAVMs that were capable of circulating systemically and inducing embolic strokes. The condition of the patient improved immediately following VATS. This case suggests that VATS may be a preferred therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with PAVM accompanying recurrent episodes of life-threatening complications such as strokes.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

23702711	Three-dimensional co-cultures of human endothelial cells and embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes inside a microfluidic device	Organs-on-chips are microengineered in vitro tissue structures that can be used as platforms for physiological and pathological research. They provide tissue-like microenvironments in which different cell types can be co-cultured in a controlled manner to create synthetic organ mimics. Blood vessels are an integral part of all tissues in the human body. Development of vascular structures is therefore an important research topic for advancing the field of organs-on-chips since generated tissues will require a blood or nutrient supply. Here, we have engineered three-dimensional constructs of vascular tissue inside microchannels by injecting a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human embryonic stem cell-derived pericytes (the precursors of vascular smooth muscle cells) and rat tail collagen I into a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic channel with dimensions 500 μm × 120 μm × 1 cm (w × h × l). Over the course of 12 h, the cells organized themselves into a single long tube resembling a blood vessel that followed the contours of the channel. Detailed examination of tube morphology by confocal microscopy revealed a mature endothelial monolayer with complete PECAM-1 staining at cell-cell contacts and pericytes incorporated inside the tubular structures. We also demonstrated that tube formation was disrupted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The TGF-β signaling pathway is essential for normal vascular development; deletion of any of its components in mouse development results in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and mutations in humans have been linked to multiple vascular genetic diseases. In the engineered microvessels, inhibition of TGF-β signaling resulted in tubes with smaller diameters and higher tortuosity, highly reminiscent of the abnormal vessels observed in patients with one particular vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). In summary, we have developed microengineered three-dimensional vascular structures that can be used as a model to test the effects of drugs and study the interaction between different human vascular cell types. In the future, the model may be integrated into larger tissue constructs to advance the development of organs-on-chips.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

Clinical features of 23 family members in two HHT pedigrees were examined. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. PCR amplification was conducted to screen ENG and ACVRL-1 genes with their specific primers. Direct sequencing was performed to detect the mutation. Mutation analysis was carried out to evaluate its significance. A heterozygous c. 263A > G mutation was identified in exon 3 of ACVRL-1 in 6 out of 11 members in NMG-1 pedigree. In GD-2 pedigree, 5 of 11 members carried c. 199C > G mutation. Mutation detection rate was 100% in subjects with nosebleed history and 25% in family members without epistaxis. Gene diagnosis characterized by high sensitivity and specificity is of great practi-cal significance and early genetic screening should be a clinical routine test for HHT induced severe nosebleed.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23757023	Mechanosensitive ATP release maintains proper mucus hydration of airways	The clearance of mucus from the airways protects the lungs from inhaled noxious and infectious materials. Proper hydration of the mucus layer enables efficient mucus clearance through beating of cilia on airway epithelial cells, and reduced clearance of excessively concentrated mucus occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Key steps in the mucus transport process are airway epithelia sensing and responding to changes in mucus hydration. We reported that extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine were important luminal autocrine and paracrine signals that regulated the hydration of the surface of human airway epithelial cultures through their action on apical membrane purinoceptors. Mucus hydration in human airway epithelial cultures was sensed by an interaction between cilia and the overlying mucus layer: Changes in mechanical strain, proportional to mucus hydration, regulated ATP release rates, adjusting fluid secretion to optimize mucus layer hydration. This system provided a feedback mechanism by which airways maintained mucus hydration in an optimum range for cilia propulsion. Understanding how airway epithelia can sense and respond to changes in mucus properties helps us to understand how the mucus clearance system protects the airways in health and how it fails in lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23770633	Adjunctive Madopar for ultrarefractory epilepsy? Preliminary observations	The optimum drug treatment for ultrarefractory epilepsy after failure of seven prior antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) remains uncertain. Prompted by reports that adjunctive amantadine or l-dopa has been useful for children with refractory absence seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, we studied the utility of dopaminergic agents for adults with ultrarefractory epilepsy. We assessed seizure control following adjunctive treatment for up to 12 months with the dopaminergic agent Madopar© in three adult patients with ultrarefractory epilepsy following brain injury or with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, who had not achieved sustained seizure remission during past treatment with at least seven lifetime AEDs. The adjunctive use of Madopar was associated with a reduction or remission of tonic-clonic seizures in two patients. However, Madopar seemed to have aggravated absence seizures in the patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Although our preliminary observations do not and cannot establish the efficacy or safety of adjunctive Madopar, it may be an option for treatment of ultrarefractory focal seizures in adults if confirmed by randomized controlled trials.

To report a case of esophageal cancer in an adult patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and review the relationship between these 2 diseases. A 40-year-old man with CF presented with worsening epigastric pain, weight loss, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Endoscopy revealed innumerable masses in the distal esophagus. The workup revealed esophageal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver and the lungs. Abnormal mucous secretions in CF patients impair the innate GI mucosal barriers. The incidence of both gastroesophageal reflux disease and GI malignancies is higher in patients with CF. Patients with CF now survive long enough to potentially experience the consequences of long-term acid exposure, including esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal cancer. Our case report adds to a small but growing body of evidence that CF is a significant risk factor for GI malignancies, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. Controlled studies are needed to determine whether a causal relationship truly exists.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

23800974	MiR-205 is downregulated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and impairs TGF-beta signaling pathways in endothelial cells	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages. This vascular disease results mainly from mutations in 2 genes involved in the TGF-β pathway (ENG and ALK1) that are exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. The present study identified miR-27a and miR-205 as two circulating miRNAs differentially expressed in HHT patients. The plasma levels of miR-27a are elevated while those of miR-205 are reduced in both HHT1 and HHT2 patients compared to healthy controls. The role of miR-205 in endothelial cells was further investigated. Our data indicates that miR-205 expression displaces the TGF-β balance towards the anti-angiogenic side by targeting Smad1 and Smad4. In line, overexpression of miR-205 in endothelial cells reduces proliferation, migration and tube formation while its inhibition shows opposite effects. This study not only suggests that detection of circulating miRNA (miR-27a and miR-205) could help for the screening of HHT patients but also provides a functional link between the deregulated expression of miR-205 and the HHT phenotype.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

23805858	HHT diagnosis by Mid-infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural network analysis	The vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is in general an inherited disease caused by mutations in the TGF-β/BMP receptors endoglin or ALK1 or in rare cases by mutations of the TGF-β signal transducer protein Smad4 leading to the combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT. HHT is characterized by several clinical symptoms like spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases at sites like lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose, and visceral lesions like gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations. The disease shows an inter- and intra-family variability in penetrance as well as symptoms from mild to life threatening. Penetrance is also depending on age. Diagnosis of the disease is based on the presence of some of the listed symptoms or by genetic testing. HHT diagnosis is laborious, time consuming, costly and sometimes uncertain. Not all typical symptoms may be present, especially at a younger age, and genetic testing does not always identify the disease causing mutation. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was investigated as a potential alternative to the current diagnostic methods. IR-spectra were obtained by Fourier-transform Mid-IR spectroscopy from blood plasma from HHT patients and a healthy control group. Spectral data were mathematically processed and subsequently classified and analysed by artificial neural network (ANN) analyses and by visual analysis of scatter plots of the dominant principal components. The analyses showed that for HHT a disease specific IR-spectrum exists that is significantly different from the control group. Furthermore, at the current stage with the here used methods, HHT can be diagnosed by Mid-IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%. Visual analysis of PCA scatter plots revealed an inter class variation of the HHT group. IR-spectroscopy in combination with ANN analysis can be considered to be a serious alternative diagnostic method compared to clinical and genetically based methods. Blood plasma is an ideal candidate for diagnostic purposes, it is inexpensive, easy to isolate and only minimal amounts are required. In addition, IR-spectroscopy measurement times are fast, less than one minute, and diagnosis is not based on interpretation of may be uncertain clinical data. And last but not least, the method is inexpensive.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

23812912	West syndrome, microcephaly, grey matter heterotopia and hypoplasia of corpus callosum due to a novel ARFGEF2 mutation	West syndrome (WS) is an epileptic encephalopathy of childhood, defined by the presence of clustered spasms usually occurring before the age of 1 year, hypsarrhythmia on EEG that is notoriously difficult to define, and developmental arrest or regression. The incidence of WS is 1:3200 live births with an aetiology-dependent prognosis. Up to 80% of children with symptomatic WS suffer from mental retardation, and approximately 50% develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing, we identified a ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) guanine nucleotide-exchange factor two (brefeldin A-inhibited) (ARFGEF2) mutation in five related infants with WS. ARFGEF2 is involved in the activation of ARFs by accelerating replacement of bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) with Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and is involved in Golgi transport. A mutation in ARFGEF2 has been previously described only once, causing microcephaly and periventricular heterotopia. Here, we describe a novel ARFGEF2 mutation in five related patients presenting with WS, microcephaly, periventricular heterotopia and thin corpus callosum.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

Using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing, we identified a ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) guanine nucleotide-exchange factor two (brefeldin A-inhibited) (ARFGEF2) mutation in five related infants with WS. ARFGEF2 is involved in the activation of ARFs by accelerating replacement of bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) with Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and is involved in Golgi transport. A mutation in ARFGEF2 has been previously described only once, causing microcephaly and periventricular heterotopia. Here, we describe a novel ARFGEF2 mutation in five related patients presenting with WS, microcephaly, periventricular heterotopia and thin corpus callosum.
23815177	High expression of midkine in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis	Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in impaired host defense during cystic fibrosis (CF), where Pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes a key pathogen. We investigated the expression pattern of the antibacterial growth factor midkine (MK) in CF and the possible interference with its activity by the altered airway microenvironment. High MK expression was found in CF lung tissue compared with control samples, involving epithelia of the large and small airways, alveoli, and cells of the submucosa (i.e., neutrophils and mast cells). In CF sputum, MK was present at 100-fold higher levels, but was also subject to increased degradation, compared with MK in sputum from healthy control subjects. MK exerted a bactericidal effect on P. aeruginosa, but increasing salt concentrations and low pH impaired this activity. Molecular modeling suggested that the effects of salt and pH were attributable to electrostatic screening and a charge-neutralization of the membrane, respectively. Both the neutrophil elastase and elastase of P. aeruginosa cleaved MK to smaller fragments, resulting in impaired bactericidal activity. Thus, MK is highly expressed in CF, but its bactericidal properties may be impaired by the altered microenvironment, as reflected by the in vitro conditions used in this study.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23820266	γ-Glutamyltransferase catabolism of S-nitrosoglutathione modulates IL-8 expression in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells	S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous nitrosothiol involved in several pathophysiological processes. A role for GSNO has been envisaged in the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8; however, conflicting results have been reported. γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) enzyme activity can hydrolyze the γ-glutamyl bond present in the GSNO molecule thus greatly accelerating the release of bioactive nitric oxide. Expression of GGT is induced by oxidative stress, and activated neutrophils contribute to GGT increase in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung exudates by releasing GGT-containing microvesicles. This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of GSNO catabolism mediated by GGT on production of IL-8 in CF transmembrane regulation protein-mutated IB3-1 bronchial cells. The rapid, GGT-catalyzed catabolism of GSNO caused a decrease in both basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-8 production in IB3-1 cells, by modulating both NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways, along with a decrease in cell proliferation. In contrast, a slow decomposition of GSNO produced a significant increase in both cell proliferation and expression of IL-8, the latter possibly through p38-mediated stabilization of IL-8 mRNA. Our data suggest that the differential GSNO catabolism mediated by GGT enzyme activity can downregulate the production of IL-8 in CF cells. Hence, the role of GGT activity should be considered when evaluating GSNO for both in vitro and in vivo studies, the more so in the case of GSNO-based therapies for cystic fibrosis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

23827423	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptomatic to hypothalamic hamartoma: evolution and long-term outcome following surgery	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a catastrophic childhood cryptogenic or symptomatic epilepsy. Hypothalamic hamartomas cause refractory epilepsy often consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were defined by a triad of multiple generalized seizure types, slow spike-and-wave on EEG, and mental retardation. Twenty-one of 159 hypothalamic hamartoma patients (14%) met the diagnostic criteria of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The median age of patients at epilepsy onset was 0.9 years (range, birth to 9 years). Six of the 21 patients (28%) had preceding infantile spasms. **All patients underwent different surgical approaches, including endoscopic, transcallosal, orbitozygomatic resections, and radiosurgery treatment.** Five of the 21 (24%) were seizure free with an additional 9 (42%) having at least >90% seizure reduction. Only 1 patient was not effectively treated (<50% seizure reduction). Eighty-eight percent of parents reported improvement in behavioral functioning. **Shorter duration of epilepsy prior to surgery was a significant predictor of surgical outcome.** Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptomatic to hypothalamic hamartomas have better postsurgical outcome due to other etiologies compared with cryptogenic and symptomatic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients. However, compared with overall hypothalamic hamartomas postsurgical outcomes, this cohort was less favorable. Earlier surgery may lead to better outcomes.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

23850002	Outcomes of epilepsy surgery in childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy	to evaluate the outcomes and role of epilepsy surgery in children with intractable epileptic encephalopathy (EE). ninety-five children (64 boys, 31 girls) with intractable EE were treated by epilepsy surgery at Severance Children's Hospital from 2003 to 2008. Surgical treatments included lobar resection, hemispherotomy and corpus callosotomy (CC). Seventy-six children were Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and 19 had West syndrome. of the 76 patients with LGS, CC was performed in 37 patients (48.7%), lobar resection in 29 (38.2%) and hemispherotomy in 10 (13.2%). Of the 19 patients with West syndrome, respective surgery was performed in 15 patients (78.9%) and CC in 4 (21.1%). Of the patients receiving respective surgery, Engel's class I outcomes were achieved for 24 of 39 (61.5%) of LGS patients, and for 9 of 15 (60.0%) of West syndrome. Malformations of cortical development were commonly observed, appearing in 73.5% (36/49). In neuropsychiatric tests, 19 of 27 with LGS demonstrated improvement in postoperative cognitive function. More significant intellectual improvement correlated well with shorter epilepsy duration, good seizure outcomes, and decreased number of antiepileptic drugs. epilepsy surgery should be considered in treating childhood intractable EE with expectation of improvement of both seizure and cognitive outcomes, even in cases of LGS.

23927801	Prospective multicenter study on long-term ketogenic diet therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term ketogenic diet (KD) on the children with intractable epilepsy. This was a prospective, open-label study of intractable epilepsy patients treated with the classic KD with a lipid-to-nonlipid ratio 4:1 between October 2004 and July 2011 at five Chinese epilepsy centers. A total of 299 patients were enrolled. The patients were divided into different groups according to age (including the below-1-year-old group, 1-to-3-year-old group, 3-to-6-year-old group, 6-to-10-year-old group, and over-10-year-old group), etiology (cryptogenic epilepsy, symptomatic epilepsy, and idiopathic epilepsy), and the seizure types (included infantile spasm, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome, generalized epilepsy, and partial epilepsy). Parents were assigned to write seizure diaries which recorded the seizure presentations, tolerability, and complications associated with the KD. Patients' weight and height were measured every week. Blood β-hydroxybutyric acid, blood sugar, and urinary ketone bodies were monitored closely. Patients were followed up through telephone calls by the nutritionists every month and regular outpatient visits or hospitalizations were recommended at all time-points which included the third, sixth and twelfth month after initiation. Efficacy was measured through seizure frequency. The variables related to the efficacy were also analyzed. SPSS 17.0 was used for all statistical analysis. At 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation, 65.9%, 44.8%, and 26.4% patients remained on the diet, and 37.4%, 26.1%, and 20.4% had a > 50% reduction in their seizure frequency, including 21.7%, 10.7%, and 11.0% who became seizure free, respectively. At 24 months after initiation, 29 patients remained on the diet, and 28 patients had a > 90% seizure reduction, including five became seizure free. At 36 months after initiation, 7 patients remained on the diet, and all of them had a > 90% seizure reduction, including five became seizure free. No significant variables were related to the efficacy. Most complications were mild and reversible by conservative treatment. Gastrointestinal disturbances were the main complications, which included vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal cramp. Severe complications occurred in four cases, including severe metabolic disturbances and severe pneumonia. The KD is a safe and effective alternative therapy for intractable childhood epilepsy.

23934111	De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies	Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

23973644	Cost-effectiveness analysis of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	An economic model evaluated the costs and outcomes of adjunctive clobazam therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) compared with adjunctive lamotrigine, rufinamide, and topiramate. Clinical data were used to estimate baseline frequency and the percentage of drop-seizure reductions over 3 months (all comparators) and 2 years (rufinamide). Claims data from a large US health care plan were employed to estimate costs. After 3 months, 21.5% of those receiving clobazam were drop-seizure-free. Over a 3-month horizon, clobazam was more effective and less expensive than comparators, with the assumption that >0.77% of drop seizures required medical care. Below this threshold, topiramate was less costly than clobazam. With the base-case assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures were medically attended, costs for patients receiving clobazam totaled $30,147 versus $34,223-$35,378 for comparators. Clobazam was more efficacious and less costly than rufinamide over a 2-year horizon. The percentage of medically attended drop seizures was a driver of results. Clobazam treatment may be cost-saving.

23981349	Compound heterozygosity in GPR56 with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria	Polymicrogyria is caused by a diverse etiology, one of which is gene mutation. At present, only one gene (GPR56) is known to cause polymicrogyria, which leads to a distinctive phenotype termed bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is an autosomal recessive inherited human brain malformation with abnormal cortical lamination. Here, we identified compound heterozygous GPR56 mutations in a patient with BFPP. The proband was a Japanese female born from non-consanguineous parents. She presented with mental retardation, developmental motor delay, epilepsy exhibiting the feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, exotropia, bilateral polymicrogyria with a relatively spared perisylvian region, bilateral patchy-white-matter MRI signal changes, and hypoplastic pontine basis. GPR56 sequence analysis revealed a c.107G>A substitution leading to a p.S36N, and a c.113G>A leading to a p.R38Q. Although affected individuals with compound heterozygosity in GPR56 have not been previously described, we presume that compound heterozygosity of these two mutations in a ligand binding domain within the extracellular N-terminus of protein could result in BFPP. In addition, we observed unusually less involvement of perisylvian cortex for polymicrogyria, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for epilepsy, which are likely common features in patients with BFPP caused by GPR56 mutations.

24012506	Corpus callosotomy is a valuable therapeutic option for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and medically refractory seizures	We present our experience with corpus callosotomy (CC) in a developing country with limited resources in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and medically refractory seizures. All patients with LGS who underwent CC for medically refractory epilepsy at Namazee Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran from May 2009 through March 2012 were reviewed in a retrospective study. Presurgical evaluation included clinical history, neurological examination, a 2-hour video-EEG recording, and 1.5-T MRI. Outcome was evaluated at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. We considered the outcome as a success if the patients were either seizure-free or had more than 85% reduction in seizure frequency compared to their preoperative status. Eighteen patients (14 males and 4 females) had surgery. Overall, seizures in 11 patients (61.1%) responded favorably one year after surgery; this figure was 6 out of 9 patients (66.6%) two years after surgery. Seven patients (38.8%) were free of disabling seizures one year after CC; this figure was three out of nine patients (33.3%) two years after CC. Three patients (16.6%) were free of all seizure types one year after surgery. Ten patients (55.5%) had no postoperative complications of any kind. Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative surgical procedure for patients with LGS with intractable seizures whose seizures are not amenable to focal resection. This is a feasible treatment option for patients, even for those in developing countries with limited resources.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24045845	Autosomal recessive mutations in nuclear transport factor KPNA7 are associated with infantile spasms and cerebellar malformation	Nuclear import receptors of the KPNA family recognize the nuclear localization signal in proteins and together with importin-β mediate translocation into the nucleus. Accordingly, KPNA family members have a highly conserved architecture with domains that contact the nuclear localization signal and bind to importin-β. Here, we describe autosomal recessive mutations in KPNA7 found by whole exome sequencing in a sibling pair with severe developmental disability, infantile spasms, subsequent intractable epilepsy consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The mutations mapped to exon 7 in KPNA7 result in two amino-acid substitutions, Pro339Ala and Glu344Gln. On the basis of the crystal structure of the paralog KPNA2 bound to a bipartite nuclear localization signal from the retinoblastoma protein, the amino-acid substitutions in the affected subjects were predicted to occur within the seventh armadillo repeat that forms one of the two nuclear localization signal-binding sites in KPNA family members. Glu344 is conserved in all seven KPNA proteins, and we found that the Glu354Gln mutation in KPNA2 is sufficient to reduce binding to the retinoblastoma nuclear localization signal to approximately one-half that of wild-type protein. Our data show that compound heterozygous mutations in KPNA7 are associated with a human neurodevelopmental disease, and provide the first example of a human disease associated with mutation of a nuclear transport receptor.

Accordingly, KPNA family members have a highly conserved architecture with domains that contact the nuclear localization signal and bind to importin-β. Here, we describe autosomal recessive mutations in KPNA7 found by whole exome sequencing in a sibling pair with severe developmental disability, infantile spasms, subsequent intractable epilepsy consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The mutations mapped to exon 7 in KPNA7 result in two amino-acid substitutions, Pro339Ala and Glu344Gln. On the basis of the crystal structure of the paralog KPNA2 bound to a bipartite nuclear localization signal from the retinoblastoma protein, the amino-acid substitutions in the affected subjects were predicted to occur within the seventh armadillo repeat that forms one of the two nuclear localization signal-binding sites in KPNA family members. Glu344 is conserved in all seven KPNA proteins, and we found that the Glu354Gln mutation in KPNA2 is sufficient to reduce binding to the retinoblastoma nuclear localization signal to approximately one-half that of wild-type protein. Our data show that compound heterozygous mutations in KPNA7 are associated with a human neurodevelopmental disease, and provide the first example of a human disease associated with mutation of a nuclear transport receptor.
24098321	A genome-wide investigation of copy number variation in patients with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformation	Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels, with shunting of blood from the arterial to venous circulation and a high risk of rupture and intracranial hemorrhage. Most BAVMs are sporadic, but also occur in patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Mendelian disorder caused by mutations in genes in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway. To investigate whether copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to risk of sporadic BAVM, we performed a genome-wide association study in 371 sporadic BAVM cases and 563 healthy controls, all Caucasian. Cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array. CNVs were called using the PennCNV and Birdsuite algorithms and analyzed via segment-based and gene-based approaches. Common and rare CNVs were evaluated for association with BAVM. A CNV region on 1p36.13, containing the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, member 1 gene (NBPF1), was significantly enriched with duplications in BAVM cases compared to controls (P = 2.2×10(-9)); NBPF1 was also significantly associated with BAVM in gene-based analysis using both PennCNV and Birdsuite. We experimentally validated the 1p36.13 duplication; however, the association did not replicate in an independent cohort of 184 sporadic BAVM cases and 182 controls (OR = 0.81, P = 0.8). Rare CNV analysis did not identify genes significantly associated with BAVM. We did not identify common CNVs associated with sporadic BAVM that replicated in an independent cohort. Replication in larger cohorts is required to elucidate the possible role of common or rare CNVs in BAVM pathogenesis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

24105702	Whole-exome sequencing identifies a variant of the mitochondrial MT-ND1 gene associated with epileptic encephalopathy: west syndrome evolving to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	We describe a West syndrome (WS) patient with unidentified etiology that evolved to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The mitochondrial respiratory chain of the patient showed a simple complex I deficiency in fibroblasts. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) uncovered two heterozygous mutations in NDUFV2 gene that were reassigned to a pseudogene. With the WES data, it was possible to obtain whole mitochondrial DNA sequencing and to identify a heteroplasmic variant in the MT-ND1 (MTND1) gene (m.3946G>A, p.E214K). The expression of the gene in patient fibroblasts was not affected but the protein level was significantly reduced, suggesting that protein stability was affected by this mutation. The lower protein level also affected assembly of complex I and supercomplexes (I/III2 /IV and I/III2 ), leading to complex I deficiency. While ATP levels at steady state under stress conditions were not affected, the amount of ROS produced by complex I was significantly increased.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

24113539	Efficacy of verapamil as an adjunctive treatment in children with drug-resistant epilepsy: a pilot study	Verapamil, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, has been occasionally reported to have some effect on reducing seizure frequency in drug-resistant epilepsy or status epilepticus. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of verapamil as add-on treatment in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Seven children with drug-resistant structural-metabolic, unknown or genetic (e.g., Dravet syndrome [DS]) epilepsy received verapamil as an add-on drug to baseline antiepileptic therapy. Verapamil was slowly introduced at the dosage of 1mg/kg/day and titrated up to 1.5mg/kg/day. After completing the titration period, patients entered a 14-month maintenance period and were followed up at 3, 8, and 14 months. Heart monitoring was performed at baseline and at each follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the response of seizures to verapamil. Three subjects with genetically determined DS showed a partial (reduction of 50-99%) response for all types of seizures. A patient with DS without known mutation showed a partial control of all types of seizures in the first 13 months; then seizures worsened and verapamil was suspended. Two patients with structural epilepsy and one with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome showed no improvement. Any side effects were recorded. Add-on treatment with verapamil seems to have some effect in controlling seizures in patients with genetically determined DS. Our observations justify further research on the relationship between calcium channels, calcium channel blockers, and channelopathies.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

The cause is unknown in 25% of cases. Little has been described about the specific clinical or electroencephalography (EEG) features of LGS of unknown or genetic cause (LGS(u)). The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP) aims to characterize LGS(u) by phenotypic analysis of patients with LGS(u) and their parents. One hundred thirty-five patients with LGS with no known etiology and their parents were enrolled from 19 EPGP centers in the United States and Australia. Clinical data from medical records, standardized questionnaires, imaging, and EEG were collected with use of online informatics systems developed for EPGP. LGS(u) in the EPGP cohort had a broad range of onset of epilepsy from 1 to 13 years, was male predominant (p < 0.0002), and was associated with normal development prior to seizure onset in 59.2% of patients. Despite the diagnosis, almost half of the adult patients with LGS(u) completed secondary school. Parents were cognitively normal. All subjects had EEG recordings with generalized epileptiform abnormalities with a spike wave frequency range of 1-5 Hz (median 2 Hz), whereas 8.1% of subjects had EEG studies with a normal posterior dominant rhythm. Almost 12% of patients evolved from West syndrome. LGS(u) has distinctive characteristics including a broad age range of onset, male predominance, and often normal development prior to the onset of seizures. Cognitive achievements such as completion of secondary school were possible in half of adult patients. Our phenotypic description of LGS(u) coupled with future genetic studies will advance our understanding of this epilepsy syndrome.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

24122274	Ictal electroencephalography and electromyography features in symptomatic infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms	Recently, epilepsy with late-onset epileptic spasms (ES) has been reported to be distinct from West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We identified the characteristics of this clinical entity by analyzing clinical data, including ictal electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in symptomatic patients. We evaluated retrospectively eight symptomatic patients with epilepsy with late-onset ES. All patients underwent video-EEG analysis for more than 24 hours and have been followed up for at least 1 year. Interictal EEG, ictal EEG, ictal EMG, coexistence seizures, response to treatment, and intellectual or daily activity level were assessed. Ictal EMG was evaluated by spectral analysis. All patients exhibited neurological deterioration and had multiple seizure types; seven of them had intractable seizures. Interictal EEG showed no typical hypsarrhythmia in any case. Ictal EMG analysis revealed that the predominant seizure types presenting with the tonic component were distributed among ES, spasms followed by tonic seizures (SFT), and tonic seizures. The clinical characteristics of our patients were identical to infantile epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset spasms. Our patients had ES, SFT, and tonic seizures as the core seizure types, developed ES beyond the age of 1 year, and showed neurological deterioration. These may be essential symptoms of this clinical entity.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

24237632	Report of a parent survey of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis use in pediatric treatment-resistant epilepsy	Severe childhood epilepsies are characterized by frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delays, and impaired quality of life. In these treatment-resistant epilepsies, families often seek alternative treatments. This survey explored the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis in children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. The survey was presented to parents belonging to a Facebook group dedicated to sharing information about the use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis to treat their child's seizures. **Nineteen responses met the following inclusion criteria for the study: a diagnosis of epilepsy and current use of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. **Thirteen children had Dravet syndrome, four had Doose syndrome, and one each had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and idiopathic epilepsy. The average number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) tried before using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis was 12. Sixteen (84%) of the 19 parents reported a reduction in their child's seizure frequency while taking cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. Of these, two (11%) reported complete seizure freedom, eight (42%) reported a greater than 80% reduction in seizure frequency, and six (32%) reported a 25-60% seizure reduction. Other beneficial effects included increased alertness, better mood, and improved sleep. Side effects included drowsiness and fatigue.** Our survey shows that parents are using cannabidiol-enriched cannabis as a treatment for their children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. **Because of the increasing number of states that allow access to medical cannabis, its use will likely be a growing concern for the epilepsy community. Safety and tolerability data for cannabidiol-enriched cannabis use among children are not available.

24267784	Copy number variations in endoglin locus: mapping of large deletions in Spanish families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1	"The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT), also known as the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a multiorganic vascular disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Diagnostic clinical criteria include: epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance. HHT is transmitted in 90% of the cases as an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in either endoglin (ENG), or activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) genes (HHT type 1 and 2, respectively). We have carried out a genetic analysis of four independent Spanish families with HHT clinical criteria, which has permitted the identification of new large deletions in ENG. These mutations were first detected using the MLPA technique and subsequently, the deletion breakpoints were mapped using a customized copy number variation (CNV) microarray. The array was designed to cover the ENG gene and surrounding areas. All tested families carried large deletions ranging from 3-kb to 100-kb, involving the ENG gene promoter, several ENG exons, and the two downstream genes FGSH and CDK9. Interestingly, common breakpoints coincident with Alu repetitive sequences were found among these families. The systematic hybridization of DNA from HHT families, with deletions or duplications, to custom designed microarrays, could allow the mapping of breakpoints, coincident with repetitive Alu sequences that might act as ""hot spots"" in the development of chromosomal anomalies."	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

24273414	Woman presenting with chronic iron deficiency anemia associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with frequent nose bleeds that can be troublesome and difficult to contain. A further manifestation is telangiectasia, which may develop in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The associated blood loss can be chronic, resulting in iron deficiency anemia which, when severe, has historically been treated by blood transfusions. Further pulmonary, neurologic, and hepatic complications may appear in later life, and are well documented. Administering blood transfusions requires provision, storage, and serological testing to select suitable units. Recognition of the inherent potential risks of donated blood, the expense, and the concerns regarding blood supply, has resulted in a national policy for conservation and appropriate use of blood. For an individual patient, there may be development of alloantibodies which complicates future cross-matching for transfusions. **SG is a 66-year-old Caucasian woman who first presented to our hematology department in 2003, having just moved to the area. She had suffered with nose bleeds since her teenage years and presented with a low hemoglobin level and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.** Medical and nonmedical interventions failed to arrest the blood loss, which had not been massive or associated with hypovolemic shock. Pursuant to conserving blood supplies, and based on experience of patients with other causes of iron deficiency anemia, **a regimen of high-dose iron supplementation was adopted.** The aim was to sustain iron stores as a substrate for erythropoiesis and thereby achieve adequate hemoglobin levels whilst minimizing the need for blood transfusion. **This approach has maintained the patient's hemoglobin levels at 6.4-11.6 g/dL over a period of 9 years.** Until the time of writing in 2011, the maximum number of blood transfusions she has received in a year has been six, albeit there has been a steady slow increase since 2006. Her quality of life has been good throughout, with good levels of activity, a normal lifestyle, and no pain. The high-dose iron regimen is estimated to have avoided administration of up to 90 units of blood in 2011, at a saving to the National Health Service of at least £7000.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

She was found to have atypical atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Radiofrequency ablation was planned, but inferior vena cava interruption precluded right atrial (RA) access. The RA was then accessed through both subclavian veins, and activation mapping revealed a dense atriotomy scar in the posterolateral inferior RA. Wavefront propagation proceeded caudally through an area of slow conduction confined by the atriotomy scar. Atypical atrial flutter terminated during a second radiofrequency application to an isthmus confined by 2 regions of dense scar. The arrhythmia did not recur, although the patient later experienced typical atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. High-output heart failure due to systemic arteriovenous shunt was confirmed by cardiac catheterization and improved markedly with bevacizumab therapy.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

24349537	Integrin α6β4 identifies human distal lung epithelial progenitor cells with potential as a cell-based therapy for cystic fibrosis lung disease	To develop stem/progenitor cell-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, it is first necessary to identify markers of human lung epithelial progenitor/stem cells and to better understand the potential for differentiation into distinct lineages. Here we investigated integrin α6β4 as an epithelial progenitor cell marker in the human distal lung. We identified a subpopulation of α6β4(+) cells that localized in distal small airways and alveolar walls and were devoid of pro-surfactant protein C expression. The α6β4(+) epithelial cells demonstrated key properties of stem cells ex vivo as compared to α6β4(-) epithelial cells, including higher colony forming efficiency, expression of stem cell-specific transcription factor Nanog, and the potential to differentiate into multiple distinct lineages including basal and Clara cells. Co-culture of α6β4(+) epithelial cells with endothelial cells enhanced proliferation. We identified a subset of adeno-associated virus (AAVs) serotypes, AAV2 and AAV8, capable of transducing α6β4(+) cells. In addition, reconstitution of bronchi epithelial cells from CF patients with only 5% normal α6β4(+) epithelial cells significantly rescued defects in Cl(-) transport. Therefore, targeting the α6β4(+) epithelial population via either gene delivery or progenitor cell-based reconstitution represents a potential new strategy to treat CF lung disease.	cystic fibrosis	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		243	Integrin α6β4 identifies human distal lung epithelial progenitor cells with potential as a cell-based therapy for cystic fibrosis lung disease. To develop stem/progenitor cell-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, it is first necessary to identify markers of human lung epithelial progenitor/stem cells and to better understand the potential for differentiation into distinct lineages. Here we investigated integrin α6β4 as an epithelial progenitor cell marker in the human distal lung.

24400693	First clinical experiences with perampanel--the Kork experience in 74 patients	Perampanel (PER) has been approved for adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients age 12 years and older. In Germany, PER was licensed and marketed in September of 2012. At our tertiary referral epilepsy center, a couple of difficult-to-treat patients were awaiting this introduction of PER; therefore, we were able to initiate treatment in many patients within a short period of time. For this report we collected and analyzed the data of the first patients who had been started on add-on PER between September and December of 2012, so that we were able to evaluate at least 6 months of treatment when we made this analysis. At cutoff in June of 2013, 74 patients could be analyzed. Mean age was 38.4 years (range 15-71 years). PER doses ranged from 4 to 14 mg (mean 8.8 mg). All patients took PER once daily at bedtime. Seventy-one patients had focal epileptic seizures; the remaining four patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Considering the last 3 months of observation compared with baseline, 34 patients (46%) were responders with a reduction of seizure frequency of at least 50%. Ten patients of these (14% of all) were seizure-free. Adverse events were reported in 40 patients (54%). Leading side effects were somnolence (n = 31, 42%) and dizziness (n = 13, 18%), followed by ataxia, irritability, falls, cognitive slowing, and depression in single cases. Six-month retention rate was 70%. Our first clinical experiences with add-on PER in a highly selected group of difficult-to-treat epilepsies are promising.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24431198	Outpatient endoscopic sinus surgery in cystic fibrosis patients: predictive factors for admission	An increasing number of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are becoming candidates for elective endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We sought to identify perioperative factors in this patient population that were predictive of postoperative admission. Retrospective chart review of CF patients who underwent ESS during the years 2005 through 2012. Multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative variables were analyzed. Thirty-three patients who underwent 37 outpatient ESSs were identified. Successful same-day discharge was observed in 54%. In 46% of cases, postoperative admission was necessary, with a mean postoperative stay of 1.4 days. Pulmonary function, CF-related comorbidities, and history of lung transplant were not predictors of postoperative admission. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients were more likely to be admitted if they had 1 of the following conditions: history of ≥4 prior ESS; procedure duration >2.5 hours; intraoperative blood loss greater than 150 mL; increased immediate postoperative pain scores; or larger narcotic requirements for pain control. On logistic regression analysis, a maximum pain score ≥ 7 out of 10 in the postanesthesia recovery unit was the only significant predisposing factor for postoperative admission. Although over 50% of adult CF patients can successfully undergo ESS on a same-day discharge basis, it is prudent to have contingent plans for potential inpatient observation postoperatively. Multivariate analysis suggests that preoperative demographics and pulmonary status cannot predict the need for postoperative admission, whereas higher pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit are predictive of the necessity for inpatient observation.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

24489709	ENDOGLIN is dispensable for vasculogenesis, but required for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis	ENDOGLIN (ENG) is a co-receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members that is highly expressed in endothelial cells and has a critical function in the development of the vascular system. Mutations in Eng are associated with the vascular disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type l. Using mouse embryonic stem cells we observed that angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), induce vasculogenesis in embryoid bodies even when Eng deficient cells or cells depleted of Eng using shRNA are used. However, ENG is required for the stem cell-derived endothelial cells to organize effectively into tubular structures. Consistent with this finding, fetal metatarsals isolated from E17.5 Eng heterozygous mouse embryos showed reduced VEGF-induced vascular network formation. Moreover, shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ENG in human umbilical vein cells mitigated VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that ENG is required for efficient VEGF-induced angiogenesis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

24499751	Outcomes of pregnancy in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	To describe pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This was a retrospective descriptive study of women with HHT (18-55 years of age) from the Toronto HHT Database using a telephone questionnaire regarding pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. A total of 244 pregnancies were reported in 87 women with HHT. Miscarriages occurred in 20%. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related complications included minor hemoptysis during two pregnancies (1.1%) and hemothorax during four pregnancies (2.1%). One patient presenting with a hemothorax had presented during a previous pregnancy with a transient ischemic attack, most likely resulting from paradoxical emboli. One patient presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, and one patient presented with heart failure. These complications occurred in women previously unscreened and untreated for arteriovenous malformations. Other complications not clearly related to HHT were deep vein thrombosis (n=1), pulmonary embolism (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and myocardial ischemia (n=1). Women noticed an increased frequency of epistaxis and development of new telangiectases during pregnancy. Epidural or spinal anesthesia was performed in 92 of 185 deliveries (50%) without complications. None of these women had undergone screening for spinal arteriovenous malformation before anesthesia. Women with HHT who have not been screened for arteriovenous malformations are at risk for serious pregnancy complications.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

24520391	Novel brain arteriovenous malformation mouse models for type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Endoglin (ENG) is a causative gene of type 1 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). HHT1 patients have a higher prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) than the general population and patients with other HHT subtypes. The pathogenesis of brain AVM in HHT1 patients is currently unknown and no specific medical therapy is available to treat patients. Proper animal models are crucial for identifying the underlying mechanisms for brain AVM development and for testing new therapies. However, creating HHT1 brain AVM models has been quite challenging because of difficulties related to deleting Eng-floxed sequence in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice. To create an HHT1 brain AVM mouse model, we used several Cre transgenic mouse lines to delete Eng in different cell-types in Eng(2fl/2fl) mice: R26CreER (all cell types after tamoxifen treatment), SM22α-Cre (smooth muscle and endothelial cell) and LysM-Cre (lysozyme M-positive macrophage). An adeno-associated viral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (AAV-VEGF) was injected into the brain to induce focal angiogenesis. We found that SM22α-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo caused AVMs in the postnatal brain, spinal cord, and intestines. Induction of Eng deletion in adult mice using R26CreER plus local VEGF stimulation induced the brain AVM phenotype. In both models, Eng-null endothelial cells were detected in the brain AVM lesions, and formed mosaicism with wildtype endothelial cells. However, LysM-Cre-mediated Eng deletion in the embryo did not cause AVM in the postnatal brain even after VEGF stimulation. In this study, we report two novel HHT1 brain AVM models that mimic many phenotypes of human brain AVM and can thus be used for studying brain AVM pathogenesis and testing new therapies. Further, our data indicate that macrophage Eng deletion is insufficient and that endothelial Eng homozygous deletion is required for HHT1 brain AVM development.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

24522087	Agreement of bioelectric impedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for body composition evaluation in adults with cystic fibrosis	Malnutrition in cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with increased mortality and can lead to fat-free (FFM) and fat mass (FM) loss. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is used and validated to measure FFM and FM. DXA's high cost has led to the utilization of less costly techniques such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The aim of this study was to determine the agreement of FFM, FM and %FM measurements taken with DXA and BIA in adults with CF. We measured FFM, FM and %FM in 34 adults with CF with a leg-to-leg BIA and an iDXA and determined agreement using Bland-Altman analysis. While DXA and BIA measurements were well correlated (r > 0.8), mean biases between both methods were between 8 and 11%. BIA underestimated FM and %FM and overestimated FFM. In a clinical research setting where these measurements are used to phenotype patients, BIA cannot replace DXA.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

24533090	Clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam display significantly greater affinities for α₂- versus α₁-GABA(A)-receptor complexes	Clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZD), was FDA-approved in October 2011 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years and older. BZDs exert various CNS effects through allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. The structurally distinct, 1,4-BZD clonazepam (CLN) is also approved to treat LGS. The precise mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of both are unknown. Data show that the GABAA α₁-subunit-selective compound zolpidem [ZOL] exhibits hypnotic/sedative effects. Conversely, data from knock-in mice carrying BZD binding site mutations suggest that the α₂ subunit mediates anticonvulsant effects, without sedative actions. Hence, the specific pattern of interactions across the GABAA receptor complexes of BZDs might be reflected in their clinical efficacies and adverse effect profiles. In this study, GABAA-receptor binding affinities of CLB, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB, the major metabolite of CLB), CLN, and ZOL were characterized with native receptors from rat-brain homogenates and on cloned receptors from HEK293 cells transfected with combinations of α (α₁, α₂, α₃, or α₅), β₂, and γ₂ subtypes. Our results demonstrate that CLB and N-CLB have significantly greater binding affinities for α₂- vs. α₁-receptor complexes, a difference not observed for CLN, for which no distinction between α₂ and α₁ receptors was observed. Our experiments with ZOL confirmed the high preference for α₁ receptors. These results provide potential clues to a new understanding of the pharmacologic modes of action of CLB and N-CLB.

24553310	Combined use of multiple computational intracranial EEG analysis techniques for the localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Traditionally, identification of epileptogenic zones primarily relied on visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings by experienced epileptologists; however, removal of epileptogenic zones identified by iEEG does not always guarantee favorable surgical outcomes. To confirm visual inspection results, and assist in making decisions about surgical resection areas, computational iEEG analysis methods have recently been used for the localization of epileptogenic zones. In this study, we have proposed a new approach for the localization of epileptogenic zones in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), and have investigated whether the proposed approach could confirm surgical resection areas and predict seizure outcome before surgery. The proposed approach simultaneously used results of 2 iEEG analysis methods, directed transfer function (DTF) and time delay estimation, to enhance localization accuracy. This new combined method was applied to patients who became seizure-free after resective epilepsy surgery, as well as those who had unsuccessful surgery. A quantitative metric was also introduced that can measure how well the localized epileptogenic zones coincided with the surgical resection areas, with the aim of verifying whether the approach could confirm surgical resection areas determined by epileptologists. The estimated epileptogenic zones more strongly coincided with surgical resection areas in patients with successful, compared to those with unsuccessful surgical outcomes. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that the combined use of 2 iEEG analyses resulted in a more accurate estimate of epileptogenic zones in LGS than the use of a single method. A combination of multiple iEEG analyses could not only enhance overall accuracy of localizing epileptogenic zones in LGS, but also has the potential to predict outcomes before resective surgery.

24576297	Airway, but not serum or urinary, levels of YKL-40 reflect inflammation in early cystic fibrosis lung disease	Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease begins in early life and is progressive with the major risk factor being an exaggerated inflammatory response. Currently, assessment of neutrophilic inflammation in early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease relies on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is raised in sputum and serum of adults with CF. We investigated YKL-40 in BAL, serum and urine to determine whether this reflected inflammation and infection in young children with CF. YKL-40 was measured in matched samples of BAL, serum and urine obtained from 36 infants and young children with CF participating in an early surveillance program. Levels were compared to clinical data and markers of inflammation detected in the lung. YKL-40 in BAL correlated with pulmonary infection [β=1.30 (SE 0.34), p < 0.001] and BAL markers of inflammation [macrophage number: r2 = 0.34, p < 0.001; neutrophil number: r2 = 0.74, p < 0.001; neutrophil elastase: r2 = 0.47, p < 0.001; CXCL8: r2 = 0.45, p < 0.001; IL-β: r2 = 0.62, p < 0.001]. YKL-40 was detectable in serum but levels did not correlate with BAL levels in the same individuals (r2 = 0.04, p = 0.14) or with inflammatory markers. YKL-40 was below the limit of detection in urine (30 pg/ml). This study demonstrates that levels of the chitinase-like protein YKL-40 reflect airway inflammation and infection in early CF lung disease. The lack of increased YKL-40 in serum in the absence of systemic inflammation limits the benefit of this potential biomarker in early disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

24580023	Stable dosages of clobazam for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are associated with sustained drop-seizure and total-seizure improvements over 3 years	"To determine long-term safety and efficacy of adjunctive clobazam for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Eligible patients from two randomized controlled trials (Phase II OV-1002 and Phase III OV-1012) were able to enroll in open-label extension (OLE) study OV-1004 beginning in December 2005 and received clobazam until they discontinued (mandatory at 2 years for patients outside the United States) or until study completion in March 2012. Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6 years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting. Of 267 patients who enrolled in the OLE, 188 (70%) completed the trial. Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for >2 years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5 years, and 11 for 6 years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a ≥50% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure-free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure-free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were ""very much improved"" or ""much improved"" after 3 years. Of the 43 patients with concomitant AED data who were treated for 5 years, 30% increased, 19% decreased, and 51% had no change in numbers of AEDs versus their Week 4 regimens. The mean modal clobazam dosage was 0.90 mg/kg/day at Year 1 and 0.97 mg/kg/day at Year 5, suggesting that study patients did not need significant increases in dosage over time. The safety profile was what would be expected for clobazam for LGS patients over a 5-year span, and no new safety concerns developed over time.

24591578	Revertant mutants modify, but do not rescue, the gating defect of the cystic fibrosis mutant G551D-CFTR	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by dysfunction of the epithelial anion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One strategy to restore function to CF mutants is to suppress defects in CFTR processing and function using revertant mutations. Here, we investigate the effects of the revertant mutations G550E and 4RK (the simultaneous disruption of four arginine-framed tripeptides (AFTs): R29K, R516K, R555K and R766K) on the CF mutant G551D, which impairs severely channel gating without altering protein processing and which affects a residue in the same α-helix as G550 and R555. Both G550E and 4RK augmented strongly CFTR-mediated iodide efflux from BHK cells expressing G551D-CFTR. To learn how revertant mutations influence G551D-CFTR function, we studied protein processing and single-channel behaviour. Neither G550E nor 4RK altered the expression and maturation of G551D-CFTR protein. By contrast, both revertants had marked effects on G551D-CFTR channel gating, increasing strongly opening frequency, while 4RK also diminished noticeably the duration of channel openings. Because G551D-CFTR channel gating is ATP independent, we investigated whether revertant mutations restore ATP dependence to G551D-CFTR. Like wild-type CFTR, the activity of 4RK-G551D-CFTR varied with ATP concentration, suggesting that 4RK confers some ATP dependence on the G551D-CFTR channel. Thus, the revertant mutations G550E and 4RK alter the gating pattern and ATP dependence of G551D-CFTR without restoring single-channel activity to wild-type levels. Based on their impact on the CF mutants F508del and G551D, we conclude that G550E and 4RK have direct effects on CFTR structure, but that their action on CFTR processing and channel function is CF mutation specific.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24608547	Accelerating the rate of improvement in cystic fibrosis care: contributions and insights of the learning and leadership collaborative	The Learning and Leadership Collaborative (LLC) supports cystic fibrosis (CF) centres' responses to the variation in CF outcomes in the USA. Between 2002 and 2013, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) designed, tested and modified the LLC to guide front line staff efforts in these efforts. This paper describes the CFF LLC evolution and essential elements that have facilitated increased improvement capability of CF centres and improved CF outcomes. CF centre improvement teams across the USA have participated in 11 LLCs of 12 months' duration since 2002. Based on the Dartmouth Microsystem Improvement Curriculum, the original LLC included face to face meetings, an email listserv, conference calls and completion of between learning session task books. The LLCs evolved over time to include internet based learning, an electronic repository of improvement resources and examples, change ideas driven by evidence based clinical practice guidelines, benchmarking site visits, an applied QI measurement curriculum and team coaching. Over 90% of the CF centres in the USA have participated in the LLCs and have increased their improvement capabilities. Ten essential elements were identified as contributors to the successful LLCs: LLC national leadership and coordination, local leadership, people with CF and families involvement, registry data transparency, standardised improvement curriculum with evidence based change ideas, internet resources with reminders, team coaching, regular progress reporting and tracking, benchmarking site visits and applied improvement measurement. The LLCs have contributed to improved medical and process outcomes over the past 10 years. Ten essential elements of the LLCs may benefit improvement efforts in other chronic care populations and health systems.	cystic fibrosis			315	Accelerating the rate of improvement in cystic fibrosis care: contributions and insights of the learning and leadership collaborative.

24608905	Characterization of defects in ion transport and tissue development in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-knockout rats	Animal models for cystic fibrosis (CF) have contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Here we describe development and characterization of the first cystic fibrosis rat, in which the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) was knocked out using a pair of zinc finger endonucleases (ZFN). The disrupted Cftr gene carries a 16 base pair deletion in exon 3, resulting in loss of CFTR protein expression. Breeding of heterozygous (CFTR+/-) rats resulted in Mendelian distribution of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous (CFTR-/-) pups. Nasal potential difference and transepithelial short circuit current measurements established a robust CF bioelectric phenotype, similar in many respects to that seen in CF patients. Young CFTR-/- rats exhibited histological abnormalities in the ileum and increased intracellular mucus in the proximal nasal septa. By six weeks of age, CFTR-/- males lacked the vas deferens bilaterally. Airway surface liquid and periciliary liquid depth were reduced, and submucosal gland size was abnormal in CFTR-/- animals. Use of ZFN based gene disruption successfully generated a CF animal model that recapitulates many aspects of human disease, and may be useful for modeling other CF genotypes, including CFTR processing defects, premature truncation alleles, and channel gating abnormalities.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24614520	CHD2 mutations in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy with a heterogeneous etiology. I**n this study, we aimed to explore the role of CHD2 in LGS, as CHD2 mutations have been described recently in various epileptic encephalopathies. **We have previously identified one patient with a large deletion affecting the CHD2 gene in a group of 22 patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. In the remaining 17 patients without known etiology, Sanger sequencing revealed a de novo 1-bp duplication in the CHD2 gene in another patient. This mutation leads to a frameshift and, consequently, a premature stop codon 49bp downstream of the mutation. The patient had prominent myoclonic seizures and photosensitivity, thus, sharing phenotypic features with previously reported patients with CHD2-related epilepsy. In our original material of 22 patients with LGS features, we have now found two (9%) with mutations in the CHD2 gene. Our findings suggest that CHD2 mutations are important in the etiological spectrum of LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		184	CHD2 mutations in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

A 6-year-old boy began having myoclonic seizures at the age of 8 months and was diagnosed with LGS when he was 27 months old. Various antiepileptic drugs and a ketogenic diet failed to control his multiple types of seizures. At the age of 36 months, he underwent corpus callosotomy and achieved an immediate, post-operative seizure free state. However, 3 months later, various seizures relapsed and were refractory to additional vagus nerve stimulation. Remaining callosal fibers in the splenium noted on post-operative diffusion tensor imaging made us to perform a second operation, total callosotomy. The patient finally achieved a seizure-free state with electroencephalography (EEG) normalization noted after the staged total callosotomy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24649460	The efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in intractable pediatric epilepsy	Rufinamide (RUF) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) and its efficacy has been proven in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, there is a lack of data regarding the efficacy in pediatric intractable epilepsies other than LGS. The purpose of the study was to explore the efficacy and tolerability of RUF in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS. This retrospective observation study was conducted in Samsung medical center from August 2010 to September 2011. Thirty seven patients (27 males, 10 females, aged between 1.8 and 18.4 years), with refractory epilepsies or LGS were treated with RUF as an adjunctive drug. Efficacy was represented by the response rate and retention rate over the study period. Tolerability was measured as the number of patients who showed adverse effects. The overall response rate was 21.6% during the 12 months of the study period with 5.4% of seizure-free patients. The retention rate was 54% and ineffectiveness was the most common reason for discontinuation of RUF. The most common adverse effects were insomnia and somnolence. RUF may be considered to be an efficacious and safe AED for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies as well as LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24649473	Epilepsy surgery in pediatric intractable epilepsy with destructive encephalopathy	The aim of the current study is to review the clinical features, surgery outcomes and parental satisfaction of children with destructive encephalopathy who underwent epilepsy surgery due to medically intractable seizures. 48 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery from October 2003 to August 2011 at Severance Children's Hospital have been reviewed. The survey was conducted for functional outcomes and parental satisfaction at least 1 year after the surgery. Epileptic encephalopathy including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms was more prevalent than symptomatic focal epilepsy. Hypoxic ischemic injury accounted for most of the underlying etiology of the destructive encephalpathy, followed by central nervous system infection and head trauma. 27 patients (56.3%) underwent resective surgery and 21 patients (43.7%) underwent palliative surgery. 16 patients (33.3%) achieved seizure free and 27 parents (87.5%) reported satisfaction with the outcome of their children's epilepsy surgery. In addition, 14 parents (77.8 %) whose children were not seizure free reported satisfaction with their children's improvement in cognitive and behavior issues. Epilepsy surgery in destructive encephalopathy was effective for controlling seizures. Parents reported satisfaction not only with the surgical outcomes, but also with improvement of cognitive and behavior issues.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

There is an increase in the isolation of non-fermenting gramnegative bacilli in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The present study evaluates the frequency of isolates of Chryseobacterium spp., analyzing its characteristics, resistance patterns and clinical outcome of patients. It has been collected all respiratory isolates of Chryseobacterium spp. of patients attended in the CF unit of Hospital de la Princesa for three years (march 2009-march 2012). For phenotypic and genotypic identification and sensitivity study conventional methodology was used. For the assessment of the patients lung function was considered the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the results were analyzed with SPSS. There was an increase in the incidence of Chryseobacterium spp. with 17 isolates from 9 patients. Three patients had chronic colonization by this microorganism and one showed significant impairment of lung function. Seven patients showed also colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and 4 of them with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chryseobacterium spp. should be considered as a new emerging opportunistic pathogen in patients with CF. It is essential the clinical and microbiological monitoring of this group of patients for detection of Chryseobacterium spp. colonization and to prevent the chronic infection. In these circumstances it must assess its possible eradication, though its clinical impact is unknown. Cotrimoxazole being the best treatment option.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

This study was a retrospective review of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome treated with the modified Atkins diet from May 2009 and March 2011. The diet was initiated in those children who persisted to have daily seizures despite the use of at least 3 appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Twenty-five children were started on a modified Atkins diet, restricting carbohydrate intake to 10 g/d. After 3 months, 2 patients were seizure-free, and 10/25 children had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 6 months, of 11 patients on the diet, 3 were seizure free and 8 had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. At 1 year, all 9 children on diet had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The side effects of the diet were mild. The modified Atkins diet was found to be effective and well tolerated in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24660703	Cystic fibrosis: unenhanced CT description of the appendix in asymptomatic adults	The purpose of this study was to describe the unenhanced CT appearance of the appendix in adults with cystic fibrosis. Among adults with cystic fibrosis undergoing follow-up at our hospital, 71 patients (35 women, 36 men; mean age, 33 years; range, 18-59 years) without a history of appendectomy or current abdominal pain were prospectively included in this study and underwent unenhanced abdominopelvic MDCT. Two readers coded visualization of the appendix, measured the diameter of the appendix, and described the attenuation of its contents in relation to the intestinal wall. They also coded the presence of colonic wall redundancy, pancreatic fatty replacement, and cirrhosis. Lung transplant status and CFTR gene mutations were recorded. Analysis of variance, linear regression analysis, Student t test, and Pearson test were used. The appendix was detected in all patients. The mean diameter was recorded as 10.6 ± 3.5 mm. The mean diameter was larger when the appendix contained hyperattenuating material (p = 0.001). There was no association between diameter and the other coded CT findings (p = 0.076-0.466), transplant status (p = 0.788), or CFTR mutation (p = 0.078). In 75% of the patients, the appendix contained hyperattenuating material with a higher proportion in homozygous ΔF508 mutation (p = 0.029) without any significant effect of the other CT features (p = 0.056-0.392), or transplant status (p = 1.000). The appendix is larger in adults with cystic fibrosis than in those without it and appears hyperattenuating at unenhanced CT in 75% of patients, more commonly in those with ΔF508 homozygous mutation.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

24684645	Budget impact analysis of antiepileptic drugs for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	In October 2011, clobazam was FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a debilitating childhood epilepsy characterized by drop attacks, for patients 2 years and older. To assess the budget impact of adding clobazam to an antiepileptic drug (AED) portfolio containing topiramate, lamotrigine, and rufinamide in a hypothetical, 100,000-member commercially insured health plan. Patient characteristics and AED efficacy (decrease in drop-seizure frequency) were modeled with clinical data. Medical costs were derived from administrative claims data from a large U.S. managed health plan, with the assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures required medical care. Two-year budget impact was measured. Results were expressed as the overall difference in costs (medical and pharmacy) to a health plan and cost per member per month (PMPM) after addition of clobazam. Analyses of alternative scenarios were performed. With the assumption that 0.04% of the plan population had LGS, adding clobazam to the formulary resulted in cost savings of $98,059 in year 1 and $131,690 in year 2 (savings of $0.08 and $0.11 PMPM, respectively). Analyses of alternative scenarios with lower seizure rates upon discontinuation or greater long-term efficacy for lamotrigine and topiramate did not substantially alter conclusions. The assumption that fewer drop seizures required medical care resulted in a savings of approximately $5,000 per year with clobazam, which suggested that medically attended drop seizures drive costs. Medically attended drop seizures are a major cost driver for LGS patients. Adding clobazam to a health plan formulary can have a positive overall budget impact through decreased medical costs associated with drop seizures.

24716008	Evaluation of teriparatide for treatment of osteoporosis in four patients with cystic fibrosis: a case series	Introduction. Bone disease is a common complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). To date, there have been no reports on the effectiveness of teriparatide, recombinant human parathyroid hormone, to treat CF-related bone disease. Case Presentation. We report on four patients with CF-related bone disease who were treated with teriparatide. Three patients completed two years of therapy with teriparatide, and all had significant improvements in their bone mineral density (BMD). One patient was unable to tolerate teriparatide and discontinued treatment 1 week into therapy. Conclusion. Teriparatide may be a potential treatment option for CF-related bone disease. This report highlights the need for further investigation into the use of teripartide in the CF population.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

24722909	MgtE is a dual-function protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes a wide range of infections, including chronic biofilm infections in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. We previously found that the inner-membrane protein MgtE can function both as a magnesium transporter and a virulence modulator, although the exact mechanism governing these activities is unclear. To address this issue, we carried out an experimental characterization of P. aeruginosa MgtE and generated a computer-rendered model. Our in silico analysis demonstrated the structural similarity of P. aeruginosa MgtE to that of the crystal structure of MgtE in Thermus thermophilus. Experimentally, we verified that MgtE is not essential for growth and found that it may not be involved directly in biofilm formation, even under low-magnesium conditions. We demonstrated both magnesium transport and cytotoxicity-regulating functions, and showed that magnesium-binding sites in the connecting helix region of MgtE are vital in coupling these two functions. Furthermore, limiting magnesium environments stimulated mgtE transcriptional responses. Our results suggested that MgtE might play an important role in linking magnesium availability to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24762087	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for cystic fibrosis: the Montpellier center's 10-year experience	This study provides an overview of 10 years of experience of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for cystic fibrosis (CF) in our center. Owing to the high allelic heterogeneity of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations in south of France, we have set up a powerful universal test based on haplotyping eight short tandem repeats (STR) markers together with the major mutation p.Phe508del. Of 142 couples requesting PGD for CF, 76 have been so far enrolled in the genetic work-up, and 53 had 114 PGD cycles performed. Twenty-nine cycles were canceled upon in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment because of hyper- or hypostimulation. Of the remaining 85 cycles, a total of 493 embryos were biopsied and a genetic diagnosis was obtained in 463 (93.9%), of which 262 (without or with a single CF-causing mutation) were transferable. Twenty-eight clinical pregnancies were established, yielding a pregnancy rate per transfer of 30.8% in the group of seven couples with one member affected with CF, and 38.3% in the group of couples whose both members are carriers of a CF-causing mutation [including six couples with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)]. So far, 25 children were born free of CF and no misdiagnosis was recorded. Our test is applicable to 98% of couples at risk of transmitting CF.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

24762861	Role of P-glycoprotein in refractoriness of seizures to antiepileptic drugs in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Mechanism of seizure refractoriness to antiepileptic drugs in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not known. Efflux of antiepileptic drugs due to increased expression/function of P-glycoprotein, a multidrug efflux transporter protein on the cell surface is a proposed mechanism. The authors studied the expression/function of P-glycoprotein on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 29 children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 23 children with other epilepsies, and 19 healthy children. The authors found a higher P-glycoprotein expression/function in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a higher percent positive cells as compared to children with other epilepsy (P < 0.001) and to healthy controls (P = 0.012), higher P-glycoprotein expression as compared to healthy controls (P = 0.003), a higher total P-glycoprotein expression (relative florescence intensity × percent positive cells) as compared to children with other epilepsies (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.001), and a higher P-glycoprotein function as compared to children with other epilepsies (P = 0.001) and healthy controls (P = 0.002).

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is one of the medications used to treat acute pulmonary infectious exacerbations in patients with CF. Hepatic toxicity secondary to TMP-SMX was previously described in normal subjects but has not been reported in children with CF. Here we describe a 14-year-old female child with CF who was given oral TMP-SMX for an acute pulmonary infectious exacerbation. She developed a rash, severe constitutional symptoms, and significant elevation of liver enzyme concentrations secondary to immunity-mediated reaction to TMP-SMX. Discontinuation of TMP-SMX and supportive treatment led to resolution of her symptoms and normalization of liver enzyme concentrations.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

24809226	Asymmetrical generalized paroxysmal fast activities in children with intractable localization-related epilepsy	Generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) consists of burst of generalized rhythmic discharges; 100-200 μV; 1-9s; 8-26 Hz; with frontal predominance; appearing during NREM sleep. GPFA was originally described as an electrographic feature of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). W**e analyzed GPFA on scalp video EEG (VEEG) in children to evaluate that GPFA presents in patients with intractable localization-related epilepsy**. We collected cases with GPFA with intractable localization-related epilepsy who underwent scalp VEEG, MRI, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) prior to intracranial video EEG (IVEEG) and surgical resection. We collected 50 epochs of GPFA per patient during the first night during scalp VEEG. We analyzed amplitude, duration and frequency of GPFA over the bilateral frontal region between surgical resection side with grid placement and non-resection side. We identified 14 (14%) patients with GPFA on scalp VEEG. The mean amplitude ranged from 145 to 589 μV (mean 293 μV). The mean duration ranged from 1.18 to 2.31s (mean 1.6s). The mean frequencies ranged from 9.3 to 14.7 Hz (mean 11.1 Hz). The amplitude (307 ± 156 μV) and duration (1.62 ± 0.8s) of GPFAs in all the patients over the resection side were significantly higher than those (279 ± 141 μV, 1.58 ± 0.8s) of the non-resection side (p<0.001). All nine patients who showed significant duration differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had longer duration of GPFA over the resection side. Eight of 12 patients who showed significant amplitude differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher amplitude of GPFA over the resection side. Four of six patients who showed significant frequency differences between two hemispheres (p<0.05) had higher frequency of GPFA over the resection side. Nine (64%) patients became seizure free after surgical resection including multilobar resections in eight patients. GPFA can exist in localization-related epilepsy with secondary bilateral synchrony. Although EEG shows GPFA on scalp VEEG, the precise localization of the epileptogenic zone using IVEEG could achieve the successful surgical resection.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

24811693	Respiratory exacerbations in indigenous children from two countries with non-cystic fibrosis chronic suppurative lung disease/bronchiectasis	Acute respiratory exacerbations (AREs) cause morbidity and lung function decline in children with chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, we determined the patterns of AREs and factors related to increased risks for AREs in children with CSLD/bronchiectasis. Ninety-three indigenous children aged 0.5 to 8 years with CSLD/bronchiectasis in Australia (n = 57) and Alaska (n = 36) during 2004 to 2009 were followed for > 3 years. Standardized parent interviews, physical examinations, and medical record reviews were undertaken at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Ninety-three children experienced 280 AREs (median = 2, range = 0-11 per child) during the 3-year period; 91 (32%) were associated with pneumonia, and 43 (15%) resulted in hospitalization. Of the 93 children, 69 (74%) experienced more than two AREs over the 3-year period, and 28 (30%) had more than one ARE in each study year. The frequency of AREs declined significantly over each year of follow-up. Factors associated with recurrent (two or more) AREs included age < 3 years, ARE-related hospitalization in the first year of life, and pneumonia or hospitalization for ARE in the year preceding enrollment. Factors associated with hospitalizations for AREs in the first year of study included age < 3 years, female caregiver education, and regular use of bronchodilators. AREs are common in children with CSLD/bronchiectasis, but with clinical care and time AREs occur less frequently. All children with CSLD/bronchiectasis require comprehensive care; however, treatment strategies may differ for these patients based on their changing risks for AREs during each year of care.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

24906615	Efficacy and safety of felbamate in children with refractory epilepsy	Despite the introduction of multiple new antiepileptic drugs in the past two decades, many patients with epilepsy continue to experience uncontrolled seizures or significant side effects. To present our experience with felbamate therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and video-EEG recordings of all patients receiving felbamate until May 2012. Efficacy was determined according to seizure frequency during the week prior to treatment initiation and the week after the maximal dosage of felbamate was reached. Fifty patients (34 boys) aged 4 months to 17 years (mean--5.5 years) were identified. Nearly third of the patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Mean epilepsy duration was 3.4 years (range--1 month to 13 years). The mean number of previous antiepileptic drugs was 7.5. The mean duration of follow-up was 1.1 years. Seizure frequency decreased by at least 50% in 29 (58%) patients. Side effects were reported in 22 (44%) patients, none of them included aplastic anemia or liver failure. In the responder group, the maximal dose of felbamate was lower and the patients were older compared to non-responders. Despite current recommendations, felbamate is initiated following multiple AEDs. Based on its efficacy and safety data, earlier initiation of felbamate is recommended in children with refractory epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

24908055	The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry: valuable lessons learned on how to sustain a disease registry	Disease registries have the invaluable potential to provide an insight into the natural history of the disease under investigation, to provide useful information (e.g. through health indicators) for planning health care services and to identify suitable groups of patients for clinical trials enrolment. However, the establishment and maintenance of disease registries is a burdensome initiative from economical and organisational points of view and experience sharing on registries management is important to avoid waste of resources. The aim of this paper is to discuss the problems embedded in the institution and management of an international disease registry to warn against common mistakes that can derail the best of intentions: we share the experience of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry, which collects data on almost 30,000 patients from 23 countries. We discuss the major problems that researchers often encounter in the creation and management of disease registries: definition of the aims the registry has to reach, definition of the criteria for patients referral to the registry, definition of the information to record, set up of a data quality process, handling of missing data, maintenance of data confidentiality, regulation of data use and dissemination of research results. We give examples on how many crucial aspects were solved by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry regarding objectives, inclusion criteria and variables definition, data management, data quality controls, missing data handling, confidentiality maintenance, data use and results dissemination. We suggest an extensive literature research and discussions in working groups with different stake holders, including patient representatives, on the objectives, inclusion criteria and the information to record. We propose to pilot the recording of few variables and test the applicability of their definition first. The use of a shared electronic platform for data collection that automatically computes derived variables, and automatically performs basic data quality controls is a good data management practice, that also helps in reducing missing data. We found crucial for success the collaboration with existing national and international registries, cystic fibrosis organisations and patients' associations.	cystic fibrosis			389	The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry: valuable lessons learned on how to sustain a disease registry.

We discuss the major problems that researchers often encounter in the creation and management of disease registries: definition of the aims the registry has to reach, definition of the criteria for patients referral to the registry, definition of the information to record, set up of a data quality process, handling of missing data, maintenance of data confidentiality, regulation of data use and dissemination of research results. We give examples on how many crucial aspects were solved by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry regarding objectives, inclusion criteria and variables definition, data management, data quality controls, missing data handling, confidentiality maintenance, data use and results dissemination. We suggest an extensive literature research and discussions in working groups with different stake holders, including patient representatives, on the objectives, inclusion criteria and the information to record. We propose to pilot the recording of few variables and test the applicability of their definition first. The use of a shared electronic platform for data collection that automatically computes derived variables, and automatically performs basic data quality controls is a good data management practice, that also helps in reducing missing data. We found crucial for success the collaboration with existing national and international registries, cystic fibrosis organisations and patients' associations.

24914212	An interactive network of elastase, secretases, and PAR-2 protein regulates CXCR1 receptor surface expression on neutrophils	CXCL8 (IL-8) recruits and activates neutrophils through the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR1. We showed previously that elastase cleaves CXCR1 and thereby impairs antibacterial host defense. However, the molecular intracellular machinery involved in this process remained undefined. Here we demonstrate by using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, subcellular fractionation, co-immunoprecipitation, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer that combined α- and γ-secretase activities are functionally involved in elastase-mediated regulation of CXCR1 surface expression on human neutrophils, whereas matrix metalloproteases are dispensable. We further demonstrate that PAR-2 is stored in mobilizable compartments in neutrophils. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that secretases, PAR-2, and CXCR1 colocalize and physically interact in a novel protease/secretase-chemokine receptor network. PAR-2 blocking experiments provided evidence that elastase increased intracellular presenilin-1 expression through PAR-2 signaling. When viewed in combination, these studies establish a novel functional network of elastase, secretases, and PAR-2 that regulate CXCR1 expression on neutrophils. Interfering with this network could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in neutrophilic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or rheumatoid arthritis.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24945463	Stabilizing rescued surface-localized δf508 CFTR by potentiation of its interaction with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in CFTR, a plasma-membrane-localized anion channel. The most common mutation in CFTR, deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508), causes misfolding of CFTR resulting in little or no protein at the plasma membrane. The CFTR corrector VX-809 shows promise for treating CF patients homozygous for ΔF508. Here, we demonstrate the significance of protein-protein interactions in enhancing the stability of the ΔF508 CFTR mutant channel protein at the plasma membrane. We determined that VX-809 prolongs the stability of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane. Using competition-based assays, we demonstrated that ΔF508 CFTR interacts poorly with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) compared to wild-type CFTR, and VX-809 significantly increased this binding affinity. We conclude that stabilized CFTR-NHERF1 interaction is a determinant of the functional efficiency of rescued ΔF508 CFTR. Our results demonstrate the importance of macromolecular-complex formation in stabilizing rescued mutant CFTR at the plasma membrane and suggest this to be foundational for the development of a new generation of effective CFTR-corrector-based therapeutics.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24949576	Withdrawal-related adverse events from clinical trials of clobazam in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	To assess withdrawal-related adverse event (AE) rates following abrupt clobazam discontinuation in Phase I trials and gradual clobazam tapering (2-3 weeks) following discontinuation from III trials met the criteria for potential/III trials, we evaluated AE data from four multiple-dosage Phase I trials (duration: 8-34 days). Therapeutic (20 and 40 mg/day) and supratherapeutic clobazam dosages (120 and 160 mg/day) were administered. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome enrolled in Phase II (OV-1002) and Phase III (OV-1012) studies (duration ≤15 weeks) and in the open-label extension (OLE) trial OV-1004 (≤5 years). Potential withdrawal-related AEs were identified by preferred terms, provided that the AEs occurred ≥1 day following and ≤30 days after the last clobazam doses, or were deemed withdrawal symptoms by investigators. Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B) scale was used to evaluate withdrawal intensity in three of the four Phase I trials. A total of 207 participants in Phase I trials received steady-state clobazam dosages of 20-160 mg/day, 182 received clobazam dosages of ≥40 mg/day, and 94 received clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Abrupt clobazam discontinuation led to 193 withdrawal-related AEs for 68 Phase I participants. Nearly 50% of AEs occurred after discontinuation of clobazam dosages of ≥120 mg/day. Adverse events were mild or moderate and included headache (14% of Phase I participants), insomnia (12.6%), tremor (10.1%), and anxiety (8.7%). The CIWA-B scores varied (range: 0-59). Most scores were <30, indicating possible mild benzodiazepine withdrawal. III trials met the criteria for potential/III patients received clobazam dosages of ≤40 mg/day, and those in the OLE trial received clobazam dosages of ≤80 mg/day. Eighty-seven patients discontinued clobazam and were gradually tapered. No withdrawal-related AEs or incidences of status epilepticus were reported. Withdrawal-related AEs observed in Phase I studies following abrupt clobazam discontinuation at therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosages were generally mild. No withdrawal-related AEs occurred when dosages were tapered over 3 weeks, after short- or long-term clobazam use (≤5 years).	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

24958810	Heterogeneous spectrum of mutations in CFTR gene from Indian patients with congenital absence of the vas deferens and their association with cystic fibrosis genetic modifiers	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually considered a rare disease in the Indian population. Two studies have reported on the frequency of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in Indian males with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD), however, data on the spectrum of CFTR gene mutations are still lacking. Therefore, the present study was designed to identify the spectrum of CFTR gene mutations as well as to investigate an association of CF genetic modifiers in the penetrance of CAVD in infertile Indian men. A total of 60 consecutive infertile males with a diagnosis of CAVD were subjected to CFTR gene analysis which revealed 13 different CFTR gene mutations and 1 intronic variant that led to aberrant splicing. p.Phe508del (n = 16) and p.Arg117His (n = 4) were among the most common severe forms of CFTR mutations identified. The IVS8-T5 allele, which is considered as a mild form of CFTR mutation, was found with an allelic frequency of 28.3%. Eight novel mutations were also identified in the CFTR gene from our patient cohort. It is noteworthy that the spectrum of CFTR gene mutation is heterogeneous, with exon 4 and exon 11 as hot spot regions. Moreover, we also found an association of the CF genetic modifiers, viz., transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and endothelial receptor type-A (EDNRA) genes with the CAVD phenotype. The findings are of considerable clinical significance because men suffering from infertility due to CAVD can decide to use artificial reproduction technology. The children of men with CAVD are at risk of carrying CFTR mutations; therefore, genetic counseling is a crucial step for such patients. With special reference to developing countries, such as India, where whole gene sequencing is not feasible, the outcome of our study will make the screening procedure for CFTR gene simpler and more cost-effective as we have identified hot spot regions of the CFTR gene which are more prone to mutation in Indian males with CAVD. Moreover, this is the first study from the Indian population to investigate the association of CF genetic modifiers with penetrance of the CAVD phenotype. The observed association of the genetic modifiers TGF-β1 and EDNRA in the penetrance of CAVD further supports their involvement in genesis of the vas deferens.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

24973281	A CFTR corrector (lumacaftor) and a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor) for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who have a phe508del CFTR mutation: a phase 2 randomised controlled trial	The phe508del CFTR mutation causes cystic fibrosis by limiting the amount of CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface. We tested combination treatment with lumacaftor, an investigational CFTR corrector that increases trafficking of phe508del CFTR to the cell surface, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that enhances chloride transport of CFTR on the cell surface. In this phase 2 clinical trial, we assessed three successive cohorts, with the results of each cohort informing dose selection for the subsequent cohort. We recruited patients from 24 cystic fibrosis centres in Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligibility criteria were: confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, age at least 18 years, and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 40% or more than predicted. Cohort 1 included phe508del CFTR homozygous patients randomly assigned to either lumacaftor 200 mg once per day for 14 days followed by addition of ivacaftor 150 mg or 250 mg every 12 h for 7 days, or 21 days of placebo. Together, cohorts 2 and 3 included phe508del CFTR homozygous and heterozygous patients, randomly assigned to either 56 days of lumacaftor (cohort 2: 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg once per day, cohort 3: 400 mg every 12 h) with ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h added after 28 days, or 56 days of placebo. The primary outcomes for all cohorts were change in sweat chloride concentration during the combination treatment period in the intention-to-treat population and safety (laboratory measurements and adverse events). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01225211, and EudraCT, number 2010-020413-90. Cohort 1 included 64 participants. Cohort 2 and 3 combined contained 96 phe508del CFTR homozygous patients and 28 compound heterozygotes. Treatment with lumacaftor 200 mg once daily and ivacaftor 250 mg every 12 h decreased mean sweat chloride concentration by 9.1 mmol/L (p<0.001) during the combination treatment period in cohort 1. In cohorts 2 and 3, mean sweat chloride concentration did not decrease significantly during combination treatment in any group. Frequency and nature of adverse events were much the same in the treatment and placebo groups during the combination treatment period; the most commonly reported events were respiratory. 12 of 97 participants had chest tightness or dyspnoea during treatment with lumacaftor alone. In pre-planned secondary analyses, a significant decrease in sweat chloride concentration occurred in the treatment groups between day 1 and day 56 (lumacaftor 400 mg once per day group -9.1 mmol/L, p<0.001; lumacaftor 600 mg once per day group -8.9 mmol/L, p<0.001; lumacaftor 400 mg every 12 h group -10.3 mmol/L, p=0.002). These changes were significantly greater than the change in the placebo group. In cohort 2, the lumacaftor 600 mg once per day significantly improved FEV1 from day 1 to 56 (difference compared with placebo group: +5.6 percentage points, p=0.013), primarily during the combination period. In cohort 3, FEV1 did not change significantly across the entire study period compared with placebo (difference +4.2 percentage points, p=0.132), but did during the combination period (difference +7.7 percentage points, p=0·003). Phe508del CFTR heterozygous patients did not have a significant improvement in FEV1. We provide evidence that combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor improves FEV1 for patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for phe508del CFTR, with a modest effect on sweat chloride concentration. These results support the further exploration of combination lumacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment in this setting.

25010405	A possible alternative exercise test for youths with cystic fibrosis: the steep ramp test	The steep ramp test (SRT) can be used to provide an indication of exercise capacity when gas exchange measurements are not possible. This study evaluated the clinical usefulness of the SRT in adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) and compared the physiological responses of the SRT with the standard cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Forty patients with CF (17 boys and 23 girls; mean ± SD age, 14.7 ± 1.7 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 86% ± 18% of predicted) performed an SRT and a CPET with respiratory gas analysis in a randomized balanced design. Peak work rate (WRpeak), HRpeak, peak minute ventilation (V˙Epeak), and peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2peak) were the main outcome measures. Patients with CF attained values for absolute and relative WRpeak during the SRT of 82% ± 14% and 92% ± 14% of predicted. Nutritional status and degree of airway obstruction did not influence SRT performance. Significantly higher values were attained for WRpeak during the SRT compared with those during the CPET (252 ± 60 vs 174 ± 46 W; P < 0.001), whereas significantly lower values were achieved for HRpeak (168 ± 14 vs 182 ± 12 bpm; P < 0.001), V˙Epeak (59.2 ± 19.5 vs 72.0 ± 20.2 L·min(-1); P = 0.006), and V˙O2peak (36.9 ± 7.5 vs 41.5 ± 7.6 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1); P = 0.008). A strong correlation between WRpeak attained at the SRT and the V˙O2peak achieved during the CPET was found (r = 0.822, P < 0.001). The SRT seems to be a quick, convenient, and low-cost exercise test that is well-tolerated in patients with CF with mild-to-moderate airway obstruction. It provides an indication of exercise capacity and can potentially be used when exercise testing using gas exchange measurements is not possible.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) belongs to the group of epileptic encephalopathies that often prove refractory to AED treatment.** In this prospective study we assess the efficacy and tolerability of the KD in patients with LGS**. Between March 1, 1990 and April 1, 2013, 61 patients who met diagnostic criteria of LGS were seen at our department. **Twenty of them were placed on the KD and followed for a minimum of 16 months.** The children had previously received a mean of 6.5 different AEDs and were on a mean of 2.5 AEDs when the diet was started. Eighteen months after initiating the diet, fifteen of the initial patients (75%) remained on the diet; three patients (15%) were seizure free, three (15%) had a 75-99% decrease in seizures, two (10%) had a 50-74% decrease in seizures, and the remaining seven children (35%) had a <50% decrease in seizures. Three seizure-free patients were tapered off the diet after remaining seizure free. In the three patients who had a 75-99% decrease in seizures AEDs were reduced. The KD is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with LGS, not only for those with cryptogenic, but also for those with structural LGS. The diet should be considered early in the course of this syndrome.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4. PATIENT-BASED THERAPEUTICS		294	Ketogenic diet in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

25048732	Pulmonary radiographic findings in young children with cystic fibrosis	Pulmonary evaluation is one of the greatest challenges in children with cystic fibrosis who are younger than 6 years. Although chest CT can provide the most information for initial and progressive changes in cystic fibrosis, the radiation exposures can lead to significant cumulative exposure in children as they are followed with serial scanning to monitor early and progressive disease. Therefore the systematized study of chest radiographs using the Brasfield score has been used scientifically with the aim of evaluating the evolution of pulmonary abnormalities in children with cystic fibrosis. This study was performed to assess the radiologic findings in children younger than 6 years with cystic fibrosis. We used the Brasfield score to compare radiographs performed in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa vs. oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and to compare radiographs in children with early vs. delayed diagnosis. A total of 254 chest radiographs from 67 children who had undergone material cultures of the airways as part of routine care were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The statistical analysis was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, with a significance level of 5%. Approximately 35.8% of chest radiographs had a Brasfield score lower than 21 points, which is compatible with potentially irreversible pulmonary disease. Brasfield scores decreased (this score decreases with increasing disease severity) in older children, and both bacterial colonization with Pseudomonas and later diagnosis were associated with lower (greater disease) scores. The evaluation of radiographs using the Brasfield score demonstrated the most important pulmonary findings in cystic fibrosis and identified the age group when these alterations began to appear more pronounced.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

25051969	Successful Treatment of Refractory Seizures With Rufinamide in Children With Schizencephaly: Report of 3 Cases	Schizencephaly is an uncommon malformation of cortical development. Patients with schizencephaly present with a broad range of severe neurologic symptoms including pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Rufinamide is a new antiepileptic drug approved for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and it is also effective for refractory partial seizures.** We report 3 cases of pediatric patients aged 7.2, 8.1, and 10.1 years, respectively, with intractable epilepsy associated with bilateral open-lip schizencephaly and septo-optic dysplasia. **The follow-up ranged from 3.8 to 4.1 years. In our patients, the introduction of rufinamide as adjunctive drug led to a dramatic decline in the number of seizures and an improvement in EEG epileptic activity without side effects. Rufinamide seems to be efficacious and safe in patients with epileptic encephalopathies associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy; further and larger clinical reports and controlled studies could confirm the usefulness of this anticonvulsant drug.

25076714	Epidemiological evaluation regarding the role of cystic fibrosis as a risk factor for child malnutrition	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic autosomal recessive disorder with progressive chronic evolution which is potentially lethal. Poor growth is a characteristic of children suffering from cystic fibrosis. A poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for inadequate survival in cystic fibrosis and is associated with disease complications. The appropriate nutritional management is an important part of the treatment so that the patient with cystic fibrosis can achieve normal growth and development and maintain the best possible health status. A balanced diet supplemented with snacks high in fat and calories is necessary to increase the caloric intake in children with cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis have higher caloric needs than healthy children of the same age and sex. Malnutrition in CF is multifactorial. Cystic fibrosis is a complex multisystem disorder affecting mainly the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. In the past, malnutrition was an inevitable consequence of disease progression, leading to poor growth, impaired respiratory muscle function, decreased exercise tolerance and immunological impairment. A positive association between body weight and height and survival has been widely reported. The energy requirements of patients with CF vary widely and generally increase with age and disease severity. Cystic fibrosis remains a paediatric disorder which is often underdiagnosed but which, if therapeutically managed properly (by means of drug therapy as well as by appropriate physiotherapy techniques), can lead to improved quality of life and, thus, to a bigger life expectancy.	cystic fibrosis	0.3.

25082229	Common and distinctive pathogenetic features of arteriovenous malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 animal models--brief report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25098631	Combined liver and lung transplantation with extended normothermic lung preservation in a patient with end-stage emphysema complicated by drug-induced acute liver failure	Isolated lung transplantation (LuTx) and liver transplantation are established treatments for irreversible lung and liver failure. Combined liver and lung transplantation (cLiLuTx) is a less common, but approved therapy of combined organ failure, mostly applied in patients suffering from progressive cystic fibrosis and advanced liver disease. We report a patient who was listed for LuTx due to end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and who developed drug-induced acute hepatic failure. The only therapeutic option was hyper-urgent cLiLuTx. To correct the poor coagulation in order to reduce the per-operative risk of bleeding, the liver was transplanted first. In anticipation of the longer lung preservation time, cold flushed lungs were preserved on a portable lung perfusion device for ex vivo normothermic perfusion for 11 h 15 min, transplanted sequentially off-pump, and reperfused after a total ex vivo time of 13 h 32 min and 16 h for the first and second lung, respectively. Ten months later, the patient is doing well and no rejection occurred. Normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion may help to prolong preservation time, facilitating long-distance transport and combined organ transplantation.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

25114233	Microbial-induced meprin β cleavage in MUC2 mucin and a functional CFTR channel are required to release anchored small intestinal mucus	The mucus that covers and protects the epithelium of the intestine is built around its major structural component, the gel-forming MUC2 mucin. The gel-forming mucins have traditionally been assumed to be secreted as nonattached. The colon has a two-layered mucus system where the inner mucus is attached to the epithelium, whereas the small intestine normally has a nonattached mucus. However, the mucus of the small intestine of meprin β-deficient mice was now found to be attached. Meprin β is an endogenous zinc-dependent metalloprotease now shown to cleave the N-terminal region of the MUC2 mucin at two specific sites. When recombinant meprin β was added to the attached mucus of meprin β-deficient mice, the mucus was detached from the epithelium. Similar to meprin β-deficient mice, germ-free mice have attached mucus as they did not shed the membrane-anchored meprin β into the luminal mucus. The ileal mucus of cystic fibrosis (CF) mice with a nonfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel was recently shown to be attached to the epithelium. Addition of recombinant meprin β to CF mucus did not release the mucus, but further addition of bicarbonate rendered the CF mucus normal, suggesting that MUC2 unfolding exposed the meprin β cleavage sites. Mucus is thus secreted attached to the goblet cells and requires an enzyme, meprin β in the small intestine, to be detached and released into the intestinal lumen. This process regulates mucus properties, can be triggered by bacterial contact, and is nonfunctional in CF due to poor mucin unfolding.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

25125390	Testosterone decreases fluid and chloride secretions in the uterus of adult female rats via down-regulating cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) expression and functional activity	Estrogen is known to stimulate uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretion via CFTR. This study investigated testosterone effect on these changes in a rat model. Ovariectomized adult female rats received estrogen for five days or estrogen for three days followed by two days peanut oil or testosterone either alone or in the presence of flutamide or finasteride. At the end of treatment, uteri were perfused with perfusate containing CFTRinh-172. The rate of fluid and Cl(-) secretion were determined. Dose-dependent effect of testosterone and effect of forskolin on fluid secretion rate were measured. Animals were sacrificed and uteri were removed for CFTR protein and mRNA expression analyses, histology and cAMP measurement. Morphology of uterus, levels of expression of CFTR protein and mRNA and distribution of CFTR protein were observed. Estrogen causes increase while testosterone causes decrease in uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretions. The effects of estrogen but not testosterone were antagonized by CFTRinh-172. Luminal fluid volume and apical expression of CFTR in the luminal epithelia were highest under estrogen and lowest under testosterone influences. Similar changes were observed in CFTR protein and mRNA expressions. Uterine cAMP level was highest under estrogen and lowest under testosterone influence. Forskolin increases fluid secretion rate in estrogen but not in testosterone-treated animals. Testosterone effects were dose-dependent and were antagonized by flutamide however, not finasteride. Testosterone inhibition of estrogen-induced uterine fluid and Cl(-) secretion occurs via inhibition of CFTR expression and functional activities. These changes could explain the adverse effects of testosterone on fertility.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

However, there are few cases that a single patient suffers both cerebral AVM and pulmonary AVM. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is universally accepted as an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which represents telangiectasia is frequently multiple AVMs in internal organs. Very few non-HHT cases were diagnosed as cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. **We report one case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs diagnosed as non-HHT to share our experience. **This report aims to find the way of identifying non-HHT case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs in early periods. To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

25184741	Efficacy and tolerability of methylprednisolone pulse therapy in childhood epilepsies other than infantile spasms	This retrospective study included 54 children with epilepsy. The treatment consisted of four pulses with single doses of 20 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone (MPR), administered every week on 3 consecutive days. After this initial phase, the intervals between the pulses were increased based on individual factors. MPR pulses were administered exclusively orally in 39 patients and 7.8% of all pulses were applied intravenously. After four pulses, 30 of 54 (56%) patients were responders, according to several clinical and electroencephalography criteria. A response was obtained in 12 of 20 (60%) cases with genetic, 7 of 17 (41%) with structural metabolic, and 11 of 17 (65%) with unknown etiology. Responder rates were 11 of 15 (73%) in patients with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep (CSWS) or Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 2 of 6 in patients with myoclonic astatic epilepsy or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and 17 of 31 (55%) in patients with unclassified epilepsies. A response was not correlated with any epilepsy-related clinical factor. The patients received a median of eight MPR pulses (range, 1-52), and the median duration of the therapy was 11 weeks. The response was maintained in 19 of 30 (63%) patients, and 3 of 24 (13%) without initial response became seizure-free (total responder rate at the end of the therapy 22/54 [41%]).

25219353	Rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Japan	To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in a** randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial**. We conducted a multicenter clinical trial with a 4-week baseline, a 2-week titration, a 10-week maintenance, and either a follow-up visit or entry into an open-label extension. Patients with LGS (4 to 30 years old) taking between one and three antiepileptic drugs were recruited. After the baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to rufinamide or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days. Of the 59 patients, 29 were randomized to the rufinamide group and 30 to the placebo group. The frequency of epileptic seizures was significantly decreased in the rufinamide group than in the placebo group; the median percent change in frequency of tonic-atonic seizures was -24.2% and -3.3%, respectively, (p=0.003) and that of total seizures was -32.9% and -3.1%, respectively (p<0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of rufinamide was consistent independent of clinical background characteristics. The common treatment-related adverse events in the rufinamide group were decreased appetite (17.2%), somnolence (17.2%), and vomiting (13.8%). Transient seizure aggravations were observed in 13 (22.0%) of the 59 patients, though a causal relationship with rufinamide was suspected in only one patient. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The mean plasma concentration of rufinamide between 1 and 9 within 12h after administration was 17.2 μg/mL. The present results showed a favorable risk-benefit profile for rufinamide as an adjunctive therapy for patients with LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

25219836	Non-invasive detection of Helicobacter pylori in cystic fibrosis--the fecal test vs. the urea breath test	Only recently it has been proven that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have the same prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP infection) as the general population, as well as the same spectrum of changes caused by this pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of the two most popular noninvasive tests--the urea breath test (UBT) and the fecal test (FT) in diagnosing HP infection in CF patients. The study was conducted on 79 CF patients and 49 healthy subjects (HS). The presence of HP infection was evaluated using the 13C isotope-labeled urea breath test and the fecal test (ELISA). Fifteen (19.0%) CF patients and eight (16.3%) HS were found to be HP positive using the UBT. The HP stool antigen was detected in twelve (15.2%) CF patients and seven (14.3%) HS. Discordant results for the two tests were obtained in 9 out of 18 (50.0%) CF patients and 3 out of 9 (33.3%) HS. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the risk of potentially false negative and false positive results in CF subjects seems to be high. Similarly, no statistical differences in the basic clinical parameters were documented between the CF subgroups with concordant and divergent HP results. Since there is convincing evidence of divergent UBT and FT results in the CF patients, we suggest that UBT is kept as the standard method for HP detection in this population, at least until obtaining reliable and valid results allows for a change in such an approach.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

Since there is convincing evidence of divergent UBT and FT results in the CF patients, we suggest that UBT is kept as the standard method for HP detection in this population, at least until obtaining reliable and valid results allows for a change in such an approach.
25222606	Effect of different breathing aids on ventilation distribution in adults with cystic fibrosis	We investigated the effect of different breathing aids on ventilation distribution in healthy adults and subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). In 11 healthy adults and 9 adults with CF electrical impedance tomography measurements were performed during spontaneous breathing, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy randomly applied in upright and lateral position. Spatial and temporal ventilation distribution was assessed. The proportion of ventilation directed to the dependent lung significantly increased in lateral position compared to upright in healthy and CF. This effect was enhanced with CPAP but neutralised with PEP, whereas the effect of PEP was larger in the healthy group. Temporal ventilation distribution showed exactly the opposite with homogenisation during CPAP and increased inhomogeneity with PEP. PEP shows distinct differences to CPAP with respect to its impact on ventilation distribution in healthy adults and CF subjects EIT might be used to individualise respiratory physiotherapy.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

25231724	Vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy: a European long-term study up to 24 months in 347 children	To gain insight into the long-term impact of vagus nerve stimulation (with VNS Therapy) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy,** we conducted the largest retrospective multicenter study to date over an extended follow-up period of up to 24 months**. The primary objective was to assess change in seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type (defined as the most disabling seizure) following VNS device implantation. Treating physicians collected data from patient records from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. The analysis population included 347 children (aged 6 months to 17.9 years at the time of implant). At 6, 12, and 24 months after implantation, 32.5%, 37.6%, and 43.8%, respectively, of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in baseline seizure frequency of the predominant seizure type. The responder rate was higher in a subgroup of patients who had no change in antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during the study. Favorable results were also evident for all secondary outcome measures including changes in seizure duration, ictal severity, postictal severity, quality of life, clinical global impression of improvement, and safety. Post hoc analyses demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between VNS total charge delivered per day and an increase in response rate. VNS Therapy is indicated as adjunctive therapy in children with focal, structural epilepsies, who for any reason are not good candidates for surgical treatment following the trial of two or more AEDs. Children with predominantly generalized seizures from genetic, structural epilepsies, like Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, could also benefit from VNS Therapy. The results demonstrate that adjunctive VNS Therapy in children with drug-resistant epilepsy reduces seizure frequency and is well tolerated over a 2-year follow-up period. No new safety issues were identified. A post hoc analysis revealed a dose-response correlation for VNS in patients with epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

25249647	Cough characteristics and FVC maneuver in cystic fibrosis	Cough is part of life in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Weak coughing may add to increased respiratory disease that affects the mechanical properties of cough in these patients. In this study, we investigated cough characteristics in relation to forced expiratory flow/volume indices in CF. This prospective study included 54 subjects (26 ± 10 y old) with CF. Similar indices of the maneuvers were compared. Additionally, other cough characteristics revealed by the maneuvers were investigated. Cough was considered efficient with 6 or more secondary spikes at a flow of > 2.67 L/s. Cough peak flows similar to peak expiratory flows (regardless of FEV1 severity level) were found in 98% of subjects. The secondary spike flows deteriorated alongside the percent-of-predicted FEV1 (r(2) = 0.17, P = .002), yet inefficient secondary spike flows could also be found when FEV1 was within normal range. Mean efficient spike number was low (2.5 ± 1.2 spikes/maneuver). Most cough spike flows were very small (< 0.9 L/s), resembling vibration that may contribute to the propulsion of mucus toward the central airways. Cough maneuver duration ended faster than forced expiration duration (3.7 ± 1.7 s vs 6.8 ± 2.5 s, P < .001), resulting in a smaller cough vital capacity compared with expiratory vital capacity (2.1 ± 0.9 l vs 3.1 ± 0.7 l, P < .001). Inspiratory volume below 2.23 ± 0.07 L reduced efficient secondary spike number. The cough flow/volume maneuver reveals abnormalities in cough velocities and volume. A low secondary spike correlates with FEV1 severity level. The method may lead to earlier intervention to assist cough in CF.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

25262651	De novo mutations in synaptic transmission genes including DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathies	"Emerging evidence indicates that epileptic encephalopathies are genetically highly heterogeneous, underscoring the need for large cohorts of well-characterized individuals to further define the genetic landscape. Through a collaboration between two consortia (EuroEPINOMICS and Epi4K/EPGP), we analyzed exome-sequencing data of 356 trios with the ""classical"" epileptic encephalopathies, infantile spasms and Lennox Gastaut syndrome, including 264 trios previously analyzed by the Epi4K/EPGP consortium. In this expanded cohort, we find 429 de novo mutations, including de novo mutations in DNM1 in five individuals and de novo mutations in GABBR2, FASN, and RYR3 in two individuals each. Unlike previous studies, this cohort is sufficiently large to show a significant excess of de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy probands compared to the general population using a likelihood analysis (p = 8.2 × 10(-4)), supporting a prominent role for de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies. We bring statistical evidence that mutations in DNM1 cause epileptic encephalopathy, find suggestive evidence for a role of three additional genes, and show that at least 12% of analyzed individuals have an identifiable causal de novo mutation. Strikingly, 75% of mutations in these probands are predicted to disrupt a protein involved in regulating synaptic transmission, and there is a significant enrichment of de novo mutations in genes in this pathway in the entire cohort as well.

25266269	A case of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a patient with FOXG1-related disorder	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathy of childhood with a heterogeneous etiology. Recently, genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of new de novo mutations associated with this epileptic syndrome. Herein, we report an 8-year-old child with intellectual disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, Rett-like features, and LGS, carrying a de novo missense mutation in the forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene. This gene is responsible for FOXG1 syndrome, characterized by severe postnatal microcephaly, moderate postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation with poor social interaction, stereotyped behavior and dyskinesias, absent language, sleep disorders, and epilepsy. Nonspecific epilepsy syndromes have been associated with this genetic disorder. Thus, we hypothesize that FOXG1 might be a new candidate gene in the etiology of LGS and suggest screening for this gene in cases of LGS with concomitant microcephaly and clinical features overlapping with Rett syndrome.

25282105	Clobazam is efficacious for patients across the spectrum of disease severity of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: post hoc analyses of clinical trial results by baseline seizure-frequency quartiles and VNS experience	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) severity varies considerably, so the potential impact of differences in baseline severity on patient outcome following treatment is clinically informative. Here, two surrogate indicators of LGS severity (baseline seizure frequency and vagus nerve stimulation [VNS] use) were used in post hoc analyses of both short- and long-term clobazam trials (Phase III OV-1012 [CONTAIN] and open-label extension [OLE] OV-1004). In CONTAIN, 217 patients comprised the modified, intention-to-treat population. Each baseline seizure-frequency quartile had ~40 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure frequency ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-30 (Quartile 2), 32-86 (Quartile 3), and 86-1077 (Quartile 4). Mean percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar for all quartiles. More than 50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly drop- and total-seizure frequency. The percentage of patients achieving 100% reduction in drop seizures was 33% for clobazam-treated patients (vs. 7% for placebo) in Quartile 1. Five percent of clobazam-treated patients in Quartile 4 (most severe LGS) vs. 0% for placebo achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures. A total of 267 of 306 possible patients entered the OLE (61/68 from a Phase II study and 206/238 from Phase III CONTAIN). Each quartile had ~66 patients, and baseline weekly drop-seizure ranges were as follows: <10 (Quartile 1), 10-31 (Quartile 2), 32-110 (Quartile 3), and 111-1147 (Quartile 4). Median percentage decreases in average weekly drop and total seizures were similar between quartiles. Through 5 years of therapy, >50% of patients in all 4 quartiles demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in weekly frequency for drop seizures. More than 12% of patients in Quartile 4 achieved 100% reduction in drop seizures from Month 3 through Year 5. For the VNS analyses in CONTAIN, the least-squares mean decreases in average weekly rate of drop seizures (mITT population) were 52% for VNS patients receiving clobazam vs. -22% for placebo (p < 0.01). For non-VNS patients, these percentages were 53% for clobazam and 26% for placebo (p < 0.01). Moreover, 50% and 54% of clobazam-treated patients in the VNS and non-VNS groups demonstrated ≥ 50% decreases in average weekly drop- and total-seizure frequencies, and 11% and 14% in the two groups achieved drop-seizure freedom, respectively. Analyses using baseline seizure frequency and VNS use as surrogates for disease severity showed that clobazam treatment of patients with less severe or severe LGS was equally efficacious.

25287046	Full-open and closed CFTR channels, with lateral tunnels from the cytoplasm and an alternative position of the F508 region, as revealed by molecular dynamics	In absence of experimental 3D structures, several homology models, based on ABC exporter 3D structures, have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel whose defects are associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Until now, these models, however, did not furnished much insights into the continuous way that ions could follow from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in the open form of the channel. Here, we have built a refined model of CFTR, based on the outward-facing Sav1866 experimental 3D structure and integrating the evolutionary and structural information available today. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant conformational changes, resulting in a full-open channel, accessible from the cytosol through lateral tunnels displayed in the long intracellular loops (ICLs). At the same time, the region of nucleotide-binding domain 1 in contact with one of the ICLs and carrying amino acid F508, the deletion of which is the most common CF-causing mutation, was found to adopt an alternative but stable position. Then, in a second step, this first stable full-open conformation evolved toward another stable state, in which only a limited displacement of the upper part of the transmembrane helices leads to a closure of the channel, in a conformation very close to that adopted by the Atm1 ABC exporter, in an inward-facing conformation. These models, supported by experimental data, provide significant new insights into the CFTR structure-function relationships and into the possible impact of CF-causing mutations.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

25301526	Characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae clones from paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis	The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae in cystic fibrosis (CF) is poorly understood. The pneumococcal population has changed over time after the introduction of the heptavalent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and, more recently, the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Although serotypes and clones causing invasive pneumococcal disease or colonizing healthy children have been extensively analysed, little is known so far on the serotypes and clones of pneumococci in CF patients. The aim of this work was to investigate serotypes, antibiotic susceptibilities, genotypes and biofilm production of CF pneumococcal isolates. Overall, 44 S. pneumoniae strains collected from 32 paediatric CF patients from January 2010 to May 2012 in a large Italian CF Centre were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by Etest, serotyped by the Quellung reaction and genotyped by a combination of different molecular typing methods, including pbp gene restriction profiling, pspA restriction profiling and sequencing, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Biofilm production by pneumococcal strains was also assessed. Penicillin non-susceptibility was 16 %. High resistance rates (>56 %) were observed for erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. The most frequent serotype recovered was serotype 3 (31.8 %). The coverage of PCV7 and PCV13 was 6.8 and 47.7 %, respectively. More than 80 % of CF strains belonged to Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) reference clones, the most common being Netherlands(3)-ST180 (28.2 %), and Greece(21)-30/ST193 (15.4 %). All strains produced biofilm in vitro, although with large variability in biofilm formation efficiency. No correlation was found between biofilm levels and serotype, clone or antibiotic resistance.

25336963	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: impact on the caregivers and families of patients	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) has a major impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of the affected children as well as their caregivers. The primary caregiver in the family is generally the mother, with support from the father and siblings. The burden of care and the effects of the disease on the child necessitate adjustments in virtually all aspects of the lives of their family. These adjustments inevitably affect the physical, emotional, social, and financial health of the whole family. Numerous sources of support for families can help to ease the burden of care. Improvements in the treatment of LGS, in addition to helping the child with LGS, would likely help improve the HRQL of the family members. This pilot parent survey was designed to explore the impact of epilepsy on caregiver HRQL. Parents of children with epilepsy who had contacted the Epilepsy Information Service at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, were sent questionnaires comprising open- and closed-ended questions. A total of 200 surveys were distributed, with a return rate of 48%. The results revealed that 74% of the parents believed that having a child with epilepsy brought them and their partner closer together. However, when the parents were asked to explain the manner in which epilepsy affected their families, answers included continuous stress, major financial distress, and lack of time to spend with other children. Information and resources for the families of children with LGS could help improve the HRQL of both the patients and their relatives.

25387861	Extracorporeal CO2 removal as bridge to lung transplantation in life-threatening hypercapnia	In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA®, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve®, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70-146) to 57 (45-64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06-7.28) to 7.39 (7.35-7.49), P < 0.0001.

THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		268	Extracorporeal CO2 removal as bridge to lung transplantation in life-threatening hypercapnia. In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA®, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve®, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70-146) to 57 (45-64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06-7.28) to 7.39 (7.35-7.49), P < 0.0001. Four patients were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to progressive hypoxia or circulatory failure. Nineteen patients (95%) were successfully transplanted.

25404599	Development of a community residency program with a focus on specialty pharmacy	An innovative community residency program that provides training in the clinical and administrative aspects of specialty pharmacy practice is described. An ongoing rapid rise in U.S. approvals of specialty therapies for chronic diseases and conditions (e.g., Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, infertility, hepatitis C infection, multiple sclerosis) is fueling demand for pharmacists trained to meet the complex needs of patients receiving those therapies, which are typically subject to risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) requirements and limited distribution arrangements. In 2011, Duquesne University Mylan School of Pharmacy partnered with Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy to launch a one-year community residency program designed to (1) provide enhanced education on diseases and conditions targeted by specialty therapies, (2) develop well-rounded clinicians who are fully knowledgeable of the medications used to treat those disorders, and (3) prepare trainees for the operational and business-related challenges of specialty pharmacy practice. The first half of the residency year emphasizes direct patient care experiences, with team-based rotations focusing on specific disease states and health conditions; the second half of the residency program emphasizes operational-administrative training in areas such as clinical program development, resource utilization review, REMS compliance, contracting, and navigating manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs. Other program components include a one-month external rotation at a managed care organization, research projects, and teaching experiences. A unique community residency program jointly developed by Duquesne University and Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy prepares trainees for careers in diverse clinical, managed care, community-based, and academic practice settings.	cystic fibrosis			290	Development of a community residency program with a focus on specialty pharmacy.

25445528	Sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanocarriers for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with cystic fibrosis	Lung impairment is the most life-threatening factor for cystic fibrosis patients. Indeed, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main pathogen in the pulmonary infection of these patients. **In this work, we developed sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanoparticles, namely, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), as a strategy to enhance the antimicrobial therapy against P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.** The nanoparticles obtained displayed a 200-400 nm size, high drug entrapment (79-94%) and a sustained drug release profile. Moreover, both SLN and NLC presented antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated P. aeruginosa. The integrity of the nanoparticles was not affected by nebulization through a mesh vibrating nebulizer. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles appeared to be less toxic than free sodium colistimethate in cell culture. Finally, an in vivo distribution experiment showed that nanoparticles spread homogenously through the lung and there was no migration of lipid nanoparticles to other organs, such as liver, spleen or kidneys.	cystic fibrosis	0.3.

25511520	Clinical considerations in transitioning patients with epilepsy from clonazepam to clobazam: a case series	In treating refractory epilepsy, many clinicians are interested in methods used to transition patients receiving clonazepam to clobazam to maintain or increase seizure control, improve tolerability of patients' overall drug therapy regimens, and to enhance quality of life for patients and their families. However, no published guidelines assist clinicians in successfully accomplishing this change safely. The following three case reports provide insight into the transition from clonazepam to clobazam. First, an 8-year-old Caucasian boy with cryptogenic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome beginning at 3.5 years of age, who was experiencing multiple daily generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and tonic seizures at presentation. Second, a 25-year-old, left-handed, White Hispanic man with moderate mental retardation and medically refractory seizures that he began experiencing at 1 year of age, secondary to tuberous sclerosis. When first presented to an epilepsy center, he had been receiving levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam, but reported having ongoing and frequent seizures. Third, a 69-year-old Korean woman who had been healthy until she had a stroke in 2009 with subsequent right hemiparesis; as a result, she became less physically and socially active, and had her first convulsive seizure approximately 4 months after the stroke. From these cases, we observe that a rough estimate of final clobazam dosage for each mg of clonazepam under substitution is likely to be at least 10-fold, probably closer to 15-fold for many patients, and as high as 20-fold for a few. Consideration and discussion of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and clinical properties of 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepine action provide a rationale on why and how these transitions were successful.

25512598	Modulation of CFTR gating by permeant ions	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is unique among ion channels in that after its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), its ATP-dependent gating violates microscopic reversibility caused by the intimate involvement of ATP hydrolysis in controlling channel closure. Recent studies suggest a gating model featuring an energetic coupling between opening and closing of the gate in CFTR's transmembrane domains and association and dissociation of its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). We found that permeant ions such as nitrate can increase the open probability (Po) of wild-type (WT) CFTR by increasing the opening rate and decreasing the closing rate. Nearly identical effects were seen with a construct in which activity does not require phosphorylation of the regulatory domain, indicating that nitrate primarily affects ATP-dependent gating steps rather than PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the effects of nitrate on CFTR gating are remarkably similar to those of VX-770 (N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide), a potent CFTR potentiator used in clinics. These include effects on single-channel kinetics of WT CFTR, deceleration of the nonhydrolytic closing rate, and potentiation of the Po of the disease-associated mutant G551D. In addition, both VX-770 and nitrate increased the activity of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 (ΔNBD2), indicating that these gating effects are independent of NBD dimerization. Nonetheless, whereas VX-770 is equally effective when applied from either side of the membrane, nitrate potentiates gating mainly from the cytoplasmic side, implicating a common mechanism for gating modulation mediated through two separate sites of action.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

25543221	Pulmonary arterial hypertension and portal hypertension in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease that could be inherited with an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations in BMPR2 gene are described in over 70% of cases, although other genes are involved in lesser extend in PAH. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is another rare autosomal dominant disease. PAH is a rare complication of HHT that occurs in less than 1% of cases. Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension is also associated with the presence of PAHs in 1-2% of cases. We present here a patient with HHT who developed PAH shortly after showing portal hypertension. Some genes (BMPR2, ACVRL1, ENG) seem to play an important role in PAH pathogenesis. We analyzed these genes, detecting mutations in BMPR2 gene (c.1021G>A (V341L), c.327G>A (p.Q109Q)), ACVRL1 (c.313+20C>A, c.1502+7A>G) and ENG (c.498G>A (Q166Q)). The patient also had 3 polymorphisms in the TRPC6 gene (c.1-361A>T, c.1-254C>G, c.1-218C>T). The study of these genes will help us to identify and track individuals susceptible for developing PAH associated with other diseases.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25619447	A granulocytosis associated with rufinamide: A case report	Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) chemically unrelated to other current AEDs. Previous studies on pediatric epilepsy treatment with rufinamide have demonstrated a frequency of leukopenia as an adverse event of 0.5%, and there has been no report of the development of agranulocytosis. Here, we report a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who developed agranulocytosis associated with fever and skin rash with rufinamide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of agranulocytosis induced by rufinamide. A 10-year-old boy with a history of herpes encephalitis at the age of 1 year developed LGS, and was administered rufinamide as add-on therapy to valproate, lamotrigine, and clonazepam because of difficulties in controlling tonic seizures. Eighteen days after initiation of rufinamide, agranulocytosis developed associated with high fever and skin rash, all of which resolved after withdrawal of rufinamide. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normocellular marrow with selective decrease of mature myeloid series, and suggested that agranulocytosis was not related to malignancy or serious infection. This case suggests that rufinamide may induce the potentially serious adverse effect of agranulocytosis. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs of agranulocytosis and consideration should be given to routine blood count determination for early detection of this.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

25681074	Factors impacting the growth and nutritional status of cystic fibrosis patients younger than 10 years of age who did not undergo neonatal screening	The aim of this study was to evaluate by clinical and laboratory parameters how cystic fibrosis (CF) affects growth and nutritional status of children who were undergoing CF treatment but did not receive newborn screening. A historical cohort study of 52 CF patients younger than 10 years of age were followed in a reference center in Campinas, Southeast Brazil. Anthropometric measurements were abstracted from medical records until March/2010, when neonatal screening program was implemented. Between September/2009 and March/2010, parental height of the 52 CF patients were also measured. Regarding nutritional status, four patients had Z-scores ≤ -2 for height/age (H/A) and body mass index/age (BMI/A). The following variables were associated with improved H/A ratio: fewer hospitalizations, longer time from first appointment to diagnosis, longer time from birth to diagnosis and later onset of respiratory disease. Forced vital capacity [FVC(%)], forced expiratory flow between 25-75% of FVC [FEF25-75(%)], forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1(%)], gestational age, birth weight and early respiratory symptoms were associated with IMC/A. Greater number of hospitalizations, diagnosis delay and early onset of respiratory disease had a negative impact on growth. Lower spirometric values, lower gestational age, lower birth weight, and early onset of respiratory symptoms had negative impact on nutritional status. Malnutrition was observed in 7.7% of cases, but 23% of children had nutritional risk.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

25725797	Investigation of the multifaceted iron acquisition strategies of Burkholderia cenocepacia	Burkholderia cenocepacia is a bacterial pathogen which causes severe respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). These studies were aimed at gaining an insight into the iron acquisition strategies of B. cenocepacia. In iron restricted conditions, genes associated with the synthesis and utilisation of ornibactin (pvdA, orbA, orb F) were significantly upregulated compared to the expression of pyochelin associated genes (pchD, fptA). In the absence of alternative iron sources, B. cenocepacia J2315 and 715j utilised ferritin and haemin, but not transferrin or lactoferrin for growth. Significantly, mutants unable to produce ornibactin, (715j-orbI) or ornibactin and pyochelin, (715j-pobA), utilised haemin and ferritin more efficiently than the wild-type. Moreover, both mutants were also able to utilise lactoferrin for growth (P ≤ 0.01) and additionally 715j-pobA utilised transferrin (P ≤ 0.01), potentially facilitating adaptation to the host environment. Furthermore, B. cenocepacia increased ornibactin gene expression in response to pyoverdine from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P ≤ 0.01), demonstrating the capacity to compete for iron in co-colonised niches. Pyoverdine also significantly diminished the growth of B. cenocepacia (P < 0.001) which was related to its iron chelating activity. In a study of three B. cenocepacia sequential clonal isolates obtained from a CF patient over a 3.5 year period, ornibactin upregulation in response to pyoverdine was less pronounced in the last isolate compared to the earlier isolates, as was growth in the presence of haemin and ferritin, indicating alternative iron acquisition mechanism(s) may dominate as chronic infection progresses. These data demonstrate the multifaceted iron acquisition strategies of B. cenocepacia and their capacity to be differentially activated in the presence of P. aeruginosa and during chronic infection.	cystic fibrosis	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		325	Investigation of the multifaceted iron acquisition strategies of Burkholderia cenocepacia. Burkholderia cenocepacia is a bacterial pathogen which causes severe respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). These studies were aimed at gaining an insight into the iron acquisition strategies of B. cenocepacia. In iron restricted conditions, genes associated with the synthesis and utilisation of ornibactin (pvdA, orbA, orb F) were significantly upregulated compared to the expression of pyochelin associated genes (pchD, fptA). In the absence of alternative iron sources, B. cenocepacia J2315 and 715j utilised ferritin and haemin, but not transferrin or lactoferrin for growth. Significantly, mutants unable to produce ornibactin, (715j-orbI) or ornibactin and pyochelin, (715j-pobA), utilised haemin and ferritin more efficiently than the wild-type. Moreover, both mutants were also able to utilise lactoferrin for growth (P ≤ 0.01) and additionally 715j-pobA utilised transferrin (P ≤ 0.01), potentially facilitating adaptation to the host environment. Furthermore, B. cenocepacia increased ornibactin gene expression in response to pyoverdine from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P ≤ 0.01), demonstrating the capacity to compete for iron in co-colonised niches. Pyoverdine also significantly diminished the growth of B. cenocepacia (P < 0.001) which was related to its iron chelating activity. In a study of three B. cenocepacia sequential clonal isolates obtained from a CF patient over a 3.5 year period, ornibactin upregulation in response to pyoverdine was less pronounced in the last isolate compared to the earlier isolates, as was growth in the presence of haemin and ferritin, indicating alternative iron acquisition mechanism(s) may dominate as chronic infection progresses.

25730374	Effectiveness and tolerability of perampanel in children and adolescents with refractory epilepsies: first experiences	This article aims to report the first clinical experiences concerning effectiveness and tolerability of perampanel (PER) in a pediatric population with refractory epilepsies. **This nonsponsored, observational, retrospective survey was conducted through collaboration with multiple centers in Europe.** The clinical course of the first pediatric patients treated in these centers with PER was documented with the help of a questionnaire completed by the treating physicians. Effectiveness and adverse effects were evaluated. The study population consisted of 58 patients (mean age, 10.5 years; range, 2-17 years), suffering from various refractory epilepsies, classified as focal epilepsy (n = 36), unclassified generalized epilepsy (n = 12), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 5), West syndrome (n = 3), and Dravet syndrome (n = 2). The response rate (≥ 50% seizure reduction) after the first 3 months of therapy was 31% (18/58 patients) in total. Complete seizure control was achieved in five patients (9% overall). Aggravation of seizures occurred in five cases (9%). The most frequently occurring adverse effects were reduced vigilance or fatigue (n = 16) and behavioral changes (n = 14). PER seems to be effective also in children and adolescents with pharmaco-refractory epilepsies. Tolerability was acceptable.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

25742660	Rapid detection and immune characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in cystic fibrosis patients	Cystic fibrosis patients are highly susceptible to infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Especially Mycobacterium abscessus infections are common but reliable diagnosis is hampered by non-specific clinical symptoms and insensitive mycobacterial culture. In the present study we established novel methods for rapid detection and immune characterization of Mycobacterium abscessus infection in cystic fibrosis patients. We performed Mycobacterium abscessus specific DNA-strip- and quantitative PCR-based analyses of non-cultured sputum samples to detect and characterize Mycobacterium abscessus infections. Concomitantly in vitro T-cell reactivation with purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from different mycobacterial species was used to determine Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cell cytokine expression of infected cystic fibrosis patients. Four of 35 cystic fibrosis patients (11.4%) were Mycobacterium abscessus culture positive and showed concordant DNA-strip-test results. Quantitative PCR revealed marked differences of mycobacterial burden between cystic fibrosis patients and during disease course. Tandem-repeat analysis classified distinct Mycobacterium abscessus strains of infected cystic fibrosis patients and excluded patient-to-patient transmission. Mycobacterium abscessus specific T-cells were detected in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients with confirmed chronic infection and a subgroup of patients without evidence of Mycobacterium abscessus infection. Comparison of cytokine expression and phenotypic markers revealed increased proportions of CD40L positive T-cells that lack Interleukin-2 expression as a marker for chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Direct sputum examination enabled rapid diagnosis and quantification of Mycobacterium abscessus in cystic fibrosis patients. T-cell in vitro reactivation and cytokine expression analyses may contribute to diagnosis of chronic Mycobacterium abscessus infection.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

25763011	Contribution of oxidative stress to endothelial dysfunction in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Our studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, a vascular dysplasia affecting 1 in 5,000-8,000 people. Mutations in endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes are responsible for HHT1 and HHT2 and are associated with arteriovenous malformations. ENG and ACVRL1 interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and regulate its activation. Mice heterozygous for these genes (Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-)) show reduced ENG or ACVRL1 protein levels in endothelial cells causing eNOS uncoupling, generation of ROS rather than nitric oxide (NO•), leading to impaired NO• mediated vasodilation. ROS production is increased in several organs of Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice, including lungs, liver, and colon, affected in HHT. The major source of increased oxidative stress in these tissues is eNOS-derived ROS and not mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS. Eng (+/-) and Acvrl1 (+/-) mice also develop with age signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to eNOS-derived ROS, which was preventable by antioxidant treatment. To date, only one pilot study has been carried out in HHT patients, and it showed beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy on epistaxis. We suggest that more clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether antioxidants would prevent, delay or attenuate manifestations of disease in individuals with HHT, based on our experimental data in mouse models.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25781545	Validation of CFTR intronic variants identified during cystic fibrosis population screening by a minigene splicing assay	Cystic fibrosis, caused by mutations of the CFTR gene, is the most common autosomal recessive condition in the European population and there are specific screening programs aimed at investigating healthy carriers. They are usually articulated in two steps: initially individuals are screened with a panel of the 20-50 most common CFTR mutations; the second step is offered to partners of carriers who were found negative at the first test and consists in the analysis of the entire CFTR gene. This strategy provides high sensitivity, however, it often identifies novel variants (especially in introns) of unknown significance. Establishing the pathogenicity of these variants of the CFTR gene is not a simple task. We have examined five CFTR intronic variants of unclear significance (c.274-6T>C, c.744-6T>G, c.1117-64G>A, c.2620-26A>G, and c.3468+51C>A) using a functional splicing assay based on hybrid minigenes. Four out of five variants (including c.2620-26A>G which was previously reported as a possible splice-site mutation) did not alter the correct splicing of the minigene and are likely to be neutral polymorphisms, whereas c.744-6T>G caused complete skipping of CFTR exon 7 and should be therefore regarded as a pathogenic CFTR mutation. Hybrid minigenes assay are a simple and rapid tool to evaluate the effects of intronic variants without the need of analyzing patient's mRNA, and are particularly suited to analyze variants identified during population screenings.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

25798598	Functional characterization of the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam and its major active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam at human GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes	The 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older in the United States, and for treatment of anxiety and various forms of epilepsy elsewhere. Clobazam has been reported to exhibit different in vivo adverse effects and addiction liability profile than the classic 1,4-benzodiazepines.** In this study, it was investigated whether the in vitro pharmacological properties of clobazam and its major active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam could explain some of these clinical differences. **The functional properties of the two 1,5-benzodiazepines were characterized at the human γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) subtypes α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S), α5β2γ(2S) and α6β2δ expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by use of two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology and compared to those exhibited by the 1,4-benzodiazepine clonazepam. All three compounds potentiated GABA EC20-evoked responses through the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, with each displaying similar EC50 values at the four subtypes. Furthermore, the degrees of potentiation of the GABA EC20 currents through the four receptors mediated by saturating modulator concentrations did not differ substantially for any of the three benzodiazepines. The three compounds were substantially less potent (200-3900 fold) as positive allosteric modulators at the α6β2δ GABA(A)R than at the α(1,2,3,5)β2γ(2S) receptors. Interestingly, however, clobazam and especially N-desmethylclobazam were highly efficacious potentiators of α6β2δ receptor signaling. Although this activity component is unlikely to contribute to the in vivo effects of clobazam/N-desmethylclobazam, the 1,5-benzodiazepine could constitute an interesting lead for novel modulators targeting this low-affinity binding site in GABAARs. In conclusion, the non-selective modulation exerted by clobazam, N-desmethylclobazam and clonazepam at the α1β2γ(2S), α2β2γ(2S), α3β2γ(2S) and α5β2γ(2S) GABA(A)Rs indicate that the observed clinical differences between clobazam and 1,4-benzodiazepines are likely to arise from factors other than their respective pharmacological properties at the GABA(A)Rs as investigated here.

25815003	Genetic variation in the functional ENG allele inherited from the non-affected parent associates with presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 (HHT1) and may influence expression of PTPN14	HHT shows clinical variability within and between families. Organ site and prevalence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depend on the HHT causative gene and on environmental and genetic modifiers. We tested whether variation in the functional ENG allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, alters risk for pulmonary AVM in HHT1 mutation carriers who are ENG haploinsufficient. Genetic association was found between rs10987746 of the wild type ENG allele and presence of pulmonary AVM [relative risk = 1.3 (1.0018-1.7424)]. The rs10987746-C at-risk allele associated with lower expression of ENG RNA in a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.004). Moreover, in angiogenically active human lung adenocarcinoma tissue, but not in uninvolved quiescent lung, rs10987746-C was correlated with expression of PTPN14 (P = 0.004), another modifier of HHT. Quantitative TAQMAN expression analysis in a panel of normal lung tissues from 69 genetically heterogeneous inter-specific backcross mice, demonstrated strong correlation between expression levels of Eng, Acvrl1, and Ptpn14 (r2 = 0.75-0.9, P < 1 × 10(-12)), further suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between these three genes in lung in vivo. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the single functional ENG gene influences quantitative and/or qualitative differences in ENG expression that contribute to risk of pulmonary AVM in HHT1, and provide correlative support for PTPN14 involvement in endoglin/ALK1 lung biology in vivo. PTPN14 has been shown to be a negative regulator of Yap/Taz signaling, which is implicated in mechanotransduction, providing a possible molecular link between endoglin/ALK1 signaling and mechanical stress. EMILIN2, which showed suggestive genetic association with pulmonary AVM, is also reported to interact with Taz in angiogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these interactions in endothelial cells may ultimately provide more rational choices for HHT therapy.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25825042	Genetic and Phenotypic Characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from Cystic Fibrosis Patients in Austria	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting inherited disease in Caucasian populations. While pathological changes can be seen in various organs, morbidity and mortality are mainly related to the respiratory tract, with patients suffering from chronic bronchopulmonary infections with characteristic pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus. To date, there is only very limited data on the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of S. aureus in CF patients. Therefore, in our study, we characterized 58 S. aureus isolates collected from CF patients in Austria by spa typing, DNA microarray profiling, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility testing in order to determine common genomic and antimicrobial resistance features. The tested strain collection exhibited high genomic diversity. The 58 isolates were assigned to 16 clonal complexes and 48 spa types and differed greatly regarding their virulence and resistance gene profiles. The predominant clonal complexes were MLST CC30 (22%), CC15 (16%), CC45 (14%), and CC5 (12%), complexes that are highly prevalent worldwide among S. aureus strains isolated from humans colonized or infected with S. aureus. DNA microarray profiles showed a wide variety of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors such as various leukocidins, haemolysins, enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin, as well as genes involved in adhesion and immune evasion. While a large number of strains exhibited resistance to one or several antimicrobial agents, methicillin-resistant S. aureus was found at a low prevalence of 3% (n = 2) only. The two methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were assigned to CC152/t355 (SCCmecV) and CC5/t001 (SCCmecI).

25845492	Parental reporting of response to oral cannabis extracts for treatment of refractory epilepsy	Oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) have been used in the treatment of epilepsy; however, no studies demonstrate clear efficacy. We report on a cohort of pediatric patients with epilepsy who were given OCE and followed in a single tertiary epilepsy center. A retrospective chart review of children and adolescents who were given OCE for treatment of their epilepsy was performed. Seventy-five patients were identified of which 57% reported any improvement in seizure control and 33% reported a >50% reduction in seizures (responders). If the family had moved to CO for OCE treatment, the responder rate was 47% vs. 22% for children who already were in CO. The responder rate varied based on epilepsy syndrome: Dravet 23%, Doose 0%, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 88.9%. The background EEG of the 8 responders where EEG data were available was not improved. Additional benefits reported included: improved behavior/alertness (33%), improved language (10%), and improved motor skills (10%). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% of patients including increased seizures (13%) and somnolence/fatigue (12%). Rare adverse events included developmental regression, abnormal movements, status epilepticus requiring intubation, and death. Our retrospective study of OCE use in pediatric patients with epilepsy demonstrates that some families reported patient improvement with treatment; however, we also found a variety of challenges and possible confounding factors in studying OCE retrospectively in an open-labeled fashion. We strongly support the need for controlled, blinded studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCE for treatment of pediatric epilepsies using accurate seizure counts, formal neurocognitive assessments, as well as EEG as a biomarker. This study provides Class III evidence that OCE is well tolerated by children and adolescents with epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		351	Parental reporting of response to oral cannabis extracts for treatment of refractory epilepsy. Oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) have been used in the treatment of epilepsy; however, no studies demonstrate clear efficacy. We report on a cohort of pediatric patients with epilepsy who were given OCE and followed in a single tertiary epilepsy center. A retrospective chart review of children and adolescents who were given OCE for treatment of their epilepsy was performed. Seventy-five patients were identified of which 57% reported any improvement in seizure control and 33% reported a >50% reduction in seizures (responders). If the family had moved to CO for OCE treatment, the responder rate was 47% vs. 22% for children who already were in CO. The responder rate varied based on epilepsy syndrome: Dravet 23%, Doose 0%, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) 88.9%. The background EEG of the 8 responders where EEG data were available was not improved. Additional benefits reported included: improved behavior/alertness (33%), improved language (10%), and improved motor skills (10%). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% of patients including increased seizures (13%) and somnolence/fatigue (12%). Rare adverse events included developmental regression, abnormal movements, status epilepticus requiring intubation, and death. Our retrospective study of OCE use in pediatric patients with epilepsy demonstrates that some families reported patient improvement with treatment; however, we also found a variety of challenges and possible confounding factors in studying OCE retrospectively in an open-labeled fashion. We strongly support the need for controlled, blinded studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCE for treatment of pediatric epilepsies using accurate seizure counts, formal neurocognitive assessments, as well as EEG as a biomarker. This study provides Class III evidence that OCE is well tolerated by children and adolescents with epilepsy.
25847334	Retention rates of rufinamide in pediatric epilepsy patients with and without Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome	To evaluate the effectiveness of rufinamide (RFM) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) compared to those with other epilepsy syndromes using time to treatment failure (retention rate) as the outcome measure. In this retrospective cohort study, characteristics and outcomes of all patients receiving RFM in 2009 and 2010 were recorded. The primary outcome measure was RFM failure, defined as discontinuation of RFM or initiation of an additional antiepileptic therapy. The secondary outcome measure was discontinuation of RFM. Kaplan-Meier method survival curves were generated for time to RFM failure, for all patients and by the presence or absence of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The impact of age, seizure type, fast or slow drug titration, and concomitant therapy with valproate on retention rate were evaluated using Cox regression models. One hundred thirty-three patients were included, 39 (30%) of whom had LGS. For all patients, the probability of remaining on RFM without additional therapy was 45% at 12 months and 30% at 24 months. LGS diagnosis was an independent predictor of time to RFM failure (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.83), with a median time to failure of 18 months in LGS compared to 6 months in all others (p=0.006). In a broad population of children with refractory epilepsy, around half will continue taking the medication for at least a year without additional therapy. Patients with LGS are two times more likely to continue RFM without additional therapy compared to those without LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

25862798	Complications and mortality in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A population-based study	Studies report that the risks of significant neurologic complications (including stroke, cerebral abscess, and migraine) and hemorrhagic sequelae are high in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), and that life expectancy in this cohort is reduced. However, most published cohorts derive from specialist centers, which may be susceptible to bias. We used a population-based approach to estimate the risks of developing neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of HHT, the association of a diagnosis of HHT with common cardiovascular and malignant comorbidities, and also long-term survival of those with the disease. From a UK primary care database of 3.5 million patients (The Health Improvement Network), we identified 675 cases with a diagnosis of HHT and compared them with 6,696 controls matched by age, sex, and primary care practice. Risks of stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6), cerebral abscess (OR 30.0, CI 3.1-288), and migraine (OR 1.7, CI 1.3-2.2) were elevated over controls. Bleeding complications including epistaxis (OR 11.6, CI 9.1-14.7) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 6.1, CI 2.8-13.4) were more common in cases with HHT. Survival of cases with HHT was poorer than controls with a hazard ratio for death of 2.0 (CI 1.6-2.6) and a median age at death 3 years younger. Patients with HHT are at substantially increased risk of serious neurologic and hemorrhagic complications of the disease. Because a diagnosis of HHT is associated with a significantly poorer survival compared with those who have no disease, evaluation of new strategies to improve clinical management is required.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

25869324	Use of ibuprofen to assess inflammatory biomarkers in induced sputum: Implications for clinical trials in cystic fibrosis	High-dose ibuprofen (HDI) is a clinically beneficial anti-inflammatory regimen that may be a useful reagent to study induced sputum inflammatory marker changes over short study periods appropriate for early-phase CF clinical trials. We conducted a 28-day, open-label, randomized, controlled trial among 72 clinically stable CF subjects (FEV1≥40% predicted) randomized to HDI or routine care that assessed IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1-β, free neutrophil elastase, and white cell counts with differentials change from baseline in induced sputum. IL-6 was the only biomarker with significant within-group change: 0.13 log10 pg/mL mean reduction among ibuprofen-treated subjects (p=0.04); and no change in the control group. IL-6 change between groups was statistically significant (p=0.024). No other inflammatory biomarker differences were observed between groups after 28 days. Although we studied only one agent, HDI, these results suggest that one month may be inadequate to assess anti-inflammatory candidates using markers from induced sputum.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

25884905	Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37 Is Both a Substrate of Cathepsins S and K and a Selective Inhibitor of Cathepsin L	Lung cysteine cathepsins B, K, L, and S contribute to physiological and pathological processes including degradation of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) such as surfactant protein SP-A, lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, and beta-defensins-2 and -3. **Substantial amounts of uncleaved LL-37, a 37-mer cationic AMP, were observed in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)**. Nevertheless LL-37 was degraded after prolonged incubation in CF sputum, and the hydrolysis was blocked by E-64, a selective inhibitor of cysteine proteases. Cathepsins K and S, expressed in human alveolar macrophages, thoroughly hydrolyzed LL-37 in vitro, whereas it competitively inhibited cathepsin L (Ki = 150 nM). Cleavage of LL-37 by cathepsins S and K impaired its antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The exchange of residues 67 and 205 in the S2 pockets of cathepsins L (Leu67Tyr/Ala205Leu) and K (Tyr67Leu/Leu205Ala) switched the specificity of these mutants toward LL-37. Molecular modeling suggested that LL-37 interacted with the active site of cathepsin L in both forward (i.e., substrate-like) and reverse orientations with similar binding energies. **Our data support the hypothesis that cysteine cathepsins modulate the innate immunity response by degrading distinct and representative members of the AMP family.**	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

25909848	BMP9 Crosstalk with the Hippo Pathway Regulates Endothelial Cell Matricellular and Chemokine Responses	Endoglin is a type III TGFβ auxiliary receptor that is upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and, when mutated in humans, results in the vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Though endoglin has been implicated in cell adhesion, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show endoglin expression in endothelial cells regulates subcellular localization of zyxin in focal adhesions in response to BMP9. RNA knockdown of endoglin resulted in mislocalization of zyxin and altered formation of focal adhesions. The mechanotransduction role of focal adhesions and their ability to transmit regulatory signals through binding of the extracellular matrix are altered by endoglin deficiency. BMP/TGFβ transcription factors, SMADs, and zyxin have recently been implicated in a newly emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo pathway. The Hippo transcription coactivator, YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1), has been suggested to play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and cell-cell contact. Identification of BMP9-dependent nuclear localization of YAP1 in response to endoglin expression suggests a mechanism of crosstalk between the two pathways. Suppression of endoglin and YAP1 alters BMP9-dependent expression of YAP1 target genes CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) as well as the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1). These results suggest a coordinate effect of endoglin deficiency on cell matrix remodeling and local inflammatory responses. Identification of a direct link between the Hippo pathway and endoglin may reveal novel mechanisms in the etiology of HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25935511	Perceived efficacy of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis extracts for treatment of pediatric epilepsy: A potential role for infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	There is a great need for safe and effective therapies for treatment of infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Based on anecdotal reports and limited experience in an open-label trial, cannabidiol (CBD) has received tremendous attention as a potential treatment for pediatric epilepsy, especially Dravet syndrome. However, there is scant evidence of specific utility for treatment of IS and LGS. W**e sought to document the experiences of children with IS and/or LGS who have been treated with CBD-enriched cannabis preparations.** We conducted a brief online survey of parents who administered CBD-enriched cannabis preparations for the treatment of their children's epilepsy. We specifically recruited parents of children with IS and LGS and focused on perceived efficacy, dosage, and tolerability. Survey respondents included 117 parents of children with epilepsy (including 53 with IS or LGS) who had administered CBD products to their children. Perceived efficacy and tolerability were similar across etiologic subgroups. Eighty-five percent of all parents reported a reduction in seizure frequency, and 14% reported complete seizure freedom. Epilepsy was characterized as highly refractory with median latency from epilepsy onset to CBD initiation of five years, during which the patient's seizures failed to improve after a median of eight antiseizure medication trials. The median duration and the median dosage of CBD exposure were 6.8 months and 4.3mg/kg/day, respectively. Reported side effects were far less common during CBD exposure, with the exception of increased appetite (30%). A high proportion of respondents reported improvement in sleep (53%), alertness (71%), and mood (63%) during CBD therapy. Although this study suggests a potential role for CBD in the treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy including IS and LGS, it does not represent compelling evidence of efficacy or safety. From a methodological standpoint, this study is extraordinarily vulnerable to participation bias and limited by lack of blinded outcome ascertainment. Appropriately controlled clinical trials are essential to establish efficacy and safety.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

25940107	Clobazam is equally safe and efficacious for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome across different age groups: Post hoc analyses of short- and long-term clinical trial results	The peak age at onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is between 3 and 5years. Patients with LGS frequently experience multiple types of treatment-refractory seizures and require lifelong therapy with several antiepileptic drugs. Here, post hoc analyses of clinical trials (phase III trial OV-1012 and open-label extension trial OV-1004) provide short- and long-term efficacy and safety data of adjunctive clobazam in patients with LGS stratified by age at baseline (≥2 to <12years, ≥12 to <17years, and ≥17years). In OV-1012, 301 patients were screened, 238 were randomized, 217 comprised the modified intention-to-treat population, and 177 completed the study. A total of 267/306 patients (61 of 68 from phase II trial OV-1002 and 206 of 238 from phase III trial OV-1012) entered the open-label extension trial. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between different age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. No differences in efficacy or adverse events were observed across age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. The results of these post hoc analyses show that adjunctive clobazam over the short and longterm was similarly effective and well-tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients with LGS.

25940942	Prevalence and nature of dyspnea in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder associated with pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), present in about 30-50% of patients. Dyspnea is frequently reported by about one-half of patients with PAVMs and has been related to the degree of right to left shunting. However, many HHT patients with PAVMs remain asymptomatic and those without PAVMs have been observed to have dyspnea, the cause of which has not been characterized. The study objectives were to determine the prevalence of dyspnea and its etiology in the HHT population. Retrospective review of over 1000 patients at an HHT Center of Excellence from 1997 to 2010. Patients were categorized as definite HHT if they met ≥3 clinical diagnostic criteria or had a positive genetic diagnosis. Patients were unlikely to have HHT (non-HHT) if they had 1 or fewer diagnostic criteria. Data on dyspnea prevalence (MMRC ≥ 1), PAVMs, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, symptomatic liver venous malformations, anemia and obesity was reviewed. 506 patients were categorized as having HHT, of which 202 (40%) had confirmed PAVMs. Dyspnea prevalence was 35% (178/506) vs. 18% (50/284, p < 0.0001) in the HHT and non-HHT patients, respectively. With multivariable logistic regression, the odds of dyspnea (MMRC ≥1) was 3.45 (95% CI 2.08-5.71) with the presence of PAVMs in HHT patients. Other independent predictors of dyspnea were older age, underlying cardio-pulmonary disease, anemia, and obesity. Prevalence of dyspnea is significant, evident in about one-third of HHT patients, often associated with PAVMs. It is important to consider other etiologies for dyspnea when assessing patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

25970827	Mutation analysis in Norwegian families with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: founder mutations in ACVRL1	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease defined by the presence of epistaxis and mucocutaneous telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in internal organs. In most families (~85%), HHT is caused by mutations in the ENG (HHT1) or the ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes. Here, we report the results of genetic testing of 113 Norwegian families with suspected or definite HHT. **Variants in ENG and ACVRL1 were found in 105 families (42 ENG, 63 ACVRL1), including six novel variants of uncertain pathogenic significance**. Mutation types were similar to previous reports with more missense variants in ACVRL1 and more nonsense, frameshift and splice-site mutations in ENG. Thirty-two variants were novel in this study. The preponderance of ACVRL1 mutations was due to founder mutations, specifically, c.830C>A (p.Thr277Lys), which was found in 24 families from the same geographical area of Norway. We discuss the importance of founder mutations and present a thorough evaluation of missense and splice-site variants.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25981877	Metformin as possible therapy of pulmonary arterio venous malformation in HHT patients	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is an autosomic dominant disorder, which is characterized by the development of multiple arteriovenous malformations. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may either rupture or be responsible for a right-to-left shunting leading to paradoxical embolism causing stroke or cerebral abscess. Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			200	Metformin as possible therapy of pulmonary arterio venous malformation in HHT patients.

Metformin may harbor a pleiotropic action, (a) decreasing inflammation (via anti COX 2 pathway and other mechanism), (b) decreasing COX 2 and VEGF mediated angiogenesis, (c) increasing negative angiogenic regulation pathway by stimulating SMAD 2/3 expression either directly or via the AMPK pathway and preventing from pulmonary hypertension development and (d) diminushin oxidative stress. An animal model could be experimented to show its effects on PAVM formation. Metformin could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a diffuse HHT type with tiny PAVM. Metformin may be indicated as a prophylactic or curative therapy in HHT patients presenting with initial lung involvement. Metformin may be proposed to prevent from pulmonary arteriovenous malformation development and subsequent related complications.
26024338	The Fifth Transmembrane Segment of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Contributes to Its Anion Permeation Pathway	Previous studies have identified several transmembrane segments (TMs), including TM1, TM3, TM6, TM9, TM11, and TM12, as pore-lining segments in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), but the role of TM5 in pore construction remains controversial. In this study, we employed substituted cysteine accessibility methodology (SCAM) to screen the entire TM5 defined by the original topology model and its cytoplasmic extension in a Cysless background. We found six positions (A299, R303, N306, S307, F310, and F311) where engineered cysteines react to intracellular 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES⁻). Quantification of the modification rate of engineered cysteines in the presence or absence of ATP suggests that these six residues are accessible in both the open and closed states. Whole-cell experiments with external MTSES⁻ identified only two positive positions (L323 and A326), resulting in a segment containing 11 consecutive amino acids, where substituted cysteines respond to neither internal nor external MTSES⁻, a unique feature not seen previously in CFTR's pore-lining segments. The observation that these positions are inaccessible to channel-permeant thiol-specific reagent [Au(CN)₂]⁻ suggests that this segment of TM5 between F311 and L323 is concealed from the pore by other TMs and/or lipid bilayers. In addition, our data support the idea that the positively charged arginine at position 303 poses a pure electrostatic action in determining the single-channel current amplitude of CFTR and the effect of an open-channel blocker glibencalmide. Collectively, we conclude that the cytoplasmic portion of CFTR's TM5 lines the pore. Our functional data are remarkably consistent with predicted structural arrangements of TM5 in some homology models of CFTR.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26057351	The ketogenic diet can be used successfully in combination with corticosteroids for epileptic encephalopathies	Hormonal therapy or ketogenic diet often permits overcoming the challenging periods of many epileptic encephalopathies (West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep), but relapse affects over 20% of patients. W**e report here a monocenter pilot series of 42 consecutive patients in whom we combined oral steroids with the ketogenic diet for corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent epileptic encephalopathy. **We **_retrospectively_** evaluated the effect on seizure frequency, interictal spike activity, neuropsychological course, and steroid treatment course. Twenty-three patients had West syndrome (WS), 13 had encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves in slow sleep (CSWS), and six others had miscellaneous epileptic encephalopathies. All patients succeeded to reach 0.8 to 1.6g/l ketone bodies in the urine following the usual KD regimen. For at least 6 months, 14/42 responded to the addition of the ketogenic diet: 4/23 with WS, 8/13 with CSWS, and 2/6 with miscellaneous epileptic encephalopathies. The addition of the KD allowed withdrawing steroids in all responders. Among them, 10/15 had been patients with steroid-dependent epileptic encephalopathy and 4/27 patients with steroid-resistant epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, the ketogenic diet can be used successfully in combination with corticosteroids for epileptic encephalopathies. Patients presenting with steroid-dependent CSWS seem to be the best candidates.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

26068938	Copy number variant analysis from exome data in 349 patients with epileptic encephalopathy	Infantile spasms (IS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) are epileptic encephalopathies characterized by early onset, intractable seizures, and poor developmental outcomes. De novo sequence mutations and copy number variants (CNVs) are causative in a subset of cases. We used exome sequence data in 349 trios with IS or LGS to identify putative de novo CNVs. We confirm 18 de novo CNVs in 17 patients (4.8%), 10 of which are likely pathogenic, giving a firm genetic diagnosis for 2.9% of patients. Confirmation of exome-predicted CNVs by array-based methods is still required due to false-positive rates of prediction algorithms. Our exome-based results are consistent with recent array-based studies in similar cohorts and highlight novel candidate genes for IS and LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

Early diagnosis is important to avoid complications from vascular lesions, but diagnosis is difficult in asymptomatic patients. A 69-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of hepatic vascular malformations. He had mild anemia with iron deficiency, and dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant arteriovenous and arterioportal shunts throughout the liver. Telangiectasia from the pharynx to the duodenum was confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient history revealed episodes of epistaxis as well as a family history of epistaxis. He was diagnosed with HHT, although no other family member had been diagnosed with definite HHT. A diagnosis of HHT must be considered in patients with hepatic vascular malformations.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

LGS covers 5-10% of epileptic patients and 1-2% of childhood epilepsies. Also referred to as cryptogenic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy. LGS is characterized by: multiple seizures (atypical absences, axial tonic seizures and sudden atonic or myoclonic falls), diffuse slow cryptic EEG waves when awake (<3 Hz), fast rhythmic peaks (10 Hz) during sleep, mental retardation and personality disorders. The LGS is not responding to treatment. Some new drugs have proven to be effective in controlling the disease (Felbamate, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Levetiracetam). The mortality rate is about 5%; only rarely death is due to epilepsy, which is usually caused by stroke or epileptic episodes.** Here we describe the case of a 45-year-old female patient with LGS, severe hypokalemia, mental retardation and focal seizures. Normal renal function: creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, urea 26 mg/dl, creatinine clearance 96 ml/min, serum potassium levels to the minimum: 3.5 mEq/L. **This level of potassium, however, had been achieved with the assumption of 8 oral tablets/day of _potassium chloride_.

26093634	Clinical outcomes associated with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections in adult cystic fibrosis patients	Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the most prevalent organism infecting the respiratory tract of CF children, and remains the second most prevalent organism in CF adults. During early childhood, SA infections are associated with pulmonary inflammation and decline in FEV1, but their clinical significance in adult CF patients is poorly characterized. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to determine the association between airway microbiology and clinical outcomes (FEV1, rate of pulmonary exacerbations, CRP levels and clinical scores). In a cohort of 84 adult CF patients, 24 % were infected with SA only, 60 % were infected with PA, and 16 % had neither PA nor SA. CF patients with SA experienced fewer pulmonary exacerbations and lower CRP levels than those with PA. In adult CF patients, SA infections alone, in the absence of PA, are a marker of milder disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

26121472	Upregulation of TMEM16A Protein in Bronchial Epithelial Cells by Bacterial Pyocyanin	Induction of mucus hypersecretion in the airway epithelium by Th2 cytokines is associated with the expression of TMEM16A, a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel. We asked whether exposure of airway epithelial cells to bacterial components, a condition that mimics the highly infected environment occurring in cystic fibrosis (CF), also results in a similar response. In cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, treatment with pyocyanin or with a P. aeruginosa culture supernatant caused a significant increase in TMEM16A function. The Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion, triggered by stimulation with UTP, was particularly enhanced by pyocyanin in cells from CF patients. Increased expression of TMEM16A protein and of MUC5AC mucin by bacterial components was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in CF and non-CF cells. We also investigated TMEM16A expression in human bronchi by immunocytochemistry. We found increased TMEM16A staining in the airways of CF patients. The strongest signal was observed in CF submucosal glands. Our results suggest that TMEM16A expression/function is upregulated in CF lung disease, possibly as a response towards the presence of bacteria in the airways.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

T**hirty-one children with LGS were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups:** One group with the perinatal event and other group without evidence of the perinatal event. We hypothesized that LGS with the perinatal event will have an early age of onset of LGS, more motor deficits and abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and more severe epilepsy. There were 17 children in the perinatal event group and 14 in the other group. The mean age of onset of illness was significantly earlier in the perinatal event group (P < 0.05). More children in the perinatal event group had delayed milestones (P < 0.05), had higher seizure frequency (P < 0.05) however; there was no significant difference in number of anti-epileptic drugs consumed, motor deficits or MRI abnormalities. LGS children with the perinatal event have more severe epilepsy with early onset of disease and delayed milestones. History of perinatal insult in these children may help in predicting prognosis in LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

26171128	Anomalies of Pulmonary Circulation as a Cause of Hemoptysis: A Series of Unusual Cases and Review of the Literature	The expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract, called hemoptysis, is a common clinical condition with many potential etiologies. Massive hemoptysis is life threatening and needs urgent intervention. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a useful non-invasive imaging modality for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. Using MDCT with multiplanar reformatted images has improved the diagnosis and management of hemoptysis by providing a more precise depiction of bronchial and non-bronchial systemic arteries than conventional computed tomography (CT). In 95% of hemoptysis cases, the systemic arterial system is the origin of bleeding and pulmonary vascular anomalies are a rare cause. Among these, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and Osler-Weber-Rendu disease are well known entities. However, primary anomalies affecting pulmonary vessels in the mediastinum or diseases secondarily affecting the pulmonary vessels are unusual causes. Here we present three cases where patients had pulmonary vascular anomalies causing hemoptysis. These patients had decreased pulmonary arterial pressures leading to bronchial and systemic arterial hypertrophy and development of bronchopulmonary collaterals. Secondary CT signs in the parenchyma and mediastinum (mosaic attenuation, ground glass haze, subpleural interstitial thickening, and hypertrophied bronchial arteries) were similar in all patients. Hence, evaluation of the MDCT images for primary abnormality led to the diagnosis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Treatment with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may increase aggression/behavioral problems in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Post hoc analyses of data from the OV-1012 trial assessed the potential for behavioral effects with clobazam treatment in pediatric (2 to 18 years) patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. **OV-1012 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial comprising a 4-week baseline period, 3-week titration period, and a 12-week maintenance period. **Data from 194 patients were analyzed for a history of aggression/behavioral problems, occurrence of aggression-related adverse events, and by assessment of potential drug-related effects on four behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist. Twenty-nine aggression-related adverse events were reported for 27 (13.9%) patients. Similar percentages of clobazam-treated patients with and without a history of aggressive behavior experienced an aggression-related adverse event (16.7% versus 15.5%, respectively). In the medium- and high-dosage clobazam groups, onset of aggression-related adverse effects occurred within the 3-week titration period with 63.2% resolving by the end of the study. Aggression-related adverse event onset and resolution were similar for the low-dosage clobazam and placebo groups. Analysis of baseline to postbaseline T scores for the behavior domains of the Child Behavior Checklist indicated no significant differences between clobazam and placebo. Post hoc analyses indicate that the overall rate of aggression with clobazam treatment was low and dosage dependent.

26333833	Brain regions with abnormal network properties in severe epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut phenotype: Multivariate analysis of task-free fMRI	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and the similar but less tightly defined Lennox-Gastaut phenotype, describe patients with severe epilepsy, generalized epileptic discharges, and variable intellectual disability. Our previous functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal diffuse association network activity underlies the epileptic discharges of this clinical phenotype. Herein we use a data-driven multivariate approach to determine the spatial changes in local and global networks of patients with severe epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut phenotype. We studied 9 adult patients and 14 controls. In 20 min of task-free blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data, two metrics of functional connectivity were studied: Regional homogeneity or local connectivity, a measure of concordance between each voxel to a focal cluster of adjacent voxels; and eigenvector centrality, a global connectivity estimate designed to detect important neural hubs. Multivariate pattern analysis of these data in a machine-learning framework was used to identify spatial features that classified disease subjects. Multivariate pattern analysis was 95.7% accurate in classifying subjects for both local and global connectivity measures (22/23 subjects correctly classified). Maximal discriminating features were the following: increased local connectivity in frontoinsular and intraparietal areas; increased global connectivity in posterior association areas; decreased local connectivity in sensory (visual and auditory) and medial frontal cortices; and decreased global connectivity in the cingulate cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and pons. Using a data-driven analysis method in task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show increased connectivity in critical areas of association cortex and decreased connectivity in primary cortex. This supports previous findings of a critical role for these association cortical regions as a final common pathway in generating the Lennox-Gastaut phenotype. Abnormal function of these areas is likely to be important in explaining the intellectual problems characteristic of this disorder.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

26336603	Outcomes and Treatment of Chronic Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Differs by Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) Type in Children With Cystic Fibrosis	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infects ∼25% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States. We hypothesized that health-related outcomes differed between healthcare-associated (staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec [SCCmec] II) vs community-associated (SCCmec IV) MRSA strains in patients chronically infected with CF. At 7 CF centers, MRSA isolates were prospectively obtained from patients ≤18 years old with 2 or more positive MRSA cultures within 1 year. Isolates were classified by SCCmec type and Panton-Valentine-leukocidin (PVL) status at a core laboratory, and sites remained blinded to SCCmec type and PVL results. Prospective clinical data including antibiotic use, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary exacerbations were obtained. Among the 295 cohort participants with typeable MRSA isolates, 69.5% had SCCmec II PVL(-), 13.2% had SCCmec IV PVL(-), and 17.3% had SCCmec IV PVL(+) strains. During follow-up of 287 patients with prospective data after enrollment, the risk for pulmonary exacerbations was significantly higher among participants with SCCmec II than SCCmec IV strains (risk ratio [RR] = 1.13; P = .03) and higher in those with SCCmec IV PVL(-) than SCCmec IV PVL(+) strains (RR = 1.62; P < .0001). Neither decline in lung function nor changes in nutritional outcomes differed by SCCmec type or PVL status during the study period. Participants harboring chronic SCCmec II MRSA received more antibiotics and may have more lung disease than those with SCCmec IV; PVL(+) isolates were not associated with more advanced disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

26340858	Life experiences of individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and disclosing outside the family: a qualitative analysis	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; OMIM 187300) is a disorder that affects 1:5000-1:10,000 people worldwide, with an estimated 60,000 affected individuals in the USA. Approximately 50 % of patients with HHT experience potentially life-threatening health complications such as stroke, brain abscess, or heart failure. However, the most common symptom is spontaneous and frequent nosebleeding. HHT is a hereditary condition with significant health consequences, but little is known about how individuals cope with HHT on a daily basis and how individuals share information about the disorder with social groups outside of the family. The objectives of this study were to improve understanding of the daily experiences of patients with diagnosed HHT and to investigate how they disclose their diagnosis to various social groups (friends, dating partners, employers, and coworkers) outside of their biological family. Adult patients seen at a university HHT clinic and who had been diagnosed with HHT for at least 6 months were recruited by mail. Participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 19). A qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts identified four major categories: (1) the emotional impact of HHT, (2) the social impact of HHT, (3) concerns for current and future health related to HHT, and (4) social context drives disclosure of HHT. Participants reported that although HHT was a manageable hereditary disorder, the symptoms negatively affected their daily life. It is important for health care providers to understand how individuals with rare genetic disorders are managing.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			301	Life experiences of individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and disclosing outside the family: a qualitative analysis.

26368820	Efficient Activation of Pathogenic ΔPhe501 Mutation in Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 by Chemical and Pharmacological Chaperones	Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a thyroid hormone transmembrane transporter expressed in many cell types, including neurons. Mutations that inactivate transport activity of MCT8 cause severe X-linked psychomotor retardation in male patients, a syndrome originally described as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Treatment options currently explored the focus on finding thyroid hormone-like compounds that bypass MCT8 and enter cells through different transporters. Because MCT8 is a multipass transmembrane protein, some pathogenic mutations affect membrane trafficking while potentially retaining some transporter activity. We explore here the effects of chemical and pharmacological chaperones on the expression and transport activity of the MCT8 mutant ΔPhe501. Dimethylsulfoxide, 4-phenylbutyric acid as well as its sodium salt, and the isoflavone genistein increase T3 uptake into MDCK1 cells stably transfected with mutant MCT8-ΔPhe501. We show that ΔPhe501 represents a temperature-sensitive mutant protein that is stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. 4-Phenylbutyrate has been used to stabilize ΔPhe508 mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein and is in clinical use in patients with urea cycle defects. Genistein is enriched in soy and available as a nutritional supplement. It is effective in stabilizing MCT8-ΔPhe501 at 100 nM concentration. Expression of the L471P mutant is increased in response to phenylbutyrate, but T3 uptake activity is not induced, supporting the notion that the chaperone specifically increases membrane expression. Our findings suggest that certain pathogenic MCT8 mutants may be responsive to (co-)treatment with readily available compounds, which increase endogenous protein function.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26393959	The minimal important difference of the epistaxis severity score in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease of abnormal angiogenesis, causing epistaxis in over 96% of patients. The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) was developed as a standardized measurement of nasal symptoms among HHT patients. The minimal important difference (MID) of a disease index estimates the smallest change that a patient and clinician would identify as important. This study aims to establish the MID of the ESS in a diverse population of HHT patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study in patients with a diagnosis of HHT using Curacao criteria or genetic testing. The ESS questionnaire and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) were administered to participants recruited through the HHT Foundation Web site. Demographics and relevant medical histories were collected from all participants. An anchor-based method using a change of 5 in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 and a distributional method were used to estimate the MID. A total of 604 subjects were recruited between April and August 2008. All participants reported epistaxis. An increasing ESS in the study cohort showed a significant negative correlation to the PCS (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). The MID was determined to be 0.41 via the anchor-based approach and 1.01 via the distribution-based approach, giving a mean MID of 0.71. Using both the anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, the estimated MID for the ESS in HHT is 0.71. Further implications include key metrics to help guide treatment responses in clinical care and essential information to calculate power and sample size for future clinical trials. 4.

26432887	The zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle as a model system for the molecular mechanisms by which the lack of Polycystin-2 leads to stimulation of CFTR	In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst inflation and continuous enlargement are associated with marked transepithelial ion and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Indeed, the inhibition or degradation of CFTR prevents the fluid accumulation within cysts. The in vivo mechanisms by which the lack of Polycystin-2 leads to CFTR stimulation are an outstanding challenge in ADPKD research and may bring important biomarkers for the disease. However, hampering their study, the available ADPKD in vitro cellular models lack the three-dimensional architecture of renal cysts and the ADPKD mouse models offer limited access for live-imaging experiments in embryonic kidneys. Here, we tested the zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle (KV) as an alternative model-organ. KV is a fluid-filled vesicular organ, lined by epithelial cells that express both CFTR and Polycystin-2 endogenously, being each of them easily knocked-down. Our data on the intracellular distribution of Polycystin-2 support its involvement in the KV fluid-flow induced Ca(2+)-signalling. Mirroring kidney cysts, the KV lumen inflation is dependent on CFTR activity and, as we clearly show, the knockdown of Polycystin-2 results in larger KV lumens through overstimulation of CFTR. In conclusion, we propose the zebrafish KV as a model organ to study the renal cyst inflation. Favouring its use, KV volume can be easily determined by in vivo imaging offering a live readout for screening compounds and genes that may prevent cyst enlargement through CFTR inhibition.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

A review of current literature was performed using the MEDLINE search string: ""Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL] AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL])"". Due to the lack of therapeutic consequence, systematic screening for hepatic involvement in asymptomatic patients with HHT is currently not recommended. In symptomatic patients, diagnostic tools include non-invasive techniques such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT and/or MRI. In any case, liver biopsy should be avoided in patients with suspected HHT because of the high bleeding risk. Liver transplantation is currently the only curative option for symptomatic hepatic involvement in HHT. Except for biliary or hepatocellular necrosis, which require urgent liver transplantation, consensus on the most appropriate timing of transplantation is lacking. Recent studies have shown a promising role for angiogenesis inhibitors as a causative treatment for hepatic involvement in HHT and its complications. Identification of specific risk factors for progression to the symptomatic phase is one of the main future challenges. This would subsequently allow for individualized and cost-effective screening of high-risk patients when they are still in the asymptomatic stage. However, until then screening in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Additionally the effect of preventive measures in this high-risk population on the development of symptomatic liver involvement and on poor outcome should be established."	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			307	"Hepatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler Weber syndrome.

26459101	The OpdQ porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is regulated by environmental signals associated with cystic fibrosis including nitrate-induced regulation involving the NarXL two-component system	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts. Multiple porins modulate outer membrane permeability under various environmental conditions. The lung environment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is unique with changes occurring in nutrient availability, osmolarity, and oxygen content. Although P. aeruginosa gene expression is modified under these conditions, little is known about how they influence porin regulation. In this study, we evaluated the regulation of the outer membrane porin OpdQ, a member of the OprD family of porins, with regard to oxygen, nitrate, and/or NaCl levels. We demonstrated using promoter::fusion clones of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and clinical strains collected from CF patients that OpdQ was transcriptionally repressed under low oxygen but increased in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ was found to be dependent on the transcription factor NarL via the NarXL two-component system. In addition, NaCl-induced osmotic stress increased OpdQ production among most of the clinical strains evaluated. In conclusion, these data identify for the first time that specific environmental cues associated with the CF microenvironment influence porin regulation, and that the nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ is associated with nitrate metabolism via the NarXL two-component system of P. aeruginosa.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26611353	De novo DNM1 mutations in two cases of epileptic encephalopathy	Dynamin 1 (DNM1) is a large guanosine triphosphatase involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In recent studies, de novo mutations in DNM1 have been identified in five individuals with epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, we report two patients with early onset epileptic encephalopathy possessing de novo DNM1 mutations. Using whole exome sequencing, we detected the novel mutation c.127G>A (p.Gly43Ser) in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and a recurrent mutation c.709C>T (p.Arg237Trp) in a patient with West syndrome. Structural consideration of DNM1 mutations revealed that both mutations would destabilize the G domain structure and impair nucleotide binding, dimer formation, and/or GTPase activity of the G domain. These and previous cases of DNM1 mutations were reviewed to verify the phenotypic spectrum. The main clinical features of DNM1 mutations include intractable seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Most cases showed development delay before the onset of seizures. A patient carrying p.Arg237Trp in this report showed a different developmental status from that of a previously reported case, together with characteristic extrapyramidal movement.

Structural consideration of DNM1 mutations revealed that both mutations would destabilize the G domain structure and impair nucleotide binding, dimer formation, and/or GTPase activity of the G domain. These and previous cases of DNM1 mutations were reviewed to verify the phenotypic spectrum. The main clinical features of DNM1 mutations include intractable seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Most cases showed development delay before the onset of seizures. A patient carrying p.Arg237Trp in this report showed a different developmental status from that of a previously reported case, together with characteristic extrapyramidal movement.
26615753	Identification of Scedosporium boydii catalase A1 gene, a reactive oxygen species detoxification factor highly expressed in response to oxidative stress and phagocytic cells	Scedosporium boydii is an opportunistic filamentous fungus which may be responsible for a large variety of infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. This fungus belongs to the Scedosporium apiospermum species complex which usually ranks second among the filamentous fungi colonizing the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Species of the S. apiospermum complex are able to chronically colonize the CF airways suggesting pathogenic mechanisms allowing persistence and growth of these fungi in the respiratory tract. Few putative virulence factors have been purified and characterized so far in the S. apiospermum complex including a cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a monofunctional catalase (catalase A1). Upon microbial infection, host phagocytes release reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, as part of the antimicrobial response. Catalases are known to protect pathogens against ROS by degradation of the hydrogen peroxide. Here, we identified the S. boydii catalase A1 gene (CATA1) and investigated its expression in response to the environmental conditions encountered in the CF airways and to the oxidative stress. Results showed that S. boydii CATA1 gene expression is not affected by hypoxia, hypercapnia or pH changes. In contrast, CATA1 gene was overexpressed in response to a chemically induced oxidative stress with a relative gene expression 37-fold higher in the presence of 250 μM H(2)O(2), 20-fold higher with 250 μM menadione and 5-fold higher with 2 mM paraquat. Moreover, S. boydii CATA1 gene expression progressively increased upon exposure to activated THP-1-derived macrophages, reaching a maximum after 12 h (26 fold). Activated HL60-derived neutrophils and activated human peripheral blood neutrophils more rapidly induced S. boydii CATA1 gene overexpression, a maximum gene expression level being reached at 75 min (17 fold) and 60 min (15 fold), respectively. In contrast expression of the gene encoding the Cu,Zn-SOD (SODC gene) was not affected by H(2)O(2), menadione, paraquat or in co-culture with phagocytic cells. These results suggest that S. boydii CATA1 gene is highly stimulated by the oxidative burst response whereas SODC gene is constitutively expressed.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26633362	RpoN Regulates Virulence Factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via Modulating the PqsR Quorum Sensing Regulator	The alternative sigma factor RpoN regulates many cell functions, such as motility, quorum sensing, and virulence in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). P. aeruginosa often evolves rpoN-negative variants during the chronic infection in cystic fibrosis patients. It is unclear how RpoN interacts with other regulatory mechanisms to control virulence of P. aeruginosa. In this study, we show that RpoN modulates the function of PqsR, a quorum sensing receptor regulating production of virulence factors including the phenazine pyocyanin. The ∆rpoN mutant is able to synthesize 4-quinolone signal molecule HHQ but unable to activate PqsR and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (pqs) quorum sensing. The ∆rpoN mutant produces minimal level of pyocyanin and is unable to produce the anti-staphylococcal agents. Providing pqsR in trans in the ∆rpoN mutant restores its pqs quorum sensing and virulence factor production to the wild-type level. Our study provides evidence that RpoN has a regulatory effect on P. aeruginosa virulence through modulating the function of the PqsR quorum sensing regulator.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26645412	GABRB3 mutations: a new and emerging cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy	The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor β3 gene (GABRB3) encodes the β3-subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor, which mediates inhibitory signalling within the central nervous system. Recently, GABRB3 mutations have been identified in a few patients with infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We report the clinical and electrographic features of a novel case of GABRB3-related early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Our patient presented with neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, then developed pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by multiple seizure types from 3 months of age. Electroencephalography demonstrated ictal generalized and interictal multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Using a SureSelectXT custom multiple gene panel covering 48 early infantile epileptic encephalopathy/developmental delay genes, a novel de novo GABRB3 heterozygous missense mutation, c.860C>T (p.Thr287Ile), was identified and confirmed on Sanger sequencing. GABRB3 is an emerging cause of early-onset epilepsy. Novel genetic technologies, such as whole-exome/genome sequencing and multiple gene panels, will undoubtedly identify further cases, allowing more detailed electroclinical delineation of the GABRB3-related genotypic and phenotypic spectra.

26646071	Endoglin regulates mural cell adhesion in the circulatory system	The circulatory system is walled off by different cell types, including vascular mural cells and podocytes. The interaction and interplay between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells, such as vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes, play a pivotal role in vascular biology. Endoglin is an RGD-containing counter-receptor for β1 integrins and is highly expressed by ECs during angiogenesis. We find that the adhesion between vascular ECs and mural cells is enhanced by integrin activators and inhibited upon suppression of membrane endoglin or β1-integrin, as well as by addition of soluble endoglin (SolEng), anti-integrin α5β1 antibody or an RGD peptide. Analysis of different endoglin mutants, allowed the mapping of the endoglin RGD motif as involved in the adhesion process. In Eng (+/-) mice, a model for hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia type 1, endoglin haploinsufficiency induces a pericyte-dependent increase in vascular permeability. Also, transgenic mice overexpressing SolEng, an animal model for preeclampsia, show podocyturia, suggesting that SolEng is responsible for podocytes detachment from glomerular capillaries. These results suggest a critical role for endoglin in integrin-mediated adhesion of mural cells and provide a better understanding on the mechanisms of vessel maturation in normal physiology as well as in pathologies such as preeclampsia or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

26715741	Trace incorporation of heavy water reveals slow and heterogeneous pathogen growth rates in cystic fibrosis sputum	Effective treatment for chronic infections is undermined by a significant gap in understanding of the physiological state of pathogens at the site of infection. Chronic pulmonary infections are responsible for the morbidity and mortality of millions of immunocompromised individuals worldwide, yet drugs that are successful in laboratory culture are far less effective against pathogen populations persisting in vivo. Laboratory models, upon which preclinical development of new drugs is based, can only replicate host conditions when we understand the metabolic state of the pathogens and the degree of heterogeneity within the population. In this study, **we measured the anabolic activity of the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus directly in the sputum of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), by combining the high sensitivity of isotope ratio mass spectrometry with a heavy water labeling approach to capture the full range of in situ growth rates. **Our results reveal S. aureus generation times with a median of 2.1 d, with extensive growth rate heterogeneity at the single-cell level. These growth rates are far below the detection limit of previous estimates of CF pathogen growth rates, and the rates are slowest in acutely sick patients undergoing pulmonary exacerbations; nevertheless, they are accessible to experimental replication within laboratory models. Treatment regimens that include specific antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin) further appear to correlate with slow growth of S. aureus on average, but follow-up longitudinal studies must be performed to determine whether this effect holds for individual patients.	cystic fibrosis			283	Trace incorporation of heavy water reveals slow and heterogeneous pathogen growth rates in cystic fibrosis sputum.

26724101	Cannabidiol in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy: an open-label interventional trial	Almost a third of patients with epilepsy have a treatment-resistant form, which is associated with severe morbidity and increased mortality. Cannabis-based treatments for epilepsy have generated much interest, but scientific data are scarce**. We aimed to establish whether addition of cannabidiol to existing anti-epileptic regimens would be safe, tolerated, and efficacious in children and young adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. In this open-label trial, patients (aged 1-30 years**) with severe, intractable, childhood-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy, who were receiving stable doses of antiepileptic drugs before study entry, were enrolled in an expanded-access programme at 11 epilepsy centres across the USA. Patients were given oral cannabidiol at 2-5 mg/kg per day, up-titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day (dependent on study site). The primary objective was to establish the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol and the primary efficacy endpoint was median percentage change in the mean monthly frequency of motor seizures at 12 weeks. The efficacy analysis was by modified intention to treat. Comparisons of the percentage change in frequency of motor seizures were done with a Mann-Whitney U test. Between Jan 15, 2014, and Jan 15, 2015, 214 patients were enrolled; 162 (76%) patients who had at least 12 weeks of follow-up after the first dose of cannabidiol were included in the safety and tolerability analysis, and 137 (64%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. In the safety group, 33 (20%) patients had Dravet syndrome and 31 (19%) patients had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The remaining patients had intractable epilepsies of different causes and type. Adverse events were reported in 128 (79%) of the 162 patients within the safety group. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients were somnolence (n=41 [25%]), decreased appetite (n=31 [19%]), diarrhoea (n=31 [19%]), fatigue (n=21 [13%]), and convulsion (n=18 [11%]). Five (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Serious adverse events were reported in 48 (30%) patients, including one death-a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy regarded as unrelated to study drug. 20 (12%) patients had severe adverse events possibly related to cannabidiol use, the most common of which was status epilepticus (n=9 [6%]). The median monthly frequency of motor seizures was 30.0 (IQR 11.0-96.0) at baseline and 15.8 (5.6-57.6) over the 12 week treatment period. The median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 36.5% (IQR 0-64.7). Our findings suggest that cannabidiol might reduce seizure frequency and might have an adequate safety profile in children and young adults with highly treatment-resistant epilepsy. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to characterise the safety profile and true efficacy of this compound.

26751606	Treatment of severe refractory epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia using a two-flap nasal closure method	Nasal closure has been shown to effectively manage severe epistaxis refractory to other treatments in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The nasal closure procedure may be underutilized because of its surgical complexity and flap breakdown. This work is a retrospective review of 13 HHT patients treated for severe epistaxis with nasal closure between 2005 and 2013. Operating room (OR) time, need for revision surgery, preprocedure, and postprocedure epistaxis severity score (ESS), complete blood count values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire results were collected for each patient. The technique is described. We characterize a typical nasal closure patient and compare outcomes based on our experience with the traditional 3-flap closure and a simplified 2-flap nasal closure procedure. The average candidate for nasal closure in this series had an ESS of 7.88, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, and received multiple transfusions, iron therapy, and cautery/coagulation procedures. Average ESS subsequent to nasal closure using the 2-flap method is 0.92 and mean GBI score is 56.3. Comparison of 5 patients who underwent the traditional 3-flap nasal closure procedure and 8 patients receiving the 2-flap nasal closure showed no significant difference in postoperative ESS or GBI metrics. Mean operating room times of the traditional and simplified methods were 3.12 hours and 1.44 hours (p = 0.0001). Mean time to first revision for 8 nasal closure patients was 21.5 months.

26805435	Safety and pharmacokinetic profile of rufinamide in pediatric patients aged less than 4 years with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: An interim analysis from a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study	A good knowledge of safety and age group-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in young pediatric patients is of great importance in clinical practice. **This paper presents 6-month interim safety and PK from an ongoing 2-year open-label study (Study 303) of adjunctive rufinamide treatment in pediatric subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years with inadequately controlled epilepsies of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) spectrum.** Subjects (N = 37) were randomized to either rufinamide or any other approved AED chosen by the investigator as adjunctive therapy to the subject's existing regimen of 1-3 AEDs. Interim safety results showed that treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the rufinamide (22 [88.0%]) and any-other-AED group (9 [81.8%]), with most events considered mild or moderate. A population PK analysis was conducted including plasma rufinamide concentrations from Study 303 and two other study populations of LGS subjects ≥ 4 years. The rufinamide PK profile was dose independent. The apparent clearance (CL/F) estimated from the PK model was 2.19 L/h; it was found to increase significantly as a function of body weight. Coadministration of valproic acid significantly decreased rufinamide CL/F. CL/F was not significantly affected by other concomitant AEDs, age, gender, race, hepatic function, or renal function. No adjustments to body weight-based rufinamide dosing in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 years are necessary. Rufinamide was safe and well tolerated in these pediatric subjects. Results from the interim analysis demonstrate that rufinamide's safety and PK profile is comparable in subjects ≥ 1 to < 4 and ≥ 4 years with LGS. Study 303 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01405053).

26808205	Pontine and cerebral atrophy in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe epilepsy of childhood onset associated with intellectual disability and multiple seizure types. Characteristic interictal electrographic discharges include generalized paroxysmal fast activity and slow spike and wave, which we have previously shown recruit widespread areas of association cortex. We wished to determine whether patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have changes in cerebral volumes that match this pattern of cortical recruitment. High resolution T1 weighted structural MRI was collected from 10 patients with LGS and 10 age and sex matched controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to compare tissue volumes across the whole brain (grey matter, white matter and CSF) and pontine volume between patients and controls, as well as to identify other regions of maximal tissue loss. LGS patients showed a significant decrease in whole brain volume compared to controls. Cortical atrophy was prominent in the mesial frontal region and bilateral anterior temporal poles. White matter atrophy was widespread and included peri-central and premotor regions. Atrophy was prominent in the pons, particularly in the region of the reticular formation. Grey matter atrophy trended to progress with age. Grey and white matter atrophy are a feature of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Grey matter atrophy is apparent in the mesial frontal lobe suggesting this region may be an important node in the epilepsy network of LGS. Atrophy maximal in the pons and cerebellum mimics the patterns of seizure spread that has been previously observed during tonic seizures. This supports the idea that the pons is a key part of the epilepsy network in LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

26824272	Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures based on volatile biomarker combinations	Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath is proposed as a non-invasive method to detect respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Since polymicrobial infections are common, we assessed whether we could distinguish Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures using the VOC emissions. We took headspace samples of P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus and co-cultures at 16, 24 and 48 h after inoculation, in which VOCs were identified by thermal desorption combined with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Using multivariate analysis by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis we found distinct VOC biomarker combinations for mono- and co-cultures at each sampling time point, showing that there is an interaction between the two pathogens, with P. aeruginosa dominating the co-culture at 48 h. Furthermore, time-independent VOC biomarker combinations were also obtained to predict correct identification of P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus in mono-culture and in co-culture. This study shows that the VOC combinations in P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus co-microbial environment are different from those released by these pathogens in mono-culture.

Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath is proposed as a non-invasive method to detect respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Since polymicrobial infections are common, we assessed whether we could distinguish Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures using the VOC emissions. We took headspace samples of P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus and co-cultures at 16, 24 and 48 h after inoculation, in which VOCs were identified by thermal desorption combined with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Using multivariate analysis by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis we found distinct VOC biomarker combinations for mono- and co-cultures at each sampling time point, showing that there is an interaction between the two pathogens, with P. aeruginosa dominating the co-culture at 48 h. Furthermore, time-independent VOC biomarker combinations were also obtained to predict correct identification of P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus in mono-culture and in co-culture. This study shows that the VOC combinations in P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus co-microbial environment are different from those released by these pathogens in mono-culture. Using advanced data analysis techniques such as PLS-DA, time-independent pathogen specific biomarker combinations can be generated that may help to detect mixed respiratory infections in exhaled breath of cystic fibrosis patients.
26827266	Long-term safety and seizure outcome in Japanese patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome receiving adjunctive rufinamide therapy: An open-label study following a randomized clinical trial	To evaluate the long-term safety and seizure outcome in Japanese patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) receiving adjunctive rufinamide therapy. We conducted an open-label extension study following a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive rufinamide therapy in Japanese patients with LGS. Fifty-four patients participated in the extension study. Seizure frequency was evaluated until 52 weeks after the start of the extension study. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout both studies. Of the 54 patients, 41 (75.9%) completed the extension study. The median duration of exposure to rufinamide was 818.0 days in all 54 patients, and 38 patients (70.4%) received rufinamide for 2 years or more. The median percent change in the frequency of tonic-atonic seizures relative to the frequency at the start of the double-blind study was -39.3% (12 weeks), -40.6% (24 weeks), -46.8% (32 weeks), -47.6% (40 weeks), and -36.1% (52 weeks). Reduction of total seizure frequency was also maintained until 52 weeks. Frequent treatment-related AEs were somnolence (20.4%), decreased appetite (16.7%), transient seizure aggravation including status epilepticus (13.0%), vomiting (11.1%), and constipation (11.1%). Adverse events were mild or moderate, except for transient seizure aggravation in three patients. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of rufinamide were decreased appetite, drug eruption, and worsening of underlying autism. When clinically notable weight loss was defined as a decrease ≥ 7% relative to baseline, 22 patients (40.7%) experienced weight loss at least once during long-term observation, although weight loss was reported as an AE in only three patients. This study demonstrated a long-term benefit of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy for Japanese patients with LGS. Exacerbation of seizures and decreased appetite/weight loss should be monitored carefully.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

26828692	Evaluating the safety and efficacy of felbamate in the context of a black box warning: A single center experience	Felbamate was approved in 1993 to treat partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in children. Its use was later restricted when rare but fatal cases of aplastic anemia and hepatic failure were identified. This single center analysis retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of felbamate in a cohort of children, adolescents, and adults with epilepsy. A chart review identified 103 patients taking felbamate. The range of felbamate dose was 300-4500 mg (mean: 1800 ± 900 mg). The duration of therapy ranged from 1 month to 20 years (mean duration: 35 ± 45 months). Eighteen (17.5%) subjects experienced adverse events including insomnia, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, gastric discomfort, diarrhea, mood and behavioral problems, high blood pressure, headache, and elevated liver enzymes. Out of these, 6 (5.9%) patients discontinued the therapy. No hepatic failure or agranulocytosis was observed. Fifty-nine (57.72%) patients achieved ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 30 (29.12%) patients achieved seizure freedom. These findings suggest that felbamate is safe, well tolerated, and effective in treatment of various types of epilepsy syndromes.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

26836699	Unilateral endoscopic endonasal surgery for resection of an olfactory schwannoma of the anterior cranial base in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Olfactory schwannomas of the anterior cranial base (ACB) are rare tumors and their association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) has not previously been described. The majority of ACB schwannomas arise from the sinonasal tracts and may demonstrate intracranial extension. We report a case of an olfactory schwannoma dense adherence to the basal frontal lobe . Complete tumor resection was performed through a unilateral extended endonasal endoscopic approach with preservation of the contralateral olfactory bulb. Anterior cranial base repair was achieved with a contralateral mucoperichondrial vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap. A twenty-five-year-old female with a history of migraines presented with unilateral epistaxis and progressive worsening of her headache symptoms. The patient had a history of HHT. Nasal endoscopy showed mild telangiectasias, but no clear evidence of a mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large left-sided expansile lesion in the left ethmoid region with expansion and remodeling of the anterior cranial base mass and medial left orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed the mass to be avidly enhancing. Angiography was performed and demonstrated a mild vascular blush. We report a rare case of HTT and olfactory schwannoma completely resected with a unilateral extended endoscopic endonasal approach. Reconstruction was performed with a contralateral nasoseptal flap. This is the first reported single stage fully endoscopic endonasal unilateral approach for resection of an olfactory schwannoma with preservation of the contralateral olfactory cleft. The patient's sense of smell and taste was maintained postoperatively.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

26842220	Nocturnal interictal epileptic discharges in adult Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: the effect of sleep stage and time of night	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is characterized by interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) occurring during sleep. The aim of this study was to determine whether sleep influences not only the frequency of seizures and IEDs, but also the time-dependent evolution that may support the hypothesis of homeostatic influences on epileptic threshold. Video polysomnography data from our database were reviewed to identify adult LGS patients with at least seven hours of nocturnal recording. Thirteen patients were identified and a second polysomnography was available for nine. The number, duration and index of IEDs, relative to total sleep, sleep stages, and time during the night, were calculated. The majority of IEDs occurred during non-rapid eye movement sleep, mainly in stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. Adjusting for time spent in each sleep stage, we found 45 IEDs/hour in stage 1, 123/hour in stage 2, 106/hour in slow-wave sleep, and 26/hour in rapid eye movement sleep. The temporal distribution of IEDs showed a significant rise in the first three hours of sleep, followed by a progressive decrease at the end of the night (F=85.6; p<0.0001). Interictal epileptiform discharges occurrence in adult LGS is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement sleep with an evident effect of stage 2 and slow-wave sleep. The significant IED occurrence in the first part of the night and the subsequent decline suggests a link between epileptic threshold and homeostatic sleep mechanisms. The latter should be considered regarding choice of therapy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

26846474	On the mechanism of gating defects caused by the R117H mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator	Two functional abnormalities of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a 25% reduction of the single-channel conductance (g) and a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po ), were found with the R117H mutation that is associated with mild forms of cystic fibrosis. Characterizations of the gating defects of R117H-CFTR led to the conclusion that the mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains (TMDs) without altering the function of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Nonetheless, gating of the R117H-CFTR can be improved by a variety of pharmacological reagents supposedly acting on NBDs such as ATP analogues, or TMDs (e.g. VX-770 or nitrate). These reagents potentiate synergistically R117H-CFTR gating to a level that allows accurate assessments of its gating deficits. Our studies not only elucidate the mechanism underpinning gating dysfunction of R117H-CFTR, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how VX-770 ameliorates the gating defects in the R117H mutant. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated chloride channel. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for the gating defects manifested in R117H-CFTR, an arginine-to-histidine substitution at position 117 of CFTR that is associated with mild forms of CF. We confirmed previous findings of a 25% decrease of the single-channel conductance (g) in R117H-CFTR, but found a ∼13-fold lower open probability (Po ). This dramatic gating deficit is not due to dysfunctional nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as the mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for ATP, and the mutant channels respond to ATP analogues in a similar manner as wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, once ATP hydrolysis is abolished, the R117H mutant can be trapped in a prolonged 'burst opening' conformation that is proposed to be equipped with a stable NBD dimer. On the other hand, our results support the conclusion that the R117H mutation decreases Po by perturbing the gating conformational changes in CFTR's transmembrane domains as even when NBDs are kept at a dimerized configuration, Po is reduced by ∼10-fold. Moreover, our data demonstrate that a synergistic improvement of R117H-CFTR function can be accomplished with a combined regiment of VX-770 (Ivacaftor), nitrate ion (NO3 (-) ) and N(6) -(2-phenylethyl)-2'-deoxy-ATP (d-PATP), which almost completely rectifies the gating defect of R117H-CFTR. Clinical implications of our results are discussed.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Patients with diagnosis of non-symptomatic epilepsy supervised from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, collecting epidemiological, clinical, complementary examinations and developmental data. Of the 4595 children attended during the period, the diagnosis of epilepsy was established in 605 (13.17%): 156 (25.79%) idiopathic epilepsies and 172 (28.43%) cryptogenic epilepsies. 15.7% of cryptogenic epilepsies and 14.1% of idiopathic epilepsies are refractory to treatment. Some epileptic syndromes, such as reflex epilepsies, Dravet syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, have higher rates of drug resistance. 84.62% of idiopathic epilepsies and 79.77% of cryptogenic epilepsies present no other associated neurological disorder. A useful classification would be etiological, with two groups: a large group with established etiology or very likely genetic syndromes and another with no established cause. The age of onset of epilepsy in each etiological group adds prognostic orientation. Prognosis of epilepsy is worsened by refractoriness and associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and are generally worse at an earlier onset and in certain etiologies.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

Published reports describing the use of rufinamide specifically in adult patients with LGS are scarce. A post hoc subgroup analysis of data from a phase III trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of rufinamide in adults with LGS. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with LGS, aged 4 years and above. During an 84-day, double-blind treatment period, patients received either adjunctive rufinamide therapy or placebo. Efficacy and safety/tolerability were assessed in a post hoc subgroup analysis of adult patients (≥18 years). Efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency, 50% responder rate, and seizure freedom rate; each calculated for total seizures and drop attacks. Safety/tolerability assessments included the evaluation of adverse events (AEs). Thirty-one adults aged 18-37 years with LGS received treatment with either rufinamide (n = 21) or placebo (n = 10). Three patients in the rufinamide group did not complete the trial. The median change from baseline in seizure frequency was -31.5% for rufinamide versus +22.1% for placebo (P = 0.008) for all seizures and -54.9% versus +21.7% (P = 0.002) for drop attacks. Responder rates were 33.3% for rufinamide versus 0% for placebo (P = 0.066) for all seizures and 57.1% versus 10.0% (P = 0.020) for drop attacks. No patient achieved freedom from all seizures but two rufinamide-treated patients (9.5%) became free of drop attacks. Overall, 71.4% of patients treated with rufinamide and 60.0% of patients treated with placebo experienced AEs; most commonly, somnolence (33.3% vs. 20.0%) and vomiting (19.0% vs. 0%). Most AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Rufinamide demonstrated favorable efficacy and was generally well tolerated when used as adjunctive treatment for adults with LGS. Eisai.

26873746	Usefulness of Transcranial Doppler for Detecting Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	The aim of this study was to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) as a screening test for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This retrospective study included suspected patients with HHT who were screened for PAVM with a TCD and a chest computed tomography (CT) study. The results of TCD and CT were compared to evaluate the usefulness of TCD for detecting PAVM. A TCD Spencer grade ≥3 was defined as positive for a significant right-to-left shunt (RLS). The diameter of the pulmonary arteries feeding the PAVM was measured by calipers from the CT study. In 86 subjects from 74 families with HHT, the sensitivity of TCD for identifying a PAVM at rest was 98% and post-Valsalva was 100%. Specificity was 58% and 35%, respectively, presumably due to pulmonary shunts too small to recognize on CT. Of the patients with HHT who were referred for embolization therapy for their PAVMs, all 20 had TCD grade ≥3. In patients who were diagnosed with a PAVM by chest CT, patients with TCD grade ≥5 had a significantly larger sum of artery diameters feeding the PAVMs compared to those with grade ≤4 (5.0 ± 3.2 mm vs 2.6 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a TCD examination for evaluating RLS is sensitive for identifying PAVM in patients with HHT and is useful in quantitating the degree of RLS flow. The sensitivity of the TCD examination makes it a useful screening test without radiation in HHT subjects to determine which patients need to undergo CT evaluation to identify PAVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

26874684	Function and regulation of TRPM7, as well as intracellular magnesium content, are altered in cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR	Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common fatal hereditary disorders, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene product is a multidomain adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) protein that functions as a chloride (Cl(-)) channel that is regulated by intracellular magnesium [Mg(2+)]i. The most common mutations in CFTR are a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR, 70-80 % of CF phenotypes) and a Gly551Asp substitution (G551D-CFTR, 4-5 % of alleles), which lead to decreased or almost abolished Cl(-) channel function, respectively. Magnesium ions have to be finely regulated within cells for optimal expression and function of CFTR. Therefore, the melastatin-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7), which is responsible for Mg(2+) entry, was studies and [Mg(2+)]i measured in cells stably expressing wildtype CFTR, and two mutant proteins (ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR). This study shows for the first time that [Mg(2+)]i is decreased in cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR mutated proteins. It was also observed that the expression of the TRPM7 protein is increased; however, membrane localization was altered for both ΔF508del-CFTR and G551D-CFTR. Furthermore, both the function and regulation of the TRPM7 channel regarding Mg(2+) is decreased in the cells expressing the mutated CFTR. Ca(2+) influx via TRPM7 were also modified in cells expressing a mutated CFTR. Therefore, there appears to be a direct involvement of TRPM7 in CF physiopathology. Finally, we propose that the TRPM7 activator Naltriben is a new potentiator for G551D-CFTR as the function of this mutant increases upon activation of TRPM7 by Naltriben.	cystic fibrosis	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		341	Function and regulation of TRPM7, as well as intracellular magnesium content, are altered in cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR. Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common fatal hereditary disorders, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene product is a multidomain adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) protein that functions as a chloride (Cl(-)) channel that is regulated by intracellular magnesium [Mg(2+)]i. The most common mutations in CFTR are a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR, 70-80 % of CF phenotypes) and a Gly551Asp substitution (G551D-CFTR, 4-5 % of alleles), which lead to decreased or almost abolished Cl(-) channel function, respectively. Magnesium ions have to be finely regulated within cells for optimal expression and function of CFTR. Therefore, the melastatin-like transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7), which is responsible for Mg(2+) entry, was studies and [Mg(2+)]i measured in cells stably expressing wildtype CFTR, and two mutant proteins (ΔF508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR).

26879174	An ERp57-mediated disulphide exchange promotes the interaction between Burkholderia cenocepacia and epithelial respiratory cells	Previous studies have demonstrated that extracellular glutathione reduces the ability of the Cystic Fibrosis pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia to infect primary or immortalized epithelial respiratory cells. We report here that the adhesion and invasion ability of B. cenocepacia is limited also by thiol-oxidizing and disulphide-reducing agents and by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibitors. PDI inhibitors also reduce the proinflammatory response elicited by cells in response to Burkholderia. These findings indicate that a membrane-associated PDI catalyzes thiol/disulphide exchange reactions which favor bacterial infection. The combined use of selective PDI inhibitors, RNA silencing and specific antibodies identified ERp57 as a major PDI involved in the interaction between B. cenocepacia and epithelial cells. This study contributes to the elucidation of the Burkholderia pathogenic mechanisms by showing that this microorganism exploits a membrane-associated host protein to infect epithelial cells and identifies ERp57 as a putative pharmacological target for the treatment of Burkholderia lung infections.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

26902541	Validation of a Spanish version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis	The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) has been validated in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBC). The present study aimed to create and validate a Spanish version of the LCQ (LCQ-Sp) in NCFBC. The LCQ-Sp was developed following a standardized protocol. For reliability, we assessed internal consistency and the change in score over a 15-day period in stable state. For responsiveness, we assessed the change in scores between visit 1 and the first exacerbation. For validity, we evaluated convergent validity through correlation with the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and discriminant validity. Two hundred fifty-nine patients (118 mild bronchiectasis, 90 moderate bronchiectasis and 47 severe bronchiectasis) were included. Internal consistency was high for the total scoring and good for the different domains (Cronbach's α: 0.86-0.91). The test-retest reliability shows an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 for the total score. The mean LCQ-Sp score at visit 1 decreased at the beginning of an exacerbation (15.13 ± 4.06 vs. 12.24 ± 4.64; p < 0.001). The correlation between LCQ-Sp and SGRQ scores was -0.66 (p < 0.01). The differences in the LCQ-Sp total score between the different groups of severity were significant (p < 0.001). The LCQ-Sp discriminates disease severity, is responsive to change when faced with exacerbations and is reliable for use in bronchiectasis.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

26906013	Aggravation of atonic seizures by rufinamide: A case report	Rufinamide is a novel antiepileptic drug used as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and provides seizure control especially in tonic and atonic seizures. Rufinamide is expected to be effective in intractable epilepsy when atonic and tonic seizures exist. However, rufinamide induced seizure aggravation has been reported in a few patients, which was not associated with a specific type of seizure. A 12-year-old boy with intractable epilepsy had tonic and atonic seizures despite treatment with valproic acid (3000mg/day), levetiracetam (3000mg/day) and clobazam (40mg/day). Rufinamide was administered as adjuvant therapy. After 2weeks on rufinamide, he experienced atonic seizure worsening, and the frequency of epileptic discharges increased. The deterioration in seizure frequency and epileptiform discharges resolved when rufinamide was discontinued. Rufinamide may aggravate atonic seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy.

26950270	Epileptic encephalopathy de novo GABRB mutations impair γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor function	The Epi4K Consortium recently identified 4 de novo mutations in the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor β3 subunit gene GABRB3 and 1 in the β1 subunit gene GABRB1 in children with one of the epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and infantile spasms (IS). Because the etiology of EEs is often unknown, we determined the impact of GABRB mutations on GABAA receptor function and biogenesis. GABAA receptor α1 and γ2L subunits were coexpressed with wild-type and/or mutant β3 or β1 subunits in HEK 293T cells. Currents were measured using whole cell and single channel patch clamp techniques. Surface and total expression levels were measured using flow cytometry. Potential structural perturbations in mutant GABAA receptors were explored using structural modeling. LGS-associated GABRB3(D120N, E180G, Y302C) mutations located at β+ subunit interfaces reduced whole cell currents by decreasing single channel open probability without loss of surface receptors. In contrast, IS-associated GABRB3(N110D) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations at β- subunit interfaces produced minor changes in whole cell current peak amplitude but altered current deactivation by decreasing or increasing single channel burst duration, respectively. GABRB3(E180G) and GABRB1(F246S) mutations also produced spontaneous channel openings. All 5 de novo GABRB mutations impaired GABAA receptor function by rearranging conserved structural domains, supporting their role in EEs. The primary effect of LGS-associated mutations was reduced GABA-evoked peak current amplitudes, whereas the major impact of IS-associated mutations was on current kinetic properties. Despite lack of association with epilepsy syndromes, our results suggest GABRB1 as a candidate human epilepsy gene. Ann Neurol 2016;79:806-825.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

26977407	Challenges in identifying Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in adults: A case series illustrating its changing nature	The variable presentation and progression of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can make it difficult to recognize, particularly in adults. To improve diagnosis, a retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who were diagnosed as adults and/or were followed for several years after diagnosis. We present 5 cases that illustrate changes in LGS features over time. Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed by age 8 with intractable seizures, developmental delay, and abnormal EEGs with 1.5-2 Hz SSW discharges. However, seizure type and frequency changed over time for both patients, and the incidence of SSW discharges decreased. Cases 3, 4, and 5 were diagnosed with LGS as adults based on current and past features and symptoms, including treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive and motor impairment, and abnormal EEG findings. While incomplete, their records indicate that an earlier LGS diagnosis may have been missed or lost to history. These cases demonstrate the need to thoroughly and continuously evaluate all aspects of a patient's encephalopathy, bearing in mind the potential for LGS features to change over time.

26993353	Continent Catheterizable Vesicostomy: An Alternative Surgical Modality for Pediatric Patients With Large Bladder Capacity	To present a modified technique and early outcomes of a continent catheterizable vesicostomy in pediatric patients with either flaccid neurogenic bladder or intractable voiding dysfunction and large capacity bladder. Six patients underwent the procedure from October 2014 to December 2015. A 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made, avoiding intraperitoneal dissection. After adequate mobilization, a 2-cm vertical flap at the dome of the bladder was identified and tubularized over a 12Fr catheter with 4-0 vicryl suture. The tubularized flap was then intussuscepted into the bladder with four 4-0 polydioxanone sutures, creating a continent mechanism. The catheterizable channel was then tunneled to the umbilicus, the channel ostomy matured, and the cystotomy closed in two layers. The median patient age was 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 12) years. All patients had urinary dysfunction requiring drainage from etiologies that included Eagle-Barrett syndrome (n = 2), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 1), and Spina bifida (n = 2). Median hospital length of stay was 8 (IQR 3) days. One patient had a superficial wound infection treated with antibiotics, and 1 patient required balloon dilation of the catheterizable channel at 3 months postoperatively, secondary to difficulty self-catheterizing. Five patients were successfully self-catheterizing at last follow-up. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR 5) months and there were no intra- or perioperative complications. Continent catheterizable vesicostomy is a novel technique for urinary drainage in patients with large bladder capacity that spares use of the appendix or ileum. Early results are encouraging, providing a catheterizable channel through the umbilicus without urinary leakage between catheterization.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

Between 2/1990 and 7/2013, we registered 48 patients with the electroclinical diagnostic criteria of ES in clusters WoH. We recognized two subgroups. In the first subgroup of 30 patients, ES started at a mean age of 10.6 months (range, 2-40 months). Ictal EEG recordings showed diffuse high-amplitude slow waves in 15 patients, diffuse slow waves followed by voltage attenuation in six patients, diffuse fast rhythms in five, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in three, and diffuse sharp waves in one. In the second subgroup of 18 patients, nine had electroclinical features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, four had epilepsy with myoclonic and atonic seizures, two had Dravet syndrome, one 6-year-old boy had a non-convulsive status epilepticus characterized by atypical absences associated with ES, one had epilepsy with migrating seizures of infancy, and one patient had clinical features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis with ES. ES started at a mean age of 6.3 years (range, 0.5-13 years). The ictal EEG recording during the ES showed diffuse fast rhythms in 10 cases, diffuse slow waves with superimposed fast rhythms in four, and diffuse slow waves in four. Our study shows two subgroups of children with ESWoH.

27084387	Evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multisystemic disorder with broad clinical manifestations apart from the well-characterized pulmonary dysfunction. Recent findings have described impairment in conduit vessel function in patients with CF; however, whether microvascular function is affected in this population has yet to be elucidated. Using laser-Doppler imaging, we evaluated microvascular function through postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), local thermal hyperemia (LTH), and iontophoresis with acetylcholine (ACh). PORH [518 ± 174% (CF) and 801 ± 125% (control), P = 0.039], LTH [1,338 ± 436% (CF) and 1,574 ± 620% (control), P = 0.045], and iontophoresis with ACh [416 ± 140% (CF) and 617 ± 143% (control), P = 0.032] were significantly lower in patients with CF than control subjects. In addition, the ratio of PORH to LTH was significantly (P = 0.043) lower in patients with CF (55.3 ± 5.1%) than control subjects (68.8 ± 3.1%). Significant positive correlations between LTH and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%predicted) (r = 0.441, P = 0.013) and between the PORH-to-LTH ratio and exercise capacity (r = 0.350, P = 0.049) were observed. These data provide evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with CF compared with control subjects.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multisystemic disorder with broad clinical manifestations apart from the well-characterized pulmonary dysfunction. Recent findings have described impairment in conduit vessel function in patients with CF; however, whether microvascular function is affected in this population has yet to be elucidated. Using laser-Doppler imaging, we evaluated microvascular function through postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), local thermal hyperemia (LTH), and iontophoresis with acetylcholine (ACh). PORH [518 ± 174% (CF) and 801 ± 125% (control), P = 0.039], LTH [1,338 ± 436% (CF) and 1,574 ± 620% (control), P = 0.045], and iontophoresis with ACh [416 ± 140% (CF) and 617 ± 143% (control), P = 0.032] were significantly lower in patients with CF than control subjects. In addition, the ratio of PORH to LTH was significantly (P = 0.043) lower in patients with CF (55.3 ± 5.1%) than control subjects (68.8 ± 3.1%). Significant positive correlations between LTH and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%predicted) (r = 0.441, P = 0.013) and between the PORH-to-LTH ratio and exercise capacity (r = 0.350, P = 0.049) were observed. These data provide evidence of microvascular dysfunction in patients with CF compared with control subjects. In addition, our data demonstrate a complex relationship between microvascular function and classical markers of disease severity (i.e., pulmonary function and exercise capacity) in CF.
27084975	Ictal crying	"The purpose of this study was to describe a series of patients with ictal crying to estimate its occurrence and characterize the clinical features and the underlying etiology. We retrospectively reviewed all the long-term video-EEG reports from Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center over a 12-year period (2004-2015) for the occurrence of the terms ""cry"" or ""sob"" or ""weep"" in the text body. All the extracted reports were reviewed, and patients with at least one episode of documented ictal crying at the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) were included in the study. During the study period, 5133 patients were investigated at our EMU. Thirty-two patients (0.6%) had at least one documented seizure accompanied by crying. Twenty-seven patients (26 women and one man) had psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), and five patients (0.1%) had epilepsy. Among patients with epileptic ictal crying, four patients had focal epilepsy (two had definite, and two had probable frontal lobe epilepsy), while one patient had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Ictal crying is a rare finding among patients evaluated at the EMUs. The most common underlying etiology for ictal crying is PNES. However, ictal crying is not a specific sign for PNES. Epileptic ictal crying is often a rare type of partial seizure in patients with focal epilepsy. Dacrystic seizures do not provide clinical value in predicting localization of the epileptogenic zone."

27146408	Characterization of mitochondrial function in cells with impaired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function	"Evidence supporting the occurrence of oxidative stress in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is well established and the literature suggests that oxidative stress is inseparably linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we have characterized mitochondrial function, in particular as it regards the steps of oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production, in airway cells either homozygous for the F508del-CFTR allele or stably expressing wt-CFTR. We find that oxygen consumption, ΔΨ generation, adenine nucleotide translocator-dependent ADP/ATP exchange and both mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities are impaired in CF cells, while both mitochondrial ROS production and membrane lipid peroxidation increase. Importantly, treatment of CF cells with the small molecules VX-809 and 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin, which act as ""correctors"" for F508del CFTR by rescuing the F508del CFTR-dependent chloride secretion, while having no effect per sè on mitochondrial function in wt-CFTR cells, significantly improved all the above mitochondrial parameters towards values found in the airway cells expressing wt-CFTR. This novel study on mitochondrial bioenergetics provides a springboard for future research to further understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the involvement of mitochondria in CF and identify the proteins primarily responsible for the F508del-CFTR-dependent mitochondrial impairment and thus reveal potential novel targets for CF therapy."	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

27168866	Review of diagnostic uses of shunt fraction quantification with technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin perfusion scan as illustrated by a case of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome	Bilateral pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare and are often associated with the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT/Osler-Weber-Rendu) syndrome. We present a woman who presented with neurological symptoms due to a cerebral abscess. On further evaluation, bilateral pulmonary AVMs were identified. The patient was diagnosed with HHT, based on positive family history and multiple cerebral AVMs recognized on subsequent catheter angiogram, in addition to the presence of bilateral pulmonary AVMs. Craniotomy with drainage of the brain abscess and endovascular embolization of the pulmonary AVMs was offered to the patient. As a preembolization work-up, the patient underwent nuclear lung perfusion scan with technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m MAA) to assess the right-to-left shunt secondary to the pulmonary AVMs. Postembolization follow-up perfusion scan was also obtained to estimate the hemodynamic response. The case is presented to describe the role of Tc-99m MAA perfusion lung scan in preoperatively evaluating patients with pulmonary AVMs and to emphasize on the scan's utility in posttreatment follow-up. Various present day usages of the Tc-99m MAA lung perfusion scan, other than diagnosing pulmonary thromboembolism, are discussed. Providing background knowledge on the physiological and hemodynamic aspects of the Tc-99m MAA lung perfusion scan is also attempted.

The treatment outcomes are still unsatisfied. Our previous study of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children with focal epilepsy showed significant reduction in epileptiform discharges. We hypothesized that cathodal tDCS when applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) combined with pharmacologic treatment will be more effective for reducing seizure frequency in patients with LGS than pharmacologic treatment alone. Study participants were randomized to receive either (1) pharmacologic treatment with five consecutive days of 2 mA cathodal tDCS over M1 for 20 min or (2) pharmacologic treatment plus sham tDCS. Measures of seizure frequency and epileptic discharges were performed before treatment and again immediately post-treatment and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week follow-up. Twenty-two patients with LGS were enrolled. Participants assigned to the active tDCS condition reported significantly more pre- to post-treatment reductions in seizure frequency and epileptic discharges that were sustained for 3 weeks after treatment. Five consecutive days of cathodal tDCS over M1 combined with pharmacologic treatment appears to reduce seizure frequency and epileptic discharges. Further studies of the potential mechanisms of tDCS in the LGS are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02731300 (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov).	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

27216780	Asymmetric dimethylarginine and related metabolites in exhaled breath condensate of children with cystic fibrosis	Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) competitively inhibits nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Its levels in specimens from murine models and asthmatic patients are related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) reportedly have higher arginase activity, lower NO production and NOS expression than healthy controls. The objective was to assess the role of ADMA and related metabolites as disease biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of pediatric CF patients, compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC). A longitudinal design was conceived and 34 CF patients (21 stable, 13 at the onset of exacerbation) and 16 HC were enrolled. All CF patients underwent clinical examination, spirometry and EBC collection at enrolment; the same tests were performed also after an antibiotic course in those patients with exacerbation. Metabolites levels in EBC were measured with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry technique. All CF patients had ADMA levels (expressed as ratio to tyrosine) similar to those in HC (median 0.0112, IQR 0.0103-0.0120 and median 0.0114, IQR 0.0090-0.0128, respectively; P = 0.983), while a significant increase in the citrulline/tyrosine ratio was found in CF patients (median 0.6419, IQR 0.5738-0.6899 in CF vs median 0.4176, IQR 0.2986-0.5082 in HC; P = 0.00003). No differences in ADMA levels emerged between stable patients and those with exacerbation. ADMA and related aminoacids were measured simultaneously for the first time in EBC from CF patients. Higher citrulline/tyrosine ratios were found in CF children with normal ADMA levels, suggesting a dysregulated ADMA metabolism in these patients.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

27244789	Pubertal Height Growth and Adult Height in Cystic Fibrosis After Newborn Screening	To examine long-term growth benefit of newborn screening (NBS), adolescent peak height velocity (PHV), and adult height were compared between the screened (diagnosed early via NBS) and the control (identified generally by symptoms) in the Wisconsin Randomized Clinical Trial. Data from 107 children born in 1985-1994 and followed through 2012 were analyzed. PHV was estimated by a semiparametric growth curve model and compared with Tanner reference. Meconium ileus (MI; n = 25) was associated with the worst pubertal growth and adult height, including 1 child who did not experience apparent PHV; children with pancreatic sufficiency (n = 18) achieved the best growth (normal PHV and adult height). In children with pancreatic insufficiency without meconium ileus (n = 64), the subgroup most likely to benefit from NBS, screened children had similar PHV but better adult height compared with controls. Specifically, in boys, the screened group (n = 22) achieved normal PHV (9.5 cm at 13.5 years); the control group (n = 19) had similar onset age (13.6 years) but 0.6-cm lower magnitude (P = .08). In girls, the screened group (n = 10) had somewhat later (12.5 years vs 11.7 years, P = .12) and lower PHV (7.3 cm vs 7.9 cm, P = .33) than the controls (n = 13), coinciding with later menarche (13.6 years vs 12.2 years, P = .10). Adult height was taller in the screened than the control (50th vs 29th percentile, P = .02), even after adjusted for genetic potential (32nd vs15th percentile, P = .006). Differences in adult height were primarily attributable to NBS and better prepubertal growth. Early linear growth benefits of NBS were sustained through puberty, leading to better adult height in cystic fibrosis.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

It is unclear whether the same is true for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). To determine in children with PCD treated with intravenous antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation: (1) the proportion who recover to baseline forced expiratory volume at 1 sec (FEV1 ) within 3 months after treatment and (2) to try to identify factors which are associated with failure to regain pre-exacerbation FEV1 . Cohort study using the PCD database for children at the Royal Brompton Hospital, 2003-2013. We selected the first pulmonary exacerbation treated with intravenous antibiotics. The best FEV1 within 3 months after treatment was compared to the best FEV1 in the 12 months before treatment (baseline). Recovery to baseline was defined as any FEV1 after treatment that was greater than or equal to 90% of the baseline FEV1 . 32/150 children (21%) had at least one pulmonary exacerbation. 23/30 (77%) regained baseline spirometry within 3 months of treatment. There was no difference between responders and non-responders in any baseline characteristics. Around 25% of children with PCD fail to recover to baseline lung function within 3 months following treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation, similar to CF. Better treatment strategies are needed, and the results also suggest that prevention of exacerbations would be a useful end-point in clinical trials.

27309270	Growth Status and Its Relationship with Serum Lipids and Albumin in Children with Cystic Fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease, which affects many organs as it impairs chloride channel. This study was performed to evaluate growth status and its relationship with some laboratory indices such as Cholesterol (chol), Triglyceride (TG), albumin and total protein in children with CF referred to pediatrics center. This study was designed as a cross-sectional study in one year section. Demographic features were compared with standard percentiles curves. Chol, TG, albumin, total protein, prothrombin time, and hemoglobin were measured. Stool exams were also performed. A questionnaire was designed to obtain a history of the first presentation of disease, birth weight, type of labor and parent relativity. In 52% of patients, failure to thrive (FTT) was the first presentation. Steatorrhea and respiratory infections were the first presentations, which were seen in 13.7% and 33% of the cases, respectively. The weight of 88% of patients was below the 15th percentile while 82% had a height percentile below 15th. Head circumference in 53% of patients was below the 15th percentile. There was a significant association between weight percentile and serum albumin and total protein (P=0.03 and P=0.007, respectively). There was also a significant relationship between height percentile and serum albumin and total protein (P<0.001 and P<0.000, respectively). The relationships between head circumference and serum albumin and total protein were also significant (P=0.006 and P<0.000, respectively). There was also a significant association between height percentile and hemoglobin. The decrease in anthropometric percentiles leads to decreased serum albumin and total protein.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

27323484	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome): clinical manifestations and multidisciplinary management	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Osler- Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may lead to severe complications. The diagnosis of HHT is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease, and the variety of clinical manifestations. The management of HHT includes systematic screening for visceral AVMs at regular intervals, preventive interventions to reduce the risk of complications, and symptomatic measures. A multidisciplinary standardized program in specialised centers may improve the management of patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			122	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome): clinical manifestations and multidisciplinary management.

27334082	A pregnant patient with spontaneous haemothorax: hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia in pregnancy	The incidence of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT - Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) in the Netherlands is 1:5000 but approximately 1:1300 in people from the Antilles. The disease is characterised by the development of telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that may result in serious morbidity and mortality. A 31-year-old primigravid patient consulted her general practitioner at 31 1/7 weeks gestational age **with dyspnoea. She was referred for further diagnostics because of suspected pulmonary embolism. A CT scan showed haemothorax and a bleeding arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the left lung. Family history suggested the possibility of HHT**. After multidisciplinary consideration, **a primary caesarean section was performed, followed by embolisation of the AVM during the same surgical session**. The patient had a gene mutation consistent with HHT type 2. Pregnant patients with HHT are at risk of serious morbidity, especially if they are not screened for AVMs. A multidisciplinary approach for such patients, with consideration of various scenarios, is highly recommended.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

27363778	Dynamin 1 isoform roles in a mouse model of severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy	"Dynamin 1 is a large neuron-specific GTPase involved in the endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 1 (DNM1) underlie two epileptic encephalopathy syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Mice homozygous for the Dnm1 ""fitful"" mutation, a non-synonymous coding variant in an alternatively spliced exon of Dnm1 (exon 10a; isoform designation: Dnm1a(Ftfl)) have an epileptic encephalopathy-like disorder including lethal early onset seizures, locomotor and neurosensory deficits. Although fitful heterozygotes have milder recurrent seizures later in life, suggesting an additive or semi-dominant mechanism, the molecular etiology must also consider the fact that Dnm1a(Ftfl) exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in vitro. Another complication is that the fitful mutation induces alterations in the relative abundance of Dnm1 splice variants; mutants have a downregulation of Dnm1a and an upregulation of Dnm1b, changes which may contribute to the epileptic pathology. To examine whether Dnm1a loss of function, Dnm1a(Ftfl) dominance or compensation by Dnm1b is the most critical for severe seizures, we studied alternate isoform-specific mutant mice. Mice lacking Dnm1 exon 10a or Dnm1 exon 10b have neither spontaneous seizures nor other overt abnormalities, suggesting that in normal conditions the major role of each isoform is redundant. However, in the presence of Dnm1a(Ftfl) only exon 10a deleted mice experience severe seizures. These results reveal functional differences between Dnm1a and Dnm1b isoforms in the presence of a challenge, i.e. toxic Dnm1(Ftfl), while reinforcing its effect explicitly in this model of severe pediatric epilepsy."

27379172	Automatic Identification of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Secondary Generalized Epilepsy	Ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) are characteristic signal patterns of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded from patients with epilepsy, which assist with the diagnosis and characterization of various types of epilepsy. The EEG signal, however, is often recorded from patients with epilepsy for a long period of time, and thus detection and identification of EDs have been a burden on medical doctors. **This paper proposes a new method for automatic identification of two types of EDs, repeated sharp-waves (sharps), and runs of sharp-and-slow-waves (SSWs), which helps to pinpoint epileptogenic foci in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS**). In the experiments with iEEG data acquired from a patient with LGS, our proposed method detected EDs with an accuracy of 93.76% and classified three different signal patterns with a mean classification accuracy of 87.69%, which was significantly higher than that of a conventional wavelet-based method. Our study shows that it is possible to successfully detect and discriminate sharps and SSWs from background EEG activity using our proposed method.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

27392921	Suivi thérapeutique pharmacologique du felbamate	Felbamate is a derivative of meprobamate used in second-line partial epilepsy and in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Felbamate is well absorbed and has linear kinetics: Cmax and AUC increasing linearly with dose. The metabolism takes place in the liver. Metabolites represent 40 to 60% of excretion and are eliminated via the urine. The half-life is between 15 and 23 hours. Clearance is dependent on renal function. There is a concentration - efficacy and concentration - toxicity relationship. These arguments are in favour of a TDM but the therapeutic range is not clearly established. Potentially fatal side effects can be caused by felbamate (aplastic anemia, acute liver failure), which limits its use because they are dose-independant.

Lumacaftor improves the processing of F508del CFTR and its transport to the cell surface, while ivacaftor increases the channel's open probability and transport of chloride. In two 24-week trials in the approved patient population (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT), lumacaftor 400 mg plus ivacaftor 250 mg, administered every 12 h in combination with standard therapy, was associated with an ≈3 % statistically significant improvement in lung function relative to placebo (as measured by the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s). Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor did not significantly improve respiratory symptoms, although reduced pulmonary exacerbations to a clinically meaningful extent and, in one trial (TRANSPORT), significantly improved body mass index (BMI). In an ongoing extension of these studies (PROGRESS), lumacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinical benefit over a further 72 weeks of treatment. Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor had an acceptable tolerability profile, with the most common adverse events being respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature. Thus, lumacaftor/ivacaftor expands the treatment options available for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, although its precise place in clinical practice remains to be determined.	cystic fibrosis			282	Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor: A Review in Cystic Fibrosis.

27424345	Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: importance of a multidisciplinary approach	The Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Its main manifestations are nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding due to angiodysplasia. The presence of arteriovenous malformations in organs such as lung, liver, brain, etc. can cause serious complications (haemorrhage, stroke, brain abscess, hypoxemia, increased cardiac output, pulmonary arterial hypertension). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and can be confirmed by genetic analysis. The prevalence of this rare disease is 1/5,000 to 1/10,000 and its expression varies widely, even in the same family. The management must be multidisciplinary and based on prevention and treatment of bleeding complications as well as screening and treatment of arteriovenous malformations.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia			141	Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: importance of a multidisciplinary approach.

27440131	Update on Clinical Strategies in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia from an ENT Point of View	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations with an absence of capillaries between arteries and veins. One major manifestation site is the nasal mucous membrane where recurrent nosebleeds occur. Our clinical strategy to treat patients with HHT has the aim to reduce nasal bleeding long-term with minimal local and general side effects. We describe staged diagnosis and therapy including individual medical treatments of 97 patients with HHT. The success of treatment is monitored with a systematic questionnaire. The neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy remains standard treatment of choice with no major side effects despite the need for repeated treatment. In addition new treatment strategies like nasal occlusion, local drug therapy, and nasal septal splinting show initial success. Improvement of the quality of life of HHT patients can be achieved by a multimodal concept. Several new treatment strategies like nasal septal splinting and nasal occlusion successfully expand the range of established methods. Further studies have to prove the safety and long-term effectiveness of the described individual medical treatments.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

27466475	Surgical treatment of pediatric focal cortical dysplasia: Clinical spectrum and surgical outcome	To analyze the clinical presentation and outcomes of surgically treated focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in children. We reviewed 75 cases of confirmed FCD by pathology after resective surgery. We used the pathologic classification proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy and included clinical profile and seizure and neurodevelopmental outcomes in analyses. There were 11 cases of FCD type I, 34 of type IIa, 19 of type IIb, and 11 of type III. Fifty-one cases (68.0%) presented clinically as focal epilepsy (FE) and 24 (32.0%) as epileptic encephalopathy (EE), including 16 with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 8 with West syndrome. We observed EE in 7 cases (63.6%) in FCD type I, 14 (41.2%) in type IIa, 2 (10.5%) in type IIb, and 1 (9.1%) in type III. We found the following more frequently in EE: seizure onset occurring at younger than 2 years (EE: 20 [83.3%], FE: 19 [37.3%]; p < 0.001), presence of intellectual disability before surgery (EE: 22 [91.7%], FE: 29 [56.9%]; p = 0.003), and multilobar resections (EE: 19 [79.2%], FE: 15 [29.4%]; p < 0.001). Forty-eight cases (64.0%) were seizure-free; 66.7% (34/51) in FE, 58.3% (14/24) in EE. Neurodevelopmental level showed more improvement (11/48 vs 0/27, p = 0.011) and less deterioration (2/48 vs 9/27, p = 0.001) in the seizure-free group compared to the non-seizure-free group.

27475280	Ketogenic diet treatment for pediatric super-refractory status epilepticus	We aimed to study whether ketogenic diet (KD) therapy leads to resolution of super-refractory status epilepticus in pediatric patients without significant harm. A retrospective review was performed at Phoenix Children's Hospital on patients with super-refractory status epilepticus undergoing ketogenic diet therapy from 2011 to 2015. Ten children with super-refractory status epilepticus, ages 2-16 years, were identified. 4/10 patients had immune mediated encephalitis, including Rasmussen encephalitis, anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis, and post-infectious mycoplasma encephalitis. Other etiologies included Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, PCDH19 and GABRG2 genetic epilepsy, New Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus, and Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome. 4/10 patients' EEG features suggested focal with status epilepticus, and 6/10 suggested generalized with status epilepticus. Median hospital length was 61days and median ICU length was 27days. The median number of antiepileptic medications prior to diet initiation was 3.0 drugs, and the median after ketogenic diet treatment was 3.5 drugs. Median duration of status epilepticus prior to KD was 18days. 9/10 patients had resolution of super-refractory status epilepticus in a median of 7days after diet initiation. 8/9 patients were weaned off anesthesia within 15days of diet initiation, and within 1day of achieving ketonuria. 1/10 patients experienced side effects on the diet requiring supplementation. Most patients achieved resolution of status epilepticus on KD therapy, suggesting it could be an effective therapy that can be utilized early in the treatment of children with super refractory status epilepticus.

Many epileptic conditions, especially those affecting children, are rare disorders generating an urgent medical need for more efficacious therapy options. Therefore, we assessed the output of the US and European orphan drug legislations. Quantitative analysis of the FDA and EMA databases for orphan drug designations according to STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Within the US Orphan Drug Act 40 designations were granted delivering nine approvals, i.e. clobazam, diazepam viscous solution for rectal administration, felbamate, fosphenytoin, lamotrigine, repository corticotropin, rufinamide, topiramate, and vigabatrin. Since 2000 the EMA granted six orphan drug designations whereof two compounds were approved, i.e. rufinamide and stiripentol. In the US, two orphan drug designations were withdrawn. Orphan drugs were approved for conditions including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, Dravet syndrome, and status epilepticus. Comparing time to approval for rufinamide, which was approved in the US and the EU to treat rare seizure conditions, the process seems faster in the EU (2.2 years) than in the US (4.3 years). Orphan drug development in the US and in the EU delivered only few molecular entities to treat rare seizure disorders. The development programs focused on already approved antiepileptic drugs or alternative pharmaceutical formulations. Most orphan drugs approved in the US are not approved in the EU to treat rare seizures although some were introduced after 2000 when the EU adopted the Orphan Drug Regulation.

27582639	Effects of Reusing Gel Electrophoresis and Electrotransfer Buffers on Western Blotting	SDS-PAGE and Western blotting are 2 of the most commonly used biochemical methods for protein analysis. Proteins are electrophoretically separated based on their MWs by SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred to a solid membrane surface for subsequent protein-specific analysis by immunoblotting, a procedure commonly known as Western blotting. Both of these procedures use a salt-based buffer, with the latter procedure consisting of methanol as an additive known for its toxicity. Previous reports present a contradictory view in favor or against reusing electrotransfer buffer, also known as Towbin's transfer buffer (TTB), with an aim to reduce the toxic waste. In this report, we present a detailed analysis of not only reusing TTB but also gel electrophoresis buffer (EB) on proteins of low to high MW range. Our results suggest that EB can be reused for at least 5 times without compromising the electrophoretic separation of mixture of proteins in an MW standard, BSA, and crude cell lysates. Additionally, reuse of EB did not affect the quality of subsequent Western blots. Successive reuse of TTB, on the other hand, diminished the signal of proteins of different MWs in a protein standard and a high MW membrane protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) in Western blotting.	cystic fibrosis			239	Effects of Reusing Gel Electrophoresis and Electrotransfer Buffers on Western Blotting.

Previous reports present a contradictory view in favor or against reusing electrotransfer buffer, also known as Towbin's transfer buffer (TTB), with an aim to reduce the toxic waste. In this report, we present a detailed analysis of not only reusing TTB but also gel electrophoresis buffer (EB) on proteins of low to high MW range. Our results suggest that EB can be reused for at least 5 times without compromising the electrophoretic separation of mixture of proteins in an MW standard, BSA, and crude cell lysates. Additionally, reuse of EB did not affect the quality of subsequent Western blots. Successive reuse of TTB, on the other hand, diminished the signal of proteins of different MWs in a protein standard and a high MW membrane protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) in Western blotting.
27590641	Approach to the evaluation of adverse antibiotic reactions in patients with cystic fibrosis	Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antibiotics in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are common and often mislabeled as allergies. The labeling of an antibiotic reaction as an allergy can lead to the use of antibiotics that are less efficacious, are more expensive, or have a greater risk of adverse effects. To establish a safe approach for the evaluation of ADRs to antibiotics in patients with CF to help clarify future use of these medications. Patients with CF whose antibiotic allergies were causing difficulty in their medical management were referred for an allergy evaluation that consisted of a thorough drug allergy history and antibiotic testing if appropriate. If the history was not consistent with a true hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and test results were negative, the patient underwent a challenge to the offending agent(s) to rule out an HSR. Challenges were only performed if the medication was indicated for future use. A total of 17 patients (mean age, 32.4 years) underwent a thorough allergy evaluation. A total of 17 antibiotic challenges were performed in 11 patients without a reaction consistent with an HSR or severe delayed reaction. Only 2 medications had a history consist with an HSR, and it was recommended that they undergo a desensitization procedure if the drug was required. If treatment with appropriate antibiotics becomes difficult in patients with CF because of drug allergies, then referral to an allergist can help safely identify treatment options. Our findings suggest that a thorough evaluation by an allergy specialist can lead to more appropriate treatment options in patients with CF.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

27599328	Effect of Bevacizumab Nasal Spray on Epistaxis Duration in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangectasia: A Randomized Clinical Trial	Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT**. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility)**. Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period. Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group. Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment. Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = .57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1-436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8-406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8-327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3-291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee. In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02106520.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish translation of CFQ-R in adults. A total of 173 CF patients answered the CFQ-R. The CFQ-R was evaluated with regard to: (1) distributional properties; (2) reliability; and (3) construct validity. The majority of scales were negatively skewed with ceiling effects. Eight of the 12 scales had satisfactory homogeneity; 10 of the 12 scales had satisfactory test-retest reliability. On many of the CFQ-R scales expected differences were observed when patients were divided regarding disease severity, nutritional status, age, and gender. Some weaknesses were detected, but overall the instrument has satisfactory psychometric properties.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

27629435	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator controls biliary epithelial inflammation and permeability by regulating Src tyrosine kinase activity	In the liver, the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulates bile secretion and other functions at the apical membrane of biliary epithelial cells (i.e., cholangiocytes). CF-related liver disease is a major cause of death in patients with CF. CFTR dysfunction affects innate immune pathways, generating a para-inflammatory status in the liver and other epithelia. This study investigates the mechanisms linking CFTR to toll-like receptor 4 activity. We found that CFTR is associated with a multiprotein complex at the apical membrane of normal mouse cholangiocytes, with proteins that negatively control Rous sarcoma oncogene cellular homolog (Src) activity. In CFTR-defective cholangiocytes, Src tyrosine kinase self-activates and phosphorylates toll-like receptor 4, resulting in activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in response to endotoxins. This Src/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells-dependent inflammatory process attracts inflammatory cells but also generates changes in the apical junctional complex and loss of epithelial barrier function. Inhibition of Src decreased the inflammatory response of CF cholangiocytes to lipopolysaccharide, rescued the junctional defect in vitro, and significantly attenuated endotoxin-induced biliary damage and inflammation in vivo (Cftr knockout mice). These findings reveal a novel function of CFTR as a regulator of toll-like receptor 4 responses and cell polarity in biliary epithelial cells; this mechanism is pathogenetic, as shown by the protective effects of Src inhibition in vivo, and may be a novel therapeutic target in CF-related liver disease and other inflammatory cholangiopathies.

27640901	Immediate and Catastrophic Antibody-Mediated Rejection in a Lung Transplant Recipient With Anti-Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 and Anti-Endothelin-1 Receptor Type A Antibodies	Preexisting donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) have been associated with reduced survival of lung allografts. However, antibodies with specificities other than HLA may have a detrimental role on the lung transplant outcome. A young man with cystic fibrosis underwent lung transplantation with organs from a suitable deceased donor. At the time of transplantation, there were no anti-HLA DSAs. During surgery, the patient developed a severe and intractable pulmonary hypertension associated with right ventriular dysfunction, which required arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. After a brief period of clinical improvement, a rapid deterioration in hemodynamics led to the patient's death on postoperative day 5. Postmortem studies showed that lung specimens taken at the end of surgery were compatible with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), while terminal samples evidenced diffuse capillaritis, blood extravasation, edema, and microthrombi, with foci of acute cellular rejection (A3). Immunological investigations demonstrated the presence of preexisting antibodies against the endothelin-1 receptor type A (ETA R) and the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 R), two of the most potent vasoconstrictors reported to date, whose levels slightly rose after transplantation. These data suggest that preexisting anti-ETA R and anti-AT1 R antibodies may have contributed to the onset of AMR and to the catastrophic clinical course of this patient.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

27646277	Defective fluid shear stress mechanotransduction mediates hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Morphogenesis of the vascular system is strongly modulated by mechanical forces from blood flow. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal-dominant disease in which arteriovenous malformations and telangiectasias accumulate with age. Most cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in Alk1 or Endoglin, receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 9 and 10. Evidence suggests that a second hit results in clonal expansion of endothelial cells to form lesions with poor mural cell coverage that spontaneously rupture and bleed. We now report that fluid shear stress potentiates BMPs to activate Alk1 signaling, which correlates with enhanced association of Alk1 and endoglin. Alk1 is required for BMP9 and flow responses, whereas endoglin is only required for enhancement by flow. This pathway mediates both inhibition of endothelial proliferation and recruitment of mural cells; thus, its loss blocks flow-induced vascular stabilization. Identification of Alk1 signaling as a convergence point for flow and soluble ligands provides a molecular mechanism for development of HHT lesions.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

27683846	Deconstructing tolerance with clobazam: Post hoc analyses from an open-label extension study	To evaluate potential development of tolerance to adjunctive clobazam in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients enrolled in open-label extension study OV-1004, which continued until clobazam was commercially available in the United States or for a maximum of 2 years outside the United States. Enrolled patients started at 0.5 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) clobazam, not to exceed 40 mg/d. After 48 hours, dosages could be adjusted up to 2.0 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) (maximum 80 mg/d) on the basis of efficacy and tolerability. Post hoc analyses evaluated mean dosages and drop-seizure rates for the first 2 years of the open-label extension based on responder categories and baseline seizure quartiles in OV-1012. Individual patient listings were reviewed for dosage increases ≥40% and increasing seizure rates. Data from 200 patients were included. For patients free of drop seizures, there was no notable change in dosage over 24 months. For responder groups still exhibiting drop seizures, dosages were increased. Weekly drop-seizure rates for 100% and ≥75% responders demonstrated a consistent response over time. Few patients had a dosage increase ≥40% associated with an increase in seizure rates. Two-year findings suggest that the majority of patients do not develop tolerance to the antiseizure actions of clobazam. Observed dosage increases may reflect best efforts to achieve seizure freedom. It is possible that the clinical development of tolerance to clobazam has been overstated. NCT00518713 and NCT01160770.

27784762	DNA-fragmentation is a source of bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is common in cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease also characterized by abundant extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the airways. The eDNA is mainly derived from neutrophils accumulating in the airways and contributes to a high sputum viscosity. The altered environment in the lower airways also paves the way for chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we show that mice with P. aeruginosa airway infection have increased survival and decreased bacterial load after topical treatment with DNase. Furthermore, DNA from the sputum of CF patients showed increased bactericidal activity after treatment with DNase ex vivo. Both degraded DNA of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and genomic DNA degraded by serum, acquired bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa In vitro, small synthetic DNA-fragments (<100 base pairs) but not large fragments nor genomic DNA, were bactericidal against Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of divalent cations reduced bacterial killing, suggesting that chelation of divalent cations by DNA results in destabilization of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) envelope. This is a novel antibacterial strategy where fragmentation of eDNA and DNA-fragments can be used to treat P. aeruginosa airway infection.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Cellular models were used in conjunction with data from a recent CF genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to determine modulators of ER stress-mediated inflammation. Surprisingly, cells undergoing ER stress during inflammatory stimulation showed reduced interleukin 8 (IL-8) and CXCL1 secretion (P < .001). Neutralization of CXCL1 and IL-8 reduced neutrophil chemotaxis >50% to supernatants from IL-1β-stimulated CF airway epithelial cells (P < .01). The clinical importance of these chemokines was validated by association of CXCL1 and IL8 polymorphisms with changes in lung disease severity in patients with CF (n = 6365; IL8, P = .001; CXCL1, P = .001), confirming that targeting these chemokine pathways could help improve lung disease. We determined that production of these chemokines was partially controlled by ER stress in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent manner, whereby ER stress inhibited STAT3 activation. Our findings support a role for CXCL1 and IL-8 in CF lung disease severity and identify STAT3 as a modulating pathway. Targeting these pathways may help improve health outcomes in CF.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

27846468	Therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) on the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and explore the relationships between EEG changes and clinical efficacy. We retrospectively studied 47 patients with LGS who accepted KD therapy between May 2011 and May 2015. Clinical efficacy and EEG features such as background activity, abnormal interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) and the discharge location were evaluated prior to and at 3 and 6 months after therapy. Responders were defined as ≥50% seizure reduction. At 3 months of treatment, 23 patients (48.9%) had ≥50% seizure reduction. Seven patients (14.9%) discontinued treatment between 3 and 6 months because of lack of efficacy or inability to adhere to the diet. At 6 months of treatment, 4 patients (10%) were seizure free, 5 (12.5%) had ≥90% seizure reduction, 12 (30%) had a reduction of 50-89%, and 19 (47.5%) had <50% reduction. Patients with improved EEG background and reduced IEDs had an improved seizure reduction rate compared with patients without change in EEG background or IEDs (p<0.01). The results show that the KD is effective in LGS. It can control seizures and improve EEG abnormalities. Early improvement in the EEG background and a reduction in IEDs may be predictors of a patient's response to diet.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

27861387	Open arterial reconstruction of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A case report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs. A 62-year-old female with known HHT was referred to our facility to seek further treatment for a giant HAA. She denied any symptoms except recurrent epistaxis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right HAA with a diameter of 72 mm, in addition to 2 other minor HAAs. The CT scan also revealed the VMs that were scattered in the liver, and a continuously dilated and tortuous artery existing from the celiac trunk to the right and left hepatic arteries. We performed open arterial reconstruction of the HAAs. Her postoperative course was uneventful. When treating HAAs, there are a variety of options. However, hepatic VMs might affect HHT patients in various ways postprocedurally. Ligation and embolization of the hepatic artery may lead to complications, such as massive hepatic necrosis. Hepatectomy should be avoided if possible, because a postoperative hyperperfusive state in the remaining liver can cause adverse events. We believe that arterial reconstruction of HHT-associated HAAs might reduce the risk of postprocedural complications with minimal hemodynamic changes in the liver, thus obviating the need for hepatectomy or liver transplantation.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		330	Open arterial reconstruction of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A case report. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral vascular malformations (VMs). Liver involvement with VMs may lead to high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, and biliary disease. There is no curative treatment for the disease, and liver transplantation is indicated for life-threatening complications. Herein, we report a case of multiple hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) in a patient with HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was performed. There have only been a few case reports on HAA occurring with HHT. Thus, this case provides important information for the management of HHT-associated HAAs.

27878613	Intermittent low-dose bevacizumab in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia : A case report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited autosomal dominant disease presenting with recurrent bleeding episodes and iron deficiency anemia due to vascular malformations. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with an increased risk of stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary hypertension and life expectancy is significantly reduced. Excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we report about a male patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presenting with pulmonary and central nervous system involvement experiencing repetitive nosebleeds, necessitating frequent local cauterization and transfusion of more than 100 units of packed red blood cells. After initiation of temporary therapy with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab at a dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight every 2 weeks, the nose bleeding episodes and the epistaxis severity score significantly decreased and long-lasting transfusion independence was achieved. Reinitiation of low-dose bevacizumab after relapse again proved effective without any documented therapy-related adverse events. In comparison to other reported anti-VEGF antibody protocols in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, our treatment approach proved to be cost-efficient. Intermittent low-dose therapy with bevacizumab represents an effective and cost-efficient treatment option for transfusion-dependent patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

27908697	Clostridium difficile carriage in adult cystic fibrosis (CF); implications for patients with CF and the potential for transmission of nosocomial infection	Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive, spore-forming, toxin-producing bacillus transmitted among humans through the faecal-oral route. Despite increasing carriage rates and the presence of C. difficile toxin in stool, patients with CF rarely appear to develop typical manifestations of C. difficile infection (CDI). In this study, we examined the carriage, toxin production, ribotype distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of C. difficile in a cohort of 60 adult patients with CF who were pre-lung transplant. C. difficile was detected in 50% (30/60) of patients with CF by culturing for the bacteria. C. difficile toxin was detected in 63% (19/30) of C. difficile-positive stool samples. All toxin-positive stool samples contained toxigenic C. difficile strains harbouring toxin genes, tcdA and tcdB. Despite the presence of C. difficile and its toxin in patient stool, no acute gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Ribotyping of C. difficile strains revealed 16 distinct ribotypes (RT), 11 of which are known to be disease-causing including the hyper-virulent RT078. Additionally, strains RT002, RT014, and RT015, which are common in non-CF nosocomial infection were described. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid and rifampicin. No correlation was observed between carriage of C. difficile or any characteristics of isolated strains and any recorded clinical parameters or treatment received. We demonstrate a high prevalence of hypervirulent, toxigenic strains of C. difficile in asymptomatic patients with CF. This highlights the potential role of asymptomatic patients with CF in nosocomial transmission of C. difficile.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

27925453	Chest computed tomography scores in patients with cystic fibrosis colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF), with increasing incidence in recent years. We examined the association between bacterial colonization in the sputum (MRSA with or without pseudomonas (PA)) and computed tomography (CT) scores in CF patients. MRSA patients were divided according to PA status based on at least three consecutive sputum cultures; controls were patients without MRSA (with or without PA), matched for gender and age at CT. Clinical data and CT scores were compared between groups. Of 33 patients with MRSA, 14 had no PA (MRSA + PA-) and 19 had also PA (MRSA + PA+). MRSA + PA- and MRSA + PA+ patients had CT scores similar to their controls PA+ (38.25 ± 20.18 vs. 32.22 ± 18.74, P = .4, and 41.88 ± 18.18 vs. 45.33 ± 11.5, P = .4, respectively). Although MRSA + PA- had worse CT scores than their matched PA- controls, their mean FEV1 values were similar. Colonization with MRSA in CF is associated with structural CT changes at least similar to those in PA. A cause and effect relationship cannot be established. The current findings call for a larger study assessing longitudinally the impact of MRSA acquisition and eradication protocols.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

27994367	Brainstem dysfunction in patients with late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics study	There have been a few reports of patients who developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in the second decades of their life. The aim of this study was to investigate electroclinical presentation in patients with late-onset LGS. In addition, we evaluated structural abnormalities of the brain, which may give some clue about the common pathogenic pathway in LGS. We enrolled the patients with late-onset LGS. We collected electroclinical characteristics of the patients and evaluated structural abnormalities using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. The three subjects were diagnosed with late-onset LGS. The patients have no mental retardation and normal background activities on electroencephalography (EEG), and they had generalized paroxysmal fast activities on EEG, especially during sleep. The TBSS analysis revealed that fractional anisotropy values in the patients were significantly reduced in the white matter of brainstem compared with normal controls. However, VBM analysis did not show any significant difference between the patients and normal controls. Patients with late-onset LGS have different clinical and EEG characteristics from those with early-onset LGS. In addition, we demonstrated that brainstem dysfunction might contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

We adopted an industry-independent noninterventional retrospective evaluation on the basis of the paper and electronic records complemented by personal information on the part of the treating neurologists. All patients (N=26, 15 females, mean age: 30, range 21-55years) started on PER from its introduction to the market in September 2012 until December 15th 2013 were included. Evaluation was carried out after 6, 12, and 24months of PER treatment. Changes in seizure frequency were calculated as the number of seizures during three months on PER compared to a three-month baseline period. The Clinical Global Impression Scale served as an instrument to record changes in seizure intensity beyond numerical values. Adverse effects were documented by means of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile. Most patients had structural or metabolic epilepsy, 2 patients suffered from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 2 from other symptomatic generalized epilepsy. All patients had grade III drug-resistant epilepsy. All patients had additional cognitive deficits of different degree. The retention rates were 61.5% after 6months, 46.2% after 12months, and 42.3% after 24months. The responder rates were 11.5% after 6months, 23.1% after 12months, and 7.7% after 24months. Partial responders (positive CGI and/or seizure reduction <50%) included, the respective values were 26.9%, 38.5%, and 23.1%. Only 1 patient was seizure free at 12months (but not at 24months). A loss of efficacy in the second year of treatment was suspected but the decrease of the responder rate could also be ascribed to a number of different circumstances. Adverse effects in the psychiatric field like irritability, aggression, increased sensitivity, and suicidal ideation/behavior occurred in 50% of the patients. They were the main reason to discontinue PER. After one year of treatment PER showed reasonable efficacy in a particularly difficult-to-treat population. Psychiatric adverse effects forced discontinuation in many cases.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

28040058	Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in North Egyptian population: implications for the genetic diagnosis in Egypt	Cystic fibrosis (CF) occurrence in Arab populations is not common and still remains underidentified. Furthermore, the lack of disease awareness and diagnosis facilities have mislead the identification of cystic fibrosis for decades. The knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) in Egypt is very limited, and a few reports have drawn attention to the existence of CF or CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RDs) in the Egyptian population. Therefore a comprehensive genetic analysis of the CFTR gene was realized in patients of North Egypt. DNA samples of 56 Egyptian patients were screened for the CFTR gene mutations. The 27 exons and their flanking regions of the CFTR gene were amplified by PCR, using the published primer pairs, and were studied by automated direct DNA sequencing to detect disease-causing mutations. Moreover, large duplication/deletion was analysed by MLPA technique. CFTR screening revealed the identification of thirteen mutations including four novel ones: c.92G&gt;A (p.Arg31His), c.2782G&gt;C (p.Ala928Pro), c.3718-24G&gt;A, c.4207A&gt;G (p.Arg1403Gly) and nine previously reported mutations: c.454A&gt;T (p.Met152Leu), c.902A&gt;G (p.Tyr301Cys), c.1418delG, c.2620-15C&gt;G, c.2997\_3000delAATT, c.3154T&gt;G (p.Phe1052Val), c.3872A&gt;G (p.Gln1291Arg), c.3877G&gt;A (p.Val1293Ile), c.4242+10T&gt;C. Furthermore, eight polymorphisms were found: c.743+40A&gt;G, c.869+11C&gt;T, c.1408A&gt;G, c.1584G&gt;A, c.2562T&gt;G, c.3870A&gt;G, c.4272C&gt;T, c.4389G&gt;A. These mutations and polymorphisms were not previously described in the Egyptian population except for the c.1408A&gt;G polymorphism. Here we demonstrate the importance of the newly discovered mutations in Egyptian patients and the presence of CF, whereas the p.Phe508del mutation is not detected. The identification of CFTR mutations will become increasingly important in undocumented populations. The current findings will help us expand the mutational spectrum of CF and establish the first panel of the CFTR gene mutations in the Egyptian population and design an appropriate strategy for future genetic diagnosis of CF.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

The patient's bleeding had been refractory to repeated endoscopic interventions, tranexamic acid, and tamoxifen. However, following treatment with bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg every other week, nearly 300 units of packed red blood cell transfusions were avoided in one year's time. Despite its relatively high cost, bevacizumab may have a more active role in the management of severe GI bleeding in HHT if such remarkable response can be consistently demonstrated.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

We have previously reported that patients with Dravet syndrome present a very peculiar motor phenotype. Here we sought to confirm that this association was not linked to the chronic use of antiepileptic drugs or the many lifetime seizures. To this aim,** we studied 14 adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and 14 adults with Dravet syndrome because both conditions share similar seizure severity.** We found that antecollis and parkinsonian gait were significantly more common in the Dravet group, thus suggesting that these features are part of the Dravet syndrome adult phenotype.

28210578	Adjunctive use of electroconvulsive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and drug-resistant epilepsy: A pilot study	Background: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by drug-resistant multiple seizure types. The aim of this study was to determine if the adjunctive use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with LGS and drug-resistant epilepsy is efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency and also to investigate its safety and tolerability. Methods: This was an open-label pilot study with convenience sampling from one center. Bitemporal electrode placement was selected. ECT was administered three times per week for four weeks (considered as the induction phase), and then once a week for two months (considered as the maintenance phase). Follow-up visits were scheduled at 2, 3, 4, and 6 months to determine the seizure types and counts and also to determine the safety and tolerability of adjunctive use of ECT in these patients. All patients and / or their caregivers consented in writing to their participation. Results: Seven patients were studied. Just one patient experienced more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. One patient experienced more than 50% seizure increase with ECT. In three patients, there was an increase in aggressive behavior after receiving ECT. Two patients experienced mild and transient ataxia with ECT. One patient experienced mutism with ECT, which was transient and resolved with the termination of the procedure. Conclusion: In this small study, adjunctive use of an intensive ECT program in patients with LGS was not efficacious in decreasing their seizure frequency. However, the safety profile was acceptable, and patients tolerated the adjunctive use of ECT very well. This finding can pave the road for future investigations.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

28245352	The association of a probiotic with a prebiotic (Flortec, Bracco) to improve the quality/quantity of spermatozoa in infertile patients with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia: a pilot study	The hypothesis that the assumption of a probiotic associated with a prebiotic (Flortec, Bracco; one sachet contains: Lactobacillus paracasei B21060 5 × 10(9) cells + arabinogalctan 1243 mg + oligo-fructosaccharides 700 mg + l-glutamine 500 mg) could improve the quality and quantity of spermatozoa in idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia (iAOT) patients to a larger extent than a control substance (starch) was tested. Forty-one patients with no chromosomal aberrations were randomized into two groups: 20 received Flortec, one sachet per day for 6 months, whereas 21 received the control substance. The following data were collected: clinical history, scrotal Doppler scans, Y microdeletion, karyotype and cystic fibrosis screens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and prolactin (PRL) levels, and two semen analyses. Both the Flortec and the starch groups underwent two semen analyses and one FSH, LH, T, E2, and PRL measurement in the blood, at the beginning of the study, and after 6 months. The comparisons were carried out using a non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed rank) test. The side effects were assessed and compared using the chi-squared test. Group 1 (Flortec) had their sperm count improved: volume of the ejaculate (median from 2.4 to 3.1 mL; p < 0.01), sperm concentration (median: from 15.2 × 10(6) /mL to 28.3 × 10(6) /39 mL; p < 0.01), progressive motility (median: from 16.2 to 42.0%; p < 0.01), and the percentage of typical forms (median: from 7 to 16.3%; p < 0.01); in addition, their FSH, LH, and T levels improved (p < 0.01), while those of E2 and PRL did not. Group 2 (control substance) had no modification in 42 of the parameters studied. There were no side effects in either group. These data showed that Flortec constitutes a safe therapy for improving the volume of the ejaculate and the quality/quantity of spermatozoa in iOAT patients.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

28280235	The lower airway microbiota in early cystic fibrosis lung disease: a longitudinal analysis	In infants and young children with cystic fibrosis, lower airway infection and inflammation are associated with adverse respiratory outcomes. However, the role of lower airway microbiota in the pathogenesis of early cystic fibrosis lung disease remains uncertain. To assess the development of the lower airway microbiota over time in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis, and to explore its association with airway inflammation and pulmonary function at age 6 years. Serial, semi-annual bronchoscopies and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures were performed in infants newly diagnosed with cystic fibrosis following newborn screening. Quantitative microbiological cultures and inflammatory marker (interleukin 8 and neutrophil elastase) measurements were undertaken contemporaneously. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was conducted on stored BAL samples. Spirometry results recorded at 6 years of age were extracted from medical records. Ninety-five BAL samples provided 16S ribosomal RNA gene data. These were collected from 48 subjects aged 1.2-78.3 months, including longitudinal samples from 27 subjects and 13 before age 6 months. The lower airway microbiota varied, but diversity decreased with advancing age. Detection of recognised cystic fibrosis bacterial pathogens was associated with reduced microbial diversity and greater lower airway inflammation. There was no association between the lower airway microbiota and pulmonary function at age 6 years. In infants with cystic fibrosis, the lower airway microbiota is dynamic. Dominance of the microbiota by recognised cystic fibrosis bacterial pathogens is associated with increased lower airway inflammation, however early microbial diversity is not associated with pulmonary function at 6 years of age.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

28295228	Cognitive network reorganization following surgical control of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	We previously observed that adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) show abnormal functional connectivity among cognitive networks, suggesting that this may contribute to impaired cognition. Herein we report network reorganization following seizure remission in a child with LGS who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after resection of a cortical dysplasia. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired during presurgical fMRI. Presurgical and postsurgical functional connectivity were compared using (1) graph theoretical analyses of small-world network organization and node-wise strength; and (2) seed-based analyses of connectivity within and between five functional networks. To explore the specificity of these postsurgical network changes, connectivity was further compared to nine children with LGS who did not undergo surgery. The presurgical EEG-fMRI revealed diffuse activation of association cortex during interictal discharges. Following surgery and seizure control, functional connectivity showed increased small-world organization, stronger connectivity in subcortical structures, and greater within-network integration/between-network segregation. These changes suggest network improvement, and diverged sharply from the comparison group of nonoperated children. Following surgery, this child with LGS achieved seizure control and showed extensive reorganization of networks that underpin cognition. This case illustrates that the epileptic process of LGS can directly contribute to abnormal network organization, and that this network disruption may be reversible.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

28297555	Epistaxis grading in Osler's disease: comparison of comprehensive scores with detailed bleeding diaries	Use of reliable grading scores to measure epistaxis severity in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is essential in clinical routine and for scientific purposes. For practical reasons, visual analog scale (VAS) scoring and the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) are widely used. VAS scores are purely subjective, and a potential shortcoming of the ESS is that it is based on self-reported anamnestic bleeding data. The aim of this study was to validate the level of correlation between VAS scores, the ESS, and actual bleeding events, based on detailed epistaxis diaries of patients. Records from daily epistaxis diaries maintained by 16 HHT patients over 112 consecutive days were compared with the monthly ESS and daily VAS scores in the corresponding time period. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance models, and multiple R2 measures were used for statistical analysis. Although the ESS and VAS scores generally showed a high degree of correlation with actual bleeding events, mild events were underrepresented in both scores. Our results highlight the usefulness of the ESS as a standard epistaxis score in cohorts with moderate to severe degrees of epistaxis. The use of detailed epistaxis diaries should be considered when monitoring patients and cohorts with mild forms of HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

28392943	Report from a Survey of Parents Regarding the Use of Cannabidiol (Medicinal cannabis) in Mexican Children with Refractory Epilepsy	Structured online surveys were used to explore the experiences of the parents of children with refractory epilepsy using medicinal cannabis in Mexico during September 2016. The surveys, which were completed in full, were reviewed, and 53 cases of children aged between 9 months and 18 years were identified. Of these, 43 cases (82%) were from Mexico and 10 (18%) were from Latin American countries. Of the 43 Mexican cases, the diagnoses were as follows: 20 cases (47%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS); 13 cases (30%) had unspecified refractory epilepsy (URE); 8 cases (19%) had West syndrome (WS); 1 case (2%) had Doose syndrome (DS); and 1 case (2%) had Ohtahara syndrome (OS). In total, 47.1% of cases had previously been treated with 9 or more anticonvulsant therapies. The parents reported a decrease in convulsions when cannabidiol was used in 81.3% of the cases; a moderate to significant decrease occurred in 51% of cases, and 16% of cases were free from seizure. The number of antiepileptic drugs being used was reduced in 9/43 (20.9%) cases. No serious adverse effects were reported, with only some mild adverse effects, such as increased appetite or changes in sleep patterns, reported in 42% of cases.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

28406713	An Observational Study of Outcomes and Tolerances in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Initiated on Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor	In July 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lumacaftor/ivacaftor for use in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This drug targets the primary defect in the CFTR protein that is conferred by the F508del CFTR mutation. As there is limited experience with this therapy outside of clinical trials, this study aims to examine the clinical experience of this new drug in a population with CF. Retrospective cohort study of individuals followed at the Johns Hopkins CF Center who initiated treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients were followed from 1 year before drug initiation to up to 11 months postinitiation. Key exclusion criteria include previous exposure to lumacaftor/ivacaftor through participation in a clinical trial. Of 116 individuals identified who started lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment, 46 (39.7%) reported adverse effects related to lumacaftor/ivacaftor, with the vast majority (82.2%) being pulmonary adverse effects, and 20 (17.2%) discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor because of adverse effects. The mean change in FEV1% predicted was 0.11% (range: -39% to +20%; P = 0.9). Nineteen individuals had an FEV1% predicted of 40% or less before treatment, and there was a higher percentage of patients in this subgroup who reported adverse effects (57.9%) and a higher percentage of patients who discontinued lumacaftor/ivacaftor (31.6%). Female sex was associated with a higher odds of drug discontinuation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.12, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-9.38). This study highlights the prevalence of adverse effects in a CF population newly exposed to lumacaftor/ivacaftor and demonstrates a relatively high rate of drug intolerance.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

28455785	Hypertonic Saline as a Useful Tool for Sputum Induction and Pathogen Detection in Cystic Fibrosis	The aim of this study was to compare the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of pathogens in the airway secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the sputum induction capacity before and after inhalation of 7% hypertonic saline solution (HSS). The study enrolled 64 patients with CF. Airway secretions were collected from all enrolled patients with CF before and after inhalation of 7% HSS, and the samples were screened for pathogens. Inhalation of 7% HSS increased the probability of producing sputum from 36 to 52% (p = 0.002) in children with CF. The effect was most in children under 11 years. Inhalation of 7% HSS improved qualitative pathogen identification (p = 0.008). Inhalation of 7% HSS increased the mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002) and non-mucoid P. aeruginosa in the semi-quantitative analysis (p = 0.035). Four new pathogens (Aspergillus fumigatus, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Ochrobactrum anthropi, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica) were identified in the sputum samples collected from the airways of patients with CF following 7% HSS. Inhalation of 7% HSS increased sputum production and pathogen identification in children with CF. The inhalation of 7% HSS was feasible and should be implemented for routine pathogen detection in the airways of patients with CF, particularly in those patients who do not produce sputum.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

Patients with suspected LGS should be examined regularly because ophthalmological features can change during their disease course.
28479797	Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: A Prospective Follow-up Study	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy. In Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, seizures are resistant to pharmacological treatment. **In this prospective study, we evaluated the clinical features, neuroimaging, and response to treatment. **Forty-three consecutive newly diagnosed patients of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were enrolled in the study. Baseline clinical assessment included seizure semiology, seizure frequency, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Patients were treated with combinations of preferred antiepileptic drugs (sodium valproate [VPA], clobazam [CLB], levetiracetam [LVT], lamotrigine [LMT], and topiramate [TPM]). Patients were followed for 6 months. The outcome was assessed using modified Barthel index. Tonic and generalized tonic-clonic forms were the most common seizures types. Features suggestive of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (37.2%) were most frequent neuroimaging abnormality. Neuroimaging was normal in 32.6% of patients. With a combination valproic acid (VPA), CLB, and LVT, in 81.4% of patients, we were able to achieve >50% reduction in seizure frequency. Eleven (25.58%) patients showed an improvement in the baseline disability status. A combination of VPA, CLB, and LVT is an appropriate treatment regimen for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

28523349	Diagnosis of bronchiectasis and airway wall thickening in children with cystic fibrosis: Objective airway-artery quantification	To quantify airway and artery (AA)-dimensions in cystic fibrosis (CF) and control patients for objective CT diagnosis of bronchiectasis and airway wall thickness (AWT). Spirometer-guided inspiratory and expiratory CTs of 11 CF and 12 control patients were collected retrospectively. Airway pathways were annotated semi-automatically to reconstruct three-dimensional bronchial trees. All visible AA-pairs were measured perpendicular to the airway axis. Inner, outer and AWT (outer-inner) diameter were divided by the adjacent artery diameter to compute AinA-, AoutA- and AWTA-ratios. AA-ratios were predicted using mixed-effects models including disease status, lung volume, gender, height and age as covariates. Demographics did not differ significantly between cohorts. Mean AA-pairs CF: 299 inspiratory; 82 expiratory. 131 inspiratory; 58 expiratory. All ratios were significantly larger in inspiratory compared to expiratory CTs for both groups (p<0.001). AoutA- and AWTA-ratios were larger in CF than in controls, independent of lung volume (p<0.01). Difference of AoutA- and AWTA-ratios between patients with CF and controls increased significantly for every following airway generation (p<0.001). Diagnosis of bronchiectasis is highly dependent on lung volume and more reliably diagnosed using outer airway diameter. Difference in bronchiectasis and AWT severity between the two cohorts increased with each airway generation. • More peripheral airways are visible in CF patients compared to controls. • Structural lung changes in CF patients are greater with each airway generation. • Number of airways visualized on CT could quantify CF lung disease. • For objective airway disease quantification on CT, lung volume standardization is required.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

We observed that β1-integrins accumulate on the luminal membrane of upper-airway epithelial cells from mice and humans with CF. β1-integrin accumulation is due to increased ceramide and the formation of ceramide platforms that trap β1-integrins on the luminal pole of bronchial epithelial cells. β1-integrins downregulate acid ceramidase expression, resulting in further accumulation of ceramide and consequent reduction of surface sphingosine, a lipid that kills bacteria. Interrupting this vicious cycle by triggering surface β1-integrin internalization via anti-β1-integrin antibodies or the RGD peptide ligand-or by genetic or pharmacological correction of ceramide levels-normalizes β1-integrin distribution and sphingosine levels in CF epithelial cells and prevents P. aeruginosa infection in CF mice. These findings suggest a therapeutic avenue to ameliorate CF-associated bacterial infections.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

28584915	Understanding Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: insights from focal epilepsy patients with Lennox-Gastaut features	"To delineate the clinical and EEG features of adults with focal epilepsy associated with a generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) pattern on EEG who developed refractory seizures, notably drop attacks, but do not fulfill the classical triad for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and provide further insight into LGS mechanisms. Among 957 patients admitted to video-EEG monitoring between 2002 and 2015, we retrospectively research adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy, drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. We collected demographic, anamnestic, and clinical data from medical records. We reviewed for all patients the interictal and ictal video-EEG recordings. We identified ten patients with focal epilepsy and electro-clinical features of LGS. As compared to classical LGS patients, our patients: (1) began epilepsy later (15.4 ± 8 years); (2) exhibited exclusively focal onset seizures, including drop attacks seizures linked to focal asymmetrical tonic posturing seizures; (3) had a stable cognition over time and (4) evolved favourably with a good secondary response to treatments in 80% of cases. Interestingly, all patients exhibited apparent diffuse interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities but a detailed analysis revealed that 50% had asymmetrical GPFA and 70% secondary bilateral synchrony processes. We may hypothesize here that a process of ""secondary LGS"" occurred which produced a worsening of seizures with the apparition of drop attacks and GPFA on EEG. This study brings arguments to consider that some cases of LGS could be linked to the development of a ""secondary epileptic network"" driven by a primary focal epileptic zone."

Recently, de novo variants in BCL11A have been reported in individuals with intellectual disability syndrome without epilepsy. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 302 patients with epileptic encephalopathies (EEs), and identified 2 novel BCL11A variants, c.577delC (p.His193Metfs\*3) and c.2351A>C (p.Lys784Thr). Both the patients shared major physical features characteristic of BCL11A-related intellectual disability syndrome, suggesting that characteristic physical features and the persistence of HbF should lead clinicians to suspect EEs caused by BCL11A pathogenic variants. Patient 1, with a frameshift variant, presented with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which expands the phenotypic spectrum of BCL11A haploinsufficiency. Patient 2, with a p.Lys784Thr variant, presented with West syndrome followed by drug-resistant focal seizures and more severe developmental disability. These 2 newly described patients contribute to delineating the associated, yet uncertain phenotypic characteristics of BCL11A disease-causing variants.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

28608633	Asymptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Children with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) may have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, clubbing, cyanosis and hemoptysis. However, some patients with pulmonary AVMs may be asymptomatic, placing them at risk for complications such as stroke or brain abscess if they are not identified and treated. **This study examines the incidence of signs and symptoms associated with pulmonary AVMs in children with HHT known to have pulmonary AVMs.** Sixty-one children with HHT and documented pulmonary AVMs were questioned for any symptoms possibly associated with their pulmonary AVMs, prior to embolization. The results show that the majority of these children were asymptomatic (56%), and their AVMs were discovered by routine screening. Those who did experience symptoms most often complained of shortness of breath and exercise intolerance, although there was a tendency to blame other conditions, such as asthma or deconditioning (being out of shape), for these symptoms. Migraine headaches were common in those with pulmonary AVMs, regardless of whether they were symptomatic or not (17 of 61 children, 28%), although they were more common in those who were symptomatic (10 of 27, 37%) versus those who were asymptomatic (7 of 34, 21%). Children with HHT and pulmonary AVMs are often asymptomatic. Routine screening for the presence of AVMs should be performed regardless of symptomatology.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

28633068	Multi-electrode system for measurement of transmembrane ion-fluxes through living epithelial cells	Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal human genetic disease. It is caused by the defect in a single anion channel protein which affects ion and water transport across the epithelial tissue. A flat multi-electrode platform of diameter 12mm, allowing for measurement of four ions: sodium, potassium, hydrogen and chloride by exchangeable/replaceable ion-selective electrodes is described. The measurement is possible owing to the architecture of the platform which accommodates all the electrodes and inlets/outlets. The platform fits to the cup and operates in a small volume of the solution bathing the living epithelial cell layer (membrane) deposited on a porous support of the cup, which allows for effective monitoring of ion concentration changes. By applying two multi-electrode platforms, it is possible to measure the ion transmembrane fluxes. The inlet and outlet tubes in the platforms allow for on-fly change of the calibrants, ion-concentration changes and ion channel blockers. Using different ion-concentration gradients and blockers of ion-transporting molecules we show for the first time that sodium ions flow from the basolateral to apical face of the cell monolayer via a paracellular route and return also via a transcellular one, while chloride anions are transported back and forth exclusively via a transcellular route.	cystic fibrosis			235	Multi-electrode system for measurement of transmembrane ion-fluxes through living epithelial cells.

Analysis of a cohort of consecutive NF1 patients seen in our NF1 clinic during a three-year period. Of the 184 NF1 patients seen during that period, 26 had epilepsy and three had febrile seizures. Of the 26, 17 (65%) had localization-related epilepsy, seven of whom (41%) were drug resistant. Six (23%) had apparently primary generalized epilepsy (0/6 drug resistant), two (8%) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and one (4%) West syndrome (all three were drug-resistant). As compared to the patients with no epilepsy, those with epilepsy were more likely to have MRI findings of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (23% vs. 5%, p=0.0064), and cerebral hemisphere tumors (31% vs. 10%, p=0.0079), but not of the other MRI findings including neurofibromatosis bright objects, or optic gliomas. Three of the six patients with MTS underwent temporal lobectomy with subsequent control of their seizures with confirmation of MTS on pathology in 3/3 and presence of coexisting focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in 2/3. We also have observed three additional patients outside the above study with the association of NF1, MTS, and intractable epilepsy. Epilepsy is relatively common in NF1, often occurs in patients with brain tumors or with MTS which can coexist with FCD, can be associated with multiple types of epilepsy syndromes, and when localization-related is often drug-resistant. Patients with NF1 and MTS can respond to medial temporal lobectomy and may have coexisting medial temporal lobe cortical dysplasia.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

28643178	Economic Evaluation of Tobramycin Inhalation Powder for the Treatment of Chronic Pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis	Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs in approximately 50% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This infection further compromises lung function, and significantly contributes to the increased healthcare costs. Inhaled tobramycin, used to manage P. aeruginosa infection in CF patients, is available as powder (tobramycin inhalation powder, TIP) and solution (tobramycin inhalation solution, TIS). Evidence suggests increased adherence with the use of TIP over TIS. Hence, this analysis aimed to evaluate the potential pharmacoeconomic benefit of increased adherence with TIP over TIS in the US setting. A patient-level simulation model was developed to compare TIP with TIS. Both costs and benefits were predicted over a 10-year time horizon from a payer's perspective, and were discounted annually at 3%. All costs were presented in 2016 US dollars. TIP was associated with greater quality-adjusted life-years (by 0.27) and lower total costs (by US$36,168) as compared with TIS over a 10-year time horizon. TIP-treated patients experienced a decreased mean number of exacerbations than TIS-treated patients (39.24 vs 50.20). Furthermore, administration of TIP via the T-326 Inhaler was associated with significant cost savings per patient, because of the nebulizer required for administering TIS (by US$1596) and exacerbation costs (by US$76,531). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TIP was dominant over TIS in 100% of the simulations. TIP is likely to be a more cost-effective treatment than TIS, and therefore may reduce the economic burden of CF.	cystic fibrosis			299	Economic Evaluation of Tobramycin Inhalation Powder for the Treatment of Chronic Pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.

In this prospective observational study, blood from CF patients experiencing FPE was tested with SF and BC before the initiation of antibiotic treatment. After contaminants had been excluded, 9 of 72 blood samples tested positive by BC or SF. SF exclusively detected four pathogens; BC, one. Pulmonary pathogen transmission was likely in all cases except for 2 cases of candidaemia, which were believed to be caused by catheter-related infections. For three cases, test results caused us to change the antibiotic regimen. Sensitivity (85.7% vs. 42.9%) and negative predictive value (98.4% vs. 87.0%) tended to be higher for SF than for BC. The results of SF and BC show that bacteraemia and fungaemia are present in CF patients during FPE and may affect antibiotic therapy. SF can help rule out catheter-related bloodstream infections.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

28667181	DNM1 encephalopathy: A new disease of vesicle fission	To evaluate the phenotypic spectrum caused by mutations in dynamin 1 (DNM1), encoding the presynaptic protein DNM1, and to investigate possible genotype-phenotype correlations and predicted functional consequences based on structural modeling. We reviewed phenotypic data of 21 patients (7 previously published) with DNM1 mutations. We compared mutation data to known functional data and undertook biomolecular modeling to assess the effect of the mutations on protein function. We identified 19 patients with de novo mutations in DNM1 and a sibling pair who had an inherited mutation from a mosaic parent. Seven patients (33.3%) carried the recurrent p.Arg237Trp mutation. A common phenotype emerged that included severe to profound intellectual disability and muscular hypotonia in all patients and an epilepsy characterized by infantile spasms in 16 of 21 patients, frequently evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Two patients had profound global developmental delay without seizures. In addition, we describe a single patient with normal development before the onset of a catastrophic epilepsy, consistent with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome at 4 years. All mutations cluster within the GTPase or middle domains, and structural modeling and existing functional data suggest a dominant-negative effect on DMN1 function. The phenotypic spectrum of DNM1-related encephalopathy is relatively homogeneous, in contrast to many other genetic epilepsies. Up to one-third of patients carry the recurrent p.Arg237Trp variant, which is now one of the most common recurrent variants in epileptic encephalopathies identified to date. Given the predicted dominant-negative mechanism of this mutation, this variant presents a prime target for therapeutic intervention.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		288	DNM1 encephalopathy: A new disease of vesicle fission. To evaluate the phenotypic spectrum caused by mutations in dynamin 1 (DNM1), encoding the presynaptic protein DNM1, and to investigate possible genotype-phenotype correlations and predicted functional consequences based on structural modeling. We reviewed phenotypic data of 21 patients (7 previously published) with DNM1 mutations. We compared mutation data to known functional data and undertook biomolecular modeling to assess the effect of the mutations on protein function. We identified 19 patients with de novo mutations in DNM1 and a sibling pair who had an inherited mutation from a mosaic parent. Seven patients (33.3%) carried the recurrent p.Arg237Trp mutation. A common phenotype emerged that included severe to profound intellectual disability and muscular hypotonia in all patients and an epilepsy characterized by infantile spasms in 16 of 21 patients, frequently evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Two patients had profound global developmental delay without seizures. In addition, we describe a single patient with normal development before the onset of a catastrophic epilepsy, consistent with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome at 4 years. All mutations cluster within the GTPase or middle domains, and structural modeling and existing functional data suggest a dominant-negative effect on DMN1 function. The phenotypic spectrum of DNM1-related encephalopathy is relatively homogeneous, in contrast to many other genetic epilepsies.

28671294	Osteonecrosis after intranasal injection with bevacizumab in treating hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A case report	Intranasal bevacizumab injections have been used in treating hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)-related epistaxis since 2009. It is believed to be a safe and effective treatment for a selected group of HHT patients in reducing frequency and intensity of epistaxis, with few or none adverse effects. In this case report, however, we will describe a patient who developed bilateral osteonecrosis in the knees while undergoing regular intranasal submucosal bevacizumab injections. Although osteonecrosis previously has been documented in patients receiving bevacizumab intravenously in oncologic doses, thus far it has not been reported in patients treated with intranasal submucosal injections.

28687708	Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations in EPHB4 Cause a Second Form of Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM2) Deregulating RAS-MAPK Signaling	Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM. Previously, we identified RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM-AVM. Herein we studied non-RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. We conducted a genome-wide linkage study on a CM-AVM family. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM-AVM families. We identified a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The influence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. We found evidence for linkage in 2 loci. Whole-exome sequencing data unraveled 4 distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 in 5 families that cosegregated with CM-AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 led to a premature stop codon or splice-site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are nonsynonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations confirmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multifocal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The phenotype, CM-AVM2, mimics RASA1-related CM-AVM1 and also hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. RASA1-encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlight the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4-RAS-ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for AVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

28782435	Rufinamide pretreatment attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury in the gerbil hippocampus	Rufinamide, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker, is widely used for the clinical treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that VGSC blockers have neuroprotective properties against ischemic damage following experimental cerebral ischemia. However, protective effects of rufinamide against cerebral ischemic insults have not been addressed. Therefore, in the present study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of rufinamide using a gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia. Gerbils were established by the occlusion of common carotid arteries for 5 min. The gerbils were divided into vehicle-treated sham-operated group, vehicle-treated ischemia-operated group, 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated sham-operated groups, and 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated ischemia-operated groups. Rufinamide was administrated intraperitoneally once daily for 3 days before ischemic surgery. To examine neuroprotective effects of rufinamide, we carried out cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence staining. In addition, we examined gliosis using immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (a marker for microglia). We found that pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide effectively protected pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) area after transient global cerebral ischemia. In addition, pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide significantly attenuated activations of astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 area. These findings suggest that rufinamide can display neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic insults and that its neuroprotective effect may involve the attenuation of ischemia-induced glial activation.

28819878	Aspergillus Bronchitis in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis	Aspergillus fumigatus frequently colonizes the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and may cause various severe infections, such as bronchitis. Serological data, sputum dependent markers and longitudinal data of treated cases of Aspergillus bronchitis were evaluated for further description of this infection. This study, which comprises three substudies, aimed to analyze epidemiological data of Aspergillus in CF and the entity of Aspergillus bronchitis. In a first step, data of the German Cystic Fibrosis Registry were used to evaluate the frequency of Aspergillus colonization in patients with CF (n = 2599). Then a retrospective analysis of 10 cases of Aspergillus bronchitis was performed to evaluate longitudinal data for lung function and clinical presentation parameters: sputum production, cough and physical capacity. Finally, a prospective cohort study (n = 22) was conducted to investigate serological markers for Aspergillus bronchitis: total serum IgE, specific serum IgE, specific serum IgG, as well as sputum galactomannan, real-time PCR detection of Aspergillus DNA in sputum and fungal cultures. Analysis of the German CF registry revealed an Aspergillus colonization rate of 32.5% among the 2599 patients. A retrospective data analysis of 10 treated cases revealed the clinical course of Aspergillus bronchitis, including repeated positive sputum culture findings for A. fumigatus, no antibiotic treatment response, total serum IgE levels <200 kU/l, no observation of new pulmonary infiltrates and appropriate antifungal treatment response. Antifungal treatment durations of 4 ± 1.6 (2-6) weeks significantly reduced cough (P = 0.0067), sputum production (P < 0.0001) and lung function measures (P = 0.0358) but not physical capacity (P = 0.0794). From this retrospective study, a prevalence of 1.6% was calculated. In addition, two cases of Aspergillus bronchitis were identified in the prospective cohort study according to immunological, molecular and microbiological parameters. A prevalence of 9% was assessed. Aspergillus bronchitis appears to occur in a minority of colonized CF patients. Antifungal treatment may reduce respiratory symptoms and restore lung function.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

Our** aim was to evaluate LCI variability in clinically stable CF lung disease in school age children.** Paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17years, attending the outpatient CF clinic performed Multiple Breath Nitrogen Washout (Exhalyzer® D) and spirometry every third month over a period of one year. Clinical stability was assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Score (CFCS) at each visit. Twentyfive children were recruited: baseline median (range) FEV1% pred. 91 (55-122)%, LCI 9.1 (6.4-18.6), CFCS 15 (12-23). A total of 107 visits were included in the study, of which 93% were defined as clinically stable. In clinically stable visits, within-subject variability of LCI and FEV1% pred. were 10% and 16%, respectively. The upper limit of normal (ULN, 95% percentile) of LCI variability during clinical stability was 17%. LCI within-subject variability was low and comparable to FEV1% pred. which strengthen the use of LCI to monitor lung disease progression in CF patients. An increase in LCI >17% compared to previous LCI-measurement in clinically stable CF patients may therefore indicate early lung disease progression.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

28846756	Prevalence of Pathogenic Copy Number Variation in Adults With Pediatric-Onset Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability	Copy number variation (CNV) is an important cause of neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about the role of CNV in adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability. To evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs and identify possible candidate CNVs and genes in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability. In this cross-sectional study, genome-wide microarray was used to evaluate a cohort of 143 adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability who were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital epilepsy outpatient clinic from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. The inclusion criteria were (1) pediatric seizure onset with ongoing seizure activity in adulthood, (2) intellectual disability of any degree, and (3) no structural brain abnormalities or metabolic conditions that could explain the seizures. DNA screening was performed using genome-wide microarray platforms. Pathogenicity of CNVs was assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score was used to evaluate genes within the identified CNVs that could play a role in each patient's phenotype. Of the 2335 patients, 143 probands were investigated (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [10.8] years; 69 male and 74 female). Twenty-three probands (16.1%) and 4 affected relatives (2.8%) (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [6.1] years; 11 male and 16 female) presented with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs (0.08-18.9 Mb). Five of the 23 probands with positive results (21.7%) had more than 1 CNV reported. Parental testing revealed de novo CNVs in 11 (47.8%), with CNVs inherited from a parent in 4 probands (17.4%). Sixteen of 23 probands (69.6%) presented with previously cataloged human genetic disorders and/or defined CNV hot spots in epilepsy. Eight nonrecurrent rare CNVs that overlapped 1 or more genes associated with intellectual disability, autism, and/or epilepsy were identified: 2p16.1-p15 duplication, 6p25.3-p25.1 duplication, 8p23.3p23.1 deletion, 9p24.3-p23 deletion, 10q11.22-q11.23 duplication, 12p13.33-13.2 duplication, 13q34 deletion, and 16p13.2 duplication. Five genes are of particular interest given their potential pathogenicity in the corresponding phenotypes and least tolerability to variation: ABAT, KIAA2022, COL4A1, CACNA1C, and SMARCA2. ABAT duplication was associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and KIAA2022 deletion with Jeavons syndrome. The high prevalence of pathogenic CNVs in this study highlights the importance of microarray analysis in adults with unexplained childhood-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability. Additional studies and comparison with similar cases are required to evaluate the effects of deletions and duplications that overlap specific genes.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		491	... 2012, through December 31, 2014. The inclusion criteria were (1) pediatric seizure onset with ongoing seizure activity in adulthood, (2) intellectual disability of any degree, and (3) no structural brain abnormalities or metabolic conditions that could explain the seizures. DNA screening was performed using genome-wide microarray platforms. Pathogenicity of CNVs was assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score was used to evaluate genes within the identified CNVs that could play a role in each patient's phenotype. Of the 2335 patients, 143 probands were investigated (mean [SD] age, 24.6 [10.8] years; 69 male and 74 female). Twenty-three probands (16.1%) and 4 affected relatives (2.8%) (mean [SD] age, 24.1 [6.1] years; 11 male and 16 female) presented with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs (0.08-18.9 Mb). Five of the 23 probands with positive results (21.7%) had more than 1 CNV reported. Parental testing revealed de novo CNVs in 11 (47.8%), with CNVs inherited from a parent in 4 probands (17.4%).

28856720	A double echo ultra short echo time (UTE) acquisition for respiratory motion-suppressed high resolution imaging of the lung	Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising alternative to computed tomography for lung imaging. However, organ motion and poor signal-to-noise ratio, arising from short T2\*, impair image quality. To alleviate these issues, a new retrospective gating method was implemented and tested with an ultra-short echo time sequence. A 3D double-echo ultra-short echo time sequence was used to acquire data during free breathing in ten healthy adult subjects. A self-gating method was used to reconstruct respiratory motion suppressed expiratory and inspiratory images. These images were objectively compared to uncorrected data sets using quantitative end-points (pulmonary vessel sharpness, lung-liver interface definition, signal-to-noise ratio). The method was preliminarily tested in two cystic fibrosis patients who underwent computed tomography. Vessel sharpness in expiratory ultra-short echo time data sets with second echo motion detection was significantly higher (13% relative increase) than in uncorrected images while the opposite was observed in inspiratory images. The method was successfully applied in patients and some findings (e.g., hypointense areas) were similar to those from computed tomography. Free breathing ultra-short echo time was successfully implemented, allowing flexible image reconstruction of two different respiratory states. Objective improvements in image quality were obtained with the new method and initial feasibility in a clinical setting was demonstrated.

28874317	Generalized paroxysmal fast activity in EEG: An unrecognized finding in genetic generalized epilepsy	"To study generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). GPFA is an electroencephalographic (EEG) finding in patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy consisting of 15-25Hz bifrontally predominant generalized fast activity seen predominantly in sleep. Historically GPFA is linked to epileptic encephalopathy with drug resistant epilepsy and intellectual disability. However, GPFA has been rarely described as an atypical finding in patients with GGE without negative prognostic implication. We report cognitive profile and seizure characteristics in seven patients with GGE and GPFA. The Vanderbilt EMU and EEG reports were searched for the keywords ""idiopathic generalized epilepsy"", ""GPFA""and ""generalized spike and wave discharges (GSWD)"". We reviewed the EEG tracings and the electronic medical records of patients thus identified. The seizure type, frequency, neurological work-up, clinical profile and imaging data were recorded. Awake and sleep states were captured on EEGs of all patients. On EEG tracing review six patients were confirmed to have GSWD and GPFA; one patient had GPFA but no GSWD. All patients had normal cognitive function. Four had a normal brain MRI and one a normal head CT (two were never imaged). None of the patients had tonic seizures. The main seizure type was generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in five patients, absence in two. Age at onset of epilepsy ranged from 4 to 24years. The mean GTC seizure frequency at the time of EEG was 3; two patients were seizure free on two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). GPFA can be an unrecognized electrographic finding in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy. While GPFA remains an important diagnostic EEG feature for epileptic encephalopathy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) it is not specific for this diagnosis. Thus, GPFA may have a spectrum of variable phenotypic expression. The finding of GPFA is not necessarily indicative of unfavorable outcome."	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

28973643	Tacrolimus rescues the signaling and gene expression signature of endothelial ALK1 loss-of-function and improves HHT vascular pathology	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a highly debilitating and life-threatening genetic vascular disorder arising from endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and hypervascularization, for which no cure exists. Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs. Tacrolimus repurposing has therefore therapeutic potential in HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

28974743	Targeting the alternative sigma factor RpoN to combat virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that infects immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients. Treatment is difficult due to antibiotic resistance, and new antimicrobials are needed to treat infections. The alternative sigma factor 54 (σ54, RpoN), regulates many virulence-associated genes. Thus, we evaluated inhibition of virulence in P. aeruginosa by a designed peptide (RpoN molecular roadblock, RpoN_) which binds specifically to RpoN consensus promoters. We expected that RpoN_ binding to its consensus promoter sites would repress gene expression and thus virulence by blocking RpoN and/or other transcription factors. RpoN_ reduced transcription of approximately 700 genes as determined by microarray analysis, including genes related to virulence. RpoN_ expression significantly reduced motility, protease secretion, pyocyanin and pyoverdine production, rhamnolipid production, and biofilm formation. Given the effectiveness of RpoN_ in vitro, we explored its effects in a Caenorhabditis elegans-P. aeruginosa infection model. Expression of RpoN_ protected C. elegans in a paralytic killing assay, whereas worms succumbed to paralysis and death in its absence. In a slow killing assay, which mimics establishment and proliferation of an infection, C. elegans survival was prolonged when RpoN\* was expressed. Thus, blocking RpoN consensus promoter sites is an effective strategy for abrogation of P. aeruginosa virulence.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

GATT polymorphism analysis was performed using direct polymerase chain reaction amplification, and the MP6-D9, TUB09 and TUB18 polymorphism analyses were performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism. Nine haplotypes were found in 37 CFTR alleles, and of those, 24 were linked with the F508del mutation and 13 with other CFTR mutations. The 6 (GATT), C (MP6-D9), G (TUB09), and C (TUB18) haplotypes showed the highest prevalence (48%) of the mutant CFTR allele and were linked to the F508del mutation (64%).

29080903	Human endoglin as a potential new partner involved in platelet-endothelium interactions	Complex interactions between platelets and activated endothelium occur during the thrombo-inflammatory reaction at sites of vascular injuries and during vascular hemostasis. The endothelial receptor endoglin is involved in inflammation through integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion and transmigration; and heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. This vascular disease is characterized by a bleeding tendency that is postulated to be a consequence of telangiectasia fragility rather than a platelet defect, since platelets display normal functions in vitro in this condition. Here, w**e hypothesize that endoglin may act as an adhesion molecule involved in the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets through integrin recognition. **We find that the extracellular domain of human endoglin promotes specific platelet adhesion under static conditions and confers resistance of adherent platelets to detachment upon exposure to flow. Also, platelets adhere to confluent endothelial cells in an endoglin-mediated process. Remarkably, Chinese hamster ovary cells ectopically expressing the human αIIbβ3 integrin acquire the capacity to adhere to myoblast transfectants expressing human endoglin, whereas platelets from Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients lacking the αIIbβ3 integrin are defective for endoglin-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Furthermore, the bleeding time, but not the prothrombin time, is significantly prolonged in endoglin-haplodeficient (Eng +/-) mice compared to Eng +/+ animals. These results suggest a new role for endoglin in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and may provide a better understanding on the basic cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory events.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

29098688	Thalamocortical functional connectivity in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is abnormally enhanced in executive-control and default-mode networks	To identify abnormal thalamocortical circuits in the severe epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that may explain the shared electroclinical phenotype and provide potential treatment targets. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of LGS (mean age = 28.5 years) and 26 healthy controls (mean age = 27.6 years) were compared using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The thalamus was parcellated according to functional connectivity with 10 cortical networks derived using group-level independent component analysis. For each cortical network, we assessed between-group differences in thalamic functional connectivity strength using nonparametric permutation-based tests. Anatomical locations were identified by quantifying spatial overlap with a histologically informed thalamic MRI atlas. In both groups, posterior thalamic regions showed functional connectivity with visual, auditory, and sensorimotor networks, whereas anterior, medial, and dorsal thalamic regions were connected with networks of distributed association cortex (including the default-mode, anterior-salience, and executive-control networks). Four cortical networks (left and right executive-control network; ventral and dorsal default-mode network) showed significantly enhanced thalamic functional connectivity strength in patients relative to controls. Abnormal connectivity was maximal in mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. Specific thalamocortical circuits are affected in LGS. Functional connectivity is abnormally enhanced between the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus and the default-mode and executive-control networks, thalamocortical circuits that normally support diverse cognitive processes. In contrast, thalamic regions connecting with primary and sensory cortical networks appear to be less affected. Our previous neuroimaging studies show that epileptic activity in LGS is expressed via the default-mode and executive-control networks. Results of the present study suggest that the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus may be candidate targets for modulating abnormal network behavior underlying LGS, potentially via emerging thalamic neurostimulation therapies.

In both groups, posterior thalamic regions showed functional connectivity with visual, auditory, and sensorimotor networks, whereas anterior, medial, and dorsal thalamic regions were connected with networks of distributed association cortex (including the default-mode, anterior-salience, and executive-control networks). Four cortical networks (left and right executive-control network; ventral and dorsal default-mode network) showed significantly enhanced thalamic functional connectivity strength in patients relative to controls. Abnormal connectivity was maximal in mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. Specific thalamocortical circuits are affected in LGS. Functional connectivity is abnormally enhanced between the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus and the default-mode and executive-control networks, thalamocortical circuits that normally support diverse cognitive processes. In contrast, thalamic regions connecting with primary and sensory cortical networks appear to be less affected. Our previous neuroimaging studies show that epileptic activity in LGS is expressed via the default-mode and executive-control networks. Results of the present study suggest that the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus may be candidate targets for modulating abnormal network behavior underlying LGS, potentially via emerging thalamic neurostimulation therapies.
29099689	Identification of novel small RNAs in Burkholderia cenocepacia  KC-01 expressed under iron limitation and oxidative stress conditions	Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression is a major tool to understand bacterial responses to environmental changes. In particular, pathogenic bacteria employ sRNAs to adapt to the host environment and establish infection. Members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, normally present in soil microbiota, cause nosocomial lung infection especially in hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients. We sequenced the draft genome of Burkholderia cenocepacia KC-01, isolated from the coastal saline soil, and identified several potential sRNAs in silico. Expression of seven small RNAs (Bc_KC_sr1-7) was subsequently confirmed. Two sRNAs (Bc_KC_sr1 and Bc_KC_sr2) were upregulated in response to iron depletion by 2,2'-bipyridyl and another two (Bc_KC_sr3 and Bc_KC_sr4) responded to the presence of 60 µM H2O2 in the culture media. Bc_Kc_sr5, 6 and 7 remained unchanged under these conditions. Expression of Bc_KC_sr2, 3 and 4 also altered with a change in temperature and incubation time. A search in the Rfam and BSRD databases identified Bc_Kc_sr4 as candidate738 in B. pseudomallei D286 and assigned Bc_Kc_sr5 and 6 as tmRNA and 6S RNA, respectively. The novel sRNAs were conserved in Burkholderiaceae but did not have any homologue in other genera. Bc_KC_sr1 and 4 were transcribed independently while the rest were part of the 3' UTR of their upstream genes. TargetRNA2 predicted that these sRNAs could target a host of cellular messages with very high stringency. Intriguingly, regions surrounding the translation initiation site for several enzymes involved in Fe-S cluster and siderophore biosynthesis, ROS homeostasis, porins, transcription and translation regulators, were among the suggested putative binding sites for these sRNAs.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

29112089	Assessment of Liver Disease Progression in Cystic Fibrosis Using Transient Elastography	Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) can develop silently in early life and approximately 10% of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) become cirrhotic before adulthood. Clinical, biological, and ultrasound criteria used to define CFLD often reveal liver involvement at an advanced stage. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the progression of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in pediatric patients with CF. The change of LSM, expressed as kPa/year and %/year, was measured using transient elastography (Fibroscan) in 82 children with CF (median age: 6.8 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 5.8). Mean time interval between the 2 LSM was 3.5 years. Median initial liver stiffness was 3.7 kPa (IQR: 1.3), and then progressed by 0.23 kPa/year, that is, 6%/year. The 7 patients who developed CFLD had a higher initial level of alanine aminotransferase (50 [IQR: 15] vs 30 [IQR: 18], P = 0.0001) and presented a more rapid progression of LSM (0.94 vs 0.23 kPa/year, P = 0.02). The present study shows that the slope of worsening of liver stiffness is greater in patients who will develop CFLD, suggesting that annual transient elastography may be useful to detect risk of severe liver disease at an earlier stage.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

29121573	Rufinamide: Crystal structure elucidation and solid state characterization	Rufinamide (R) is a triazole derivative approved for the management of partial seizures and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, in November 2007. Crystal structure, solid state characterization, drug-excipient compatibility and solubility play a pivotal role in formulation development. This work deals with the crystal structure elucidation of R by single crystal X-ray diffraction and solid state characterization by thermal, spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. Drug- excipient compatibility was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). New RP-HPLC method for quantification of R was developed with improved retention time. Solubility and dissolution of drug in different media was determined. Additionally, the flow behavior of the drug was evaluated by measuring Carr's index and Hausner's ratio, while the compressibility behavior was studied using Well's protocol. R crystallized from dimethylformamide (R-DMF) was utilized for single crystal analysis. The drug crystallized in triclinic crystal system with P-1 space group. Asymmetric unit cell consists of two molecules of R held by intermolecular hydrogen bond (connected by NH⋯O, which forms the catemeric chain). Analytical outcomes from DSC, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed that the drug was present in pure crystalline form and was devoid of any polymorphic or pseudopolymorphic impurities. Influence of pH on the solubility and dissolution of R-DMF was found to be insignificant. The drug exhibited poor aqueous solubility, which was improved nearly 4.6 fold with the addition of 2% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). The drug exhibits poor flow and elastic compression nature. Excipients such as poly ethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, SLS, lactose monohydrate, starch and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E15 were incompatible with R-DMF as identified by thermal analysis. It is envisaged that these information regarding solid state properties of R-DMF would aid in identifying a logical path for formulation development.

29122084	Vitamin D₃ deficiency and its association with nasal polyposis in patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis	Currently vitamin D3 (VD3) or cholecalciferol is considered an immunomodulator that may be implicated in nasal polyposis (NP) pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate if deficiency of VD3 is associated with the presence of NP in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). In total, 152 adult participants were included in five phenotypic groups: CF with NP (CFwNP) (n = 27), CF without NP (CFsNP) (n = 31), CRS with NP (CRSwNP) (n = 32), CRS without NP (CRSsNP) (n = 30), and controls (n = 32). The serum levels of 25(OH)-VD3 < 20 ng/mL are considered as a deficiency, 21-29 ng/mL as insufficiency, and >30 ng/mL as sufficiency. Endoscopic and imaging staging of the mucosal disease performed with the Lund-Kennedy (LK) and Lund-Mackay (LM) scoring systems, respectively. The genotype of the patients with CF and the nasal microbial colonization of the patients with CF and patients with CRS were also recorded. The patients with CFwNP had the lowest percentage of sufficiency in VD3 and the highest percentage in insufficiency among all the groups. The LM imaging scores were inversely correlated with the VD3 levels in both arms of the study (CF and CRS). Moreover, the LK endoscopic scores had a similar correlation in the CF groups; however, this was not the case with the CRS groups. The genotype of the patients with CF was not correlated with the VD3 serum levels. The patients with positive microbial colonization (mainly Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus) had significantly lower VD3 serum levels in both the CF and CRS process. VD3 deficiency seemed to be associated with the presence of nasal polyps in the patients with CRS and in the patients with CF in a similar manner. The lower the level of serum VD3, the more severe the mucosal disease was found in the imaging studies and the more frequent microbial colonization of the patients with CF and the patients with CRS.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

In the long term, patients with this condition still have intractable seizures, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical comorbidities. **The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and EEG characteristics of a group of adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. **We identified 38 (22 females, 16 males) patients with LGS older than age 18years at their last evaluation, with mean age of 43.3±10.6years. Median follow-up was 14.4years (range: 2-40). All of our patients had 3 or more seizure types during their clinical history. The most prevalent seizure types at follow-up were atypical absences (28/38), tonic (28/38), generalized tonic-clonic (17/38), focal (11/38), and myoclonic seizures (9/38). All patients had drug-resistant seizures. Besides epilepsy, intellectual disability and behavioral problems were prominent features. Surprisingly, paroxysmal nonepileptic seizures were reported in 3 patients. Our observations confirm the poor outcome of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through adulthood, regardless of age at seizure onset, etiology, and history of previous West syndrome.

29154969	Adults with cystic fibrosis have deficits in bone structure and strength at the distal tibia despite similar size and measuring standard and relative sites	Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have lower bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA and are at higher risk of fracture than healthy controls. However, the 2-dimensional measurement of areal BMD (aBMD) provided by DXA is influenced by bone size and the true extent of the bone deficit is unclear. Our objective was to use high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) analysis to compare volumetric BMD (vBMD), microarchitecture and estimated strength at the distal radius and tibia in 26 young adults with CF and 26 controls matched for age, gender, and race. To assess the effect of limb length and minimize the confounding effects of size on HR-pQCT outcomes, we scanned participants at both the standard fixed HR-pQCT measurement sites and at a subject-specific relative site that varied according to limb length. CF participants did not differ significantly in age, height, weight, or BMI from controls. Ulnar and tibial lengths were 9mm shorter in CF patients, though differences were not significant. CF patients had significantly lower BMI-adjusted aBMD by DXA at the lumbar spine (8.9%, p<0.01), total hip (11.5%, p<0.01) and femoral neck (14.5%, p<0.01), but not at the forearm. At the fixed radius site, thickness of trabecular plates and torsional stiffness were significantly lower in CF participants than controls. At the relative radius site, only torsional stiffness was significantly lower in CF participants. At the tibia, total, trabecular and cortical vBMD were significantly lower at both fixed and relative sites in CF participants, with fewer, more widely-spaced trabecular plates, lower trabecular connectivity, and lower axial and torsional stiffness. Our results confirm that aBMD is lower at the spine and hip in young adults with CF, independent of BMI and body size. We also conclude that vBMD and stiffness are lower at the weight-bearing tibia. The pathogenesis of these differences in bone density and strength at the tibia appear to be related to trabecular drop-out and reduced trabecular connectivity and to be independent of differences in limb length, as assessed by scanning participants at both standard and relative sites. We concluded that significant deficits in bone structure and strength persist in young adults with CF, despite advances in care that permit them to attain relatively normal height and weight.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

29158263	High-throughput screening identifies FAU protein as a regulator of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel	In cystic fibrosis, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel causes misfolding and premature degradation. One possible approach to reducing the detrimental health effects of cystic fibrosis could be the identification of proteins whose suppression rescues F508del-CFTR function in bronchial epithelial cells. However, searches for these potential targets have not yet been conducted, particularly in a relevant airway background using a functional readout. To identify proteins associated with F508del-CFTR processing, we used a high-throughput functional assay to screen an siRNA library targeting 6,650 different cellular proteins. We identified 37 proteins whose silencing significantly rescued F508del-CFTR activity, as indicated by enhanced anion transport through the plasma membrane. These proteins included FAU, UBE2I, UBA52, MLLT6, UBA2, CHD4, PLXNA1, and TRIM24, among others. We focused our attention on FAU, a poorly characterized protein with unknown function. FAU knockdown increased the plasma membrane targeting and function of F508del-CFTR, but not of wild-type CFTR. Investigation into the mechanism of action revealed a preferential physical interaction of FAU with mutant CFTR, leading to its degradation. FAU and other proteins identified in our screening may offer a therapeutically relevant panel of drug targets to correct basic defects in F508del-CFTR processing.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

29217756	Light-focusing human micro-lenses generated from pluripotent stem cells model lens development and drug-induced cataract in vitro	Cataracts cause vision loss and blindness by impairing the ability of the ocular lens to focus light onto the retina. Various cataract risk factors have been identified, including drug treatments, age, smoking and diabetes. However, the molecular events responsible for these different forms of cataract are ill-defined, and the advent of modern cataract surgery in the 1960s virtually eliminated access to human lenses for research. Here, we demonstrate large-scale production of light-focusing human micro-lenses from spheroidal masses of human lens epithelial cells purified from differentiating pluripotent stem cells. The purified lens cells and micro-lenses display similar morphology, cellular arrangement, mRNA expression and protein expression to human lens cells and lenses. Exposing the micro-lenses to the emergent cystic fibrosis drug Vx-770 reduces micro-lens transparency and focusing ability. These human micro-lenses provide a powerful and large-scale platform for defining molecular disease mechanisms caused by cataract risk factors, for anti-cataract drug screening and for clinically relevant toxicity assays.	cystic fibrosis			188	Light-focusing human micro-lenses generated from pluripotent stem cells model lens development and drug-induced cataract in vitro.

29240302	Correlation between sinus and lung cultures in lung transplant patients with cystic fibrosis	Lung transplantation has revolutionized the treatment of end-stage pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis. However, infection of the transplanted lungs can lead to serious complications, including graft failure and death. Although many of these patients have concurrent sinusitis, it is unclear whether bacteria from the sinuses can infect the allograft. This is a single-institution retrospective study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis from 2005 to 2015 at Duke University Hospital. Pre- and posttransplant nasal and pulmonary cultures obtained via nasal endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), respectively, were analyzed. A total of 141 patients underwent 144 lung transplants. Sinus cultures were available for 76 patients (12 pretransplant, 42 posttransplant, 22 both pre- and posttransplant). Pretransplant BAL cultures were available for 139 patients, and posttransplant BAL cultures were available for all patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were the most common organisms cultured. There was a significant correlation between pretransplant sinus and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA (p = 0.003), MRSA (p = 0.013), and Burkholderia cepacia (p = 0.001). There was a high correlation between pretransplant sinus cultures and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA, MRSA, and Burkholderia sp. This suggests that the paranasal sinuses may act as a reservoir for allograft colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of sinusitis affects allograft colonization and transplant outcomes.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

There was a significant correlation between pretransplant sinus and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA (p = 0.003), MRSA (p = 0.013), and Burkholderia cepacia (p = 0.001). There was a high correlation between pretransplant sinus cultures and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA, MRSA, and Burkholderia sp. This suggests that the paranasal sinuses may act as a reservoir for allograft colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of sinusitis affects allograft colonization and transplant outcomes.
29253907	Inhibiting DPP4 in a mouse model of HHT1 results in a shift towards regenerative macrophages and reduces fibrosis after myocardial infarction	Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia type-1 (HHT1) is a genetic vascular disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the TGFβ co-receptor endoglin. Dysfunctional homing of HHT1 mononuclear cells (MNCs) towards the infarcted myocardium hampers cardiac recovery. HHT1-MNCs have elevated expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), which inhibits recruitment of CXCR4-expressing MNCs by inactivation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). We hypothesize that inhibiting DPP4 will restore homing of HHT1-MNCs to the infarcted heart and improve cardiac recovery. After inducing myocardial infarction (MI), wild type (WT) and endoglin heterozygous (Eng+/-) mice were treated for 5 days with the DPP4 inhibitor Diprotin A (DipA). DipA increased the number of CXCR4+ MNCs residing in the infarcted Eng+/- hearts (Eng+/- 73.17±12.67 vs. Eng+/- treated 157.00±11.61, P = 0.0003) and significantly reduced infarct size (Eng+/- 46.60±9.33% vs. Eng+/- treated 27.02±3.04%, P = 0.03). Echocardiography demonstrated that DipA treatment slightly deteriorated heart function in Eng+/- mice. An increased number of capillaries (Eng+/- 61.63±1.43 vs. Eng+/- treated 74.30±1.74, P = 0.001) were detected in the infarct border zone whereas the number of arteries was reduced (Eng+/- 11.88±0.63 vs. Eng+/- treated 6.38±0.97, P = 0.003). Interestingly, while less M2 regenerative macrophages were present in Eng+/- hearts prior to DipA treatment, (WT 29.88±1.52% vs. Eng+/- 12.34±1.64%, P<0.0001), DPP4 inhibition restored the number of M2 macrophages to wild type levels. In this study, we demonstrate that systemic DPP4 inhibition restores the impaired MNC homing in Eng+/- animals post-MI, and enhances cardiac repair, which might be explained by restoring the balance between the inflammatory and regenerative macrophages present in the heart.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

Clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, and brain MRI data analysis. Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 95 epilepsy gene panel. The mean age at seizure onset was 11 months. The mean follow-up of 11.3 years documented that 4 patients following an infantile phase of frequent seizures became seizure free; the mean age at seizure offset was 4.25 years. Epilepsy phenotypes comprised West syndrome in 2 patients, infantile-onset unspecified generalized epilepsy, myoclonic and photosensitive eyelid myoclonia epilepsy resembling Jeavons syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and focal epilepsy with prolonged occipital or clonic seizures in each and every one. Five patients had developmental delay prior to seizure onset evolving into severe intellectual disability with absent speech and autistic traits in one and stereotypic hand movements with impulse control disorder in another. The patient with Jeavons syndrome evolved into moderate intellectual disability. Mutations were de novo, 4 missense and 2 nonsense, 5 were novel, and 1 resulted from somatic mosaicism. KCNB1-related manifestations include a spectrum of infantile-onset generalized or focal seizures whose combination leads to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy including West, Lennox-Gastaut, and Jeavons syndromes. Long-term follow-up highlights that following a stormy phase, seizures subside or cease and treatment may be eased or withdrawn. Cognitive and motor functions are almost always delayed prior to seizure onset and evolve into severe, persistent impairment. Thus, KCNB1 mutations are associated with diffuse brain dysfunction combining seizures, motor, and cognitive impairment.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

29305977	Functional analysis of a novel ENG variant in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) identifies a new Sp1 binding-site	Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide incidence of about 1: 5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1, which code for ENDOGLIN and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signalling pathway. Typical HHT clinical features are mucocutaneous telangiectases, arteriovenous malformations, spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, as well as gastrointestinal bleedings. An additional, but less frequent, clinical manifestation in some HHT patients is the presence of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The aim of this work is to describe the functional role of a novel ENG intronic variant found in a patient affected by both HHT and PAH, in order to assess whether it has a pathogenic role. We proved that the variant lies in a novel binding-site for the transcription factor Sp1, known to be involved in the regulation of ENG and ACVRL1 transcription. We confirmed a pathogenic role for this intronic variant, as it significantly reduces ENG transcription by affecting this novel Sp1 binding-site.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

29313709	Association of High-Dose Ibuprofen Use, Lung Function Decline, and Long-Term Survival in Children with Cystic Fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis deaths result primarily from lung function loss, so chronic respiratory therapies, intended to preserve lung function, are cornerstones of cystic fibrosis care. Although treatment-associated reduction in rate of lung function loss should ultimately improve cystic fibrosis survival, no such relationship has been described for any chronic cystic fibrosis therapy. In part, this is because the ages of most rapid lung function decline-early adolescence-precede the median age of cystic fibrosis deaths by more than a decade. To study associations of high-dose ibuprofen treatment with the rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline and mortality among children followed in the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis and subsequently in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. We performed a matched cohort study using data from Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis. Exposure was defined as high-dose ibuprofen use reported at ≥80% of encounters over 2 years. Unexposed children were matched to exposed children 5:1 using propensity scores on the basis of demographic, clinical, and treatment covariates. The rate of decline of percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second during the 2-year follow-up period was estimated by mixed-effects modeling with random slopes and intercepts. Survival over 16 follow-up years in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry was compared between treatment groups by using proportional hazards modeling controlling for matching and covariates. We included 775 high-dose ibuprofen users and 3,665 nonusers who were well matched on demographic, clinical, and treatment variables. High-dose ibuprofen users declined on average 1.10 percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second/yr (95% confidence interval; 0.51, 1.69) during the 2-year treatment period, whereas nonusers declined at a rate of 1.76% percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second/yr (95% confidence interval; 1.48, 2.04) during the corresponding 2-year period, a 37.5% slower decline among users compared with nonusers (95% confidence interval; 0.4%, 71.3%; P = 0.046). The users had better subsequent survival (P < 0.001): the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for mortality (high-dose ibuprofen/non-high-dose ibuprofen) (95% confidence interval) were 0.75 (0.64, 0.87) and 0.82 (0.69, 0.96). In a propensity-score matched cohort study of children with cystic fibrosis, we observed an association between high-dose ibuprofen use and both slower lung function decline and improved long-term survival. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that treatment-associated reduction of lung function decline in children with cystic fibrosis leads to improved survival.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

29314583	Novel mutations and phenotypes of epilepsy-associated genes in epileptic encephalopathies	Epileptic encephalopathies are severe epilepsy disorders with strong genetic bases. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 70 patients with epileptic encephalopathies. The likely pathogenicity of variants in candidate genes was evaluated by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) scoring taken together with the accepted clinical presentation. Thirty-three candidate variants were detected after population filtration and computational prediction. According to ACMG, 21 candidate variants, including 18 de novo variants, were assessed to be pathogenic/likely pathogenic with clinical concordance. Twelve variants were initially assessed as uncertain significance by ACMG, among which 3 were considered causative and 3 others were considered possibly causative after analysis of clinical concordance. In total, 24 variants were identified as putatively causative, among which 19 were novel findings. SCN1A mutations were identified in 50% of patients with Dravet syndrome. TSC1/TSC2 mutations were detected in 66.7% of patients with tuberous sclerosis. STXBP1 mutations were the main findings in patients with West syndrome. Mutations in SCN2A, KCNT1, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were identified in patients with epileptic infantile with migrating focal seizures; among them, KCNQ2 and CLCN4 were first identified as potential causative genes. Only one CHD2 mutation was detected in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study highlighted the utility of targeted NGS in genetic diagnoses of epileptic encephalopathies and a comprehensive evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants based on ACMG scoring and assessment of clinical concordance. Epileptic encephalopathies differ in genetic causes, and the genotype-phenotype correlations would provide insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

29363096	Electroclinical findings and long-term outcomes in epileptic patients with inv dup (15)	To define the electroclinical phenotype and long-term outcomes in a cohort of patients with inv dup (15) syndrome. The electroclinical data of 45 patients (25 males) affected by inv dup (15) and seizures were retrospectively analysed, and long-term follow-up of epilepsy was evaluated. Epilepsy onset was marked by generalized seizures in 53% of patients, epileptic spasms in 51%, focal seizures in 26%, atypical absences in 11% and epileptic falls in 9%. The epileptic syndromes defined were: generalized epilepsy (26.7%), focal epilepsy (22.3%), epileptic encephalopathy with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type (17.7%) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (33.3%). Drug-resistant epilepsy was detected in 55.5% of patients. There was a significant higher prevalence of seizure-free patients in those with seizure onset after the age of 5 years and with focal epilepsy, with respect to those with earlier epilepsy onset because most of these later developed an epileptic encephalopathy (69.2% vs 34.4%; P = .03), usually Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in type. In fact, among patients with early-onset epilepsy, those presenting with epileptic spasms as the only seizure type associated with classical hypsarrhythmia achieved seizure freedom (P < .001) compared to patients with spasms and other seizure types associated with modified hypsarrhythmia. Epilepsy in inv dup (15) leads to a more severe burden of disease. Frequently, these patients show drug resistance, in particular when epilepsy onset is before the age of five and features epileptic encephalopathy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

29395273	Cannabidiol in patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (GWPCARE4): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial	Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a rare, severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, are frequently treatment resistant to available medications. No controlled studies have investigated the use of cannabidiol for patients with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol as an add-on anticonvulsant therapy in this population of patients. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done at 24 clinical sites in the USA, the Netherlands, and Poland, we investigated the efficacy of cannabidiol as add-on therapy for drop seizures in patients with treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients (aged 2-55 years) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, including a history of slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns on electroencephalogram, evidence of more than one type of generalised seizure for at least 6 months, at least two drop seizures per week during the 4-week baseline period, and had not responded to treatment with at least two antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice response system, stratified by age group, to receive 20 mg/kg oral cannabidiol daily or matched placebo for 14 weeks. All patients, caregivers, investigators, and individuals assessing data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in monthly frequency of drop seizures during the treatment period, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had post-baseline efficacy data. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02224690. Between April 28, 2015, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 171 patients to receive cannabidiol (n=86) or placebo (n=85). 14 patients in the cannabidiol group and one in the placebo group discontinued study treatment; all randomly assigned patients received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline efficacy data. The median percentage reduction in monthly drop seizure frequency from baseline was 43·9% (IQR -69·6 to -1·9) in the cannibidiol group and 21·8% (IQR -45·7 to 1·7) in the placebo group. The estimated median difference between the treatment groups was -17·21 (95% CI -30·32 to -4·09; p=0·0135) during the 14-week treatment period. Adverse events occurred in 74 (86%) of 86 patients in the cannabidiol group and 59 (69%) of 85 patients in the placebo group; most were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, somnolence, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and vomiting. 12 (14%) patients in the cannabidiol group and one (1%) patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events. One patient (1%) died in the cannabidiol group, but this was considered unrelated to treatment. Add-on cannabidiol is efficacious for the treatment of patients with drop seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is generally well tolerated. The long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol is currently being assessed in the open-label extension of this trial. GW Pharmaceuticals.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

29405664	Comparison of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage findings in three types of suppurative lung disease	Endobronchial suppuration is present in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis (CF). However, no studies have directly compared bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings across these conditions within a single center using the same techniques and with shared community pathogens. To determine; (i) the bronchoscopic findings and BAL microbiology and cellularity among children with these conditions and; (ii) the relationship between bacterial pathogens, airway cellularity and aberrant macroscopic bronchoscopic findings. We retrospectively reviewed all bronchoscopy data (undertaken over 6.5-years) from our center in children (<6 years; n = 316) meeting definitions of PBB (n = 125), bronchiectasis (n = 138), and CF (n = 53). The children's median age was 26-months (Interquartile range (IQR) = 16-43). Children with PBB and bronchiectasis had higher rates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, whereas children with CF had frequent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus infections. Novel findings include detection of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (by polymerase chain reaction) in children with PBB (26%, 17%, respectively) and bronchiectasis (27%, 29%). Median airway neutrophil percentage was significantly higher in CF (68%; IQR = 42-83) compared to PBB (36%; IQR = 18-68) and bronchiectasis (22%; IQR = 8-64) (P < 0.0001), despite lower rates of infection. Presence of malacia did not significantly impact on infection or inflammation. In this first study to directly compare bronchoscopic data among young children with PBB, bronchiectasis, and CF, microbiological patterns of airway infections and neutrophilia varied. Our findings of cytomegalovirus and EBV detection in children with PBB and bronchiectasis require confirmation and further evaluation.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

The children's median age was 26-months (Interquartile range (IQR) = 16-43). Children with PBB and bronchiectasis had higher rates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, whereas children with CF had frequent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus infections. Novel findings include detection of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (by polymerase chain reaction) in children with PBB (26%, 17%, respectively) and bronchiectasis (27%, 29%). Median airway neutrophil percentage was significantly higher in CF (68%; IQR = 42-83) compared to PBB (36%; IQR = 18-68) and bronchiectasis (22%; IQR = 8-64) (P < 0.0001), despite lower rates of infection. Presence of malacia did not significantly impact on infection or inflammation. In this first study to directly compare bronchoscopic data among young children with PBB, bronchiectasis, and CF, microbiological patterns of airway infections and neutrophilia varied. Our findings of cytomegalovirus and EBV detection in children with PBB and bronchiectasis require confirmation and further evaluation.
29416304	Anesthesia management of a patient with a femoral neck fracture and hered-itary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels due to mutations in specific genes that lead to angiogenesis errors. HHT represents a clinical entity with great clinical interest as severe, unpredicted, and life-threatening bleeding, sepsis, ischemia, and hemodynamic failure might occur. Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. **Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, **at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle. The patient was in lateral position with close monitoring of her blood pressure, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and urine output. Two units of blood were transfused perioperatively. Her recovery was uneventful and she was discharged after ten days. Patients with HHT require careful preoperative evaluation to identify and appreciate possible symptoms as well as to assess their pulmonary and cardiac function accurately. Meticulous preoperative planning is required to minimize perioperative risks and additionally close perioperative monitoring is essential. RA was preferred to general anesthesia as positive pressure ventilation could lead to hypoxia, AVM rupture, embolism, and hemodynamic collapse, while RA offers absence of respiratory stress, excellent muscle relaxation, and decreases blood loss, lowers probability of venal thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and assists to better perioperative management of analgesia, thus contributing to positive outcome of surgery.

29454607	Italian Wikipedia and epilepsy: An infodemiological study of online information-seeking behavior	Wikipedia is the most commonly accessed source of health information by both healthcare professionals and the lay public worldwide. We aimed to evaluate information-seeking behavior of Internet users searching the Italian Wikipedia for articles related to epilepsy and its treatment. Using Pageviews Analysis, we assessed the total and mean monthly views of articles from the Italian Wikipedia devoted to epilepsy, epileptic syndromes, seizure type, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017. We compared the views of the article on epilepsy with those of articles focusing on Alzheimer's disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, syncope, and stroke and adjusted all results for crude disease prevalence. With the only exception of the article on multiple sclerosis, the adjusted views for the Italian Wikipedia article on epilepsy were higher than those for the other neurological disorders. The most viewed articles on seizure type were devoted to tonic-clonic seizure, typical absence seizure, tonic convulsive seizures, and clonic convulsive seizures. The most frequently accessed articles on epilepsy syndromes were about temporal lobe epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The most frequently viewed articles on AEDs were devoted to valproic acid, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam. Wikipedia searches seem to mirror patients' fears and worries about epilepsy more than its actual epidemiology. The ultimate reasons for searching online remain unknown. Epileptologists and epilepsy scientific societies should make greater efforts to work jointly with Wikipedia to convey more accurate and up-to-date information about epilepsy.

29459061	Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy evolving to contralateral hemi-Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype	"Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) involves infantile-onset acute hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus with subsequent unilateral cerebral atrophy and hemiparesis. Chronic epilepsy later develops, typically involving refractory focal seizures; however, the underlying pathophysiology of this epilepsy is not well understood. We present a boy who had a typical acute presentation of HHE at 23 months, but an unusual evolution to chronic epilepsy in which the initially unaffected hemisphere was significantly abnormal. His initial acute presentation was right-sided hemiconvulsive febrile status epilepticus, with subsequent left cerebral hemiatrophy and hemiparesis affecting the right face, arm and leg. Focal seizures began at 5 years and were refractory to medical treatment. At 9 years, video EEG monitoring showed a striking pattern of interictal slow spike-wave and paroxysmal fast activity, maximal over the right, initially unaffected, hemisphere. He had primarily focal tonic seizures involving left-sided stiffening, also appearing to originate from the right hemisphere. Following left functional hemispherotomy he became seizure-free and parents reported improved cognitive function, attention and quality of life. This boy had classic features of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but expressed almost exclusively over the right hemisphere, which was initially unaffected in his acute presentation of HHE. His evolution to ""hemi-Lennox-Gastaut-like phenotype"" illustrates the importance of monitoring chronic epilepsy in patients with HHE; early surgical intervention might prevent pathologic recruitment of bilateral secondary networks leading to the refractory seizures and cognitive impairment associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome."

29460088	Vascular deficiency of Smad4 causes arteriovenous malformations: a mouse model of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that leads to abnormal connections between arteries and veins termed arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Mutations in TGFβ pathway members ALK1, ENG and SMAD4 lead to HHT. However, a Smad4 mouse model of HHT does not currently exist. We aimed to create and characterize a Smad4 endothelial cell (EC)-specific, inducible knockout mouse (Smad4f/f;Cdh5-CreERT2) that could be used to study AVM development in HHT. We found that postnatal ablation of Smad4 caused various vascular defects, including the formation of distinct AVMs in the neonate retina. Our analyses demonstrated that increased EC proliferation and size, altered mural cell coverage and distorted artery-vein gene expression are associated with Smad4 deficiency in the vasculature. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Smad4 leads to decreased Vegfr2 expression, and concurrent loss of endothelial Smad4 and Vegfr2 in vivo leads to AVM enlargement. Our work provides a new model in which to study HHT-associated phenotypes and links the TGFβ and VEGF signaling pathways in AVM pathogenesis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

29467376	Changes in functional brain network topology after successful and unsuccessful corpus callosotomy for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome	Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an effective palliative surgical treatment for patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). However, research on the long-term functional effects of CC is sparse. We aimed to investigate these effects and their associated clinical conditions over the two years after CC. Long-term clinical EEG recordings of 30 patients with LGS who had good and bad seizure outcome after CC were collected and retrospectively studied. It was found that CC caused brain network 'hubs' to shift from paramedian to lateral regions in the good-recovery group, which reorganized the brain network into a more homogeneous state. We also found increased local clustering coefficients in patients with bad outcomes and decreases, implying enhanced network integration, in patients with good outcomes. The small worldness of brain networks in patients with good outcomes increased in the two years after CC, whereas it decreased in patients with bad outcomes. The covariation of small-worldness with the rate of reduction in seizure frequency suggests that this can be used as an indicator of CC outcome. Local and global network changes during the long-term state might be associated with the postoperative recovery process and could serve as indicators for CC outcome and long-term LGS recovery.

Nine newly diagnosed HHT-PAH patients were prospectively recruited between October 2007 and January 2016 and were followed up every half-year. Eighteen idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients, matched with HHT-PAH patients on mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, and World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), were recruited. **The clinical characteristics of HHT-PAH patients were described and the prognosis of these two cohorts were compared.** Of HHT-PAH patients, 55.56% were WHO FC III. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed one- and three-year survival rates of HHT-PAH patients were 77.8% and 53.3% respectively, which were worse than matched IPAH patients (log rank: P = 0.047). HHT-PAH patients had higher red cell distribution width (14.88 ± 2.93% versus 13.19 ± 0.83%, P = 0.031), larger right ventricular anteroposterior diameter (34.67 ± 6.67 mm versus 28.56 ± 6.35 mm, P = 0.029), and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (317.38 ± 17.71 g/L versus 335.72 ± 14.68 g/L, P = 0.011) than matched IPAH patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed baseline total bilirubin independently predicted the mortality of HHT-PAH after adjusting by age, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, or serum uric acid.

Brain AVMs typically present at birth and are identified in approximately 10-20% of patients with HHT. A retrospective review was undertaken of all HHT patients with known single or multiple brain AVMs treated at our institution. Thirty-nine patients with brain AVM(s) were diagnosed with HHT. Most patients presented with at least one Curaçao criterion. A total of 78 brain AVMs were identified in 39 patients. Two-thirds of patients had solitary brain AVMs, whereas 33% of patients harbored at least two lesions (range: 2-16). Brain AVMs of the supratentorial cerebral hemispheres comprised 83% of all lesions, whereas infratentorial lesions accounted for only 17%. Of the 55 brain AVMs assigned Spetzler-Martin grading, the majority of patients were Grade 1 (73%), and 23% and 4% were Grades 2 and 3, respectively. Patients were treated with surgery alone (51%), embolization alone (6%), embolization followed by surgery (9%), stereotactic radiosurgery (11%), stereotactic radiosurgery followed by surgery (3%), or observation (20%). Of patients who underwent genetic analysis, 62% possessed mutations in ENG (HHT type 1), whereas 38% had mutations in ACVRL1 (HHT type 2).

The liver is a commonly involved organ (74% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), although symptomatic liver disease is quite infrequent. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifestations relate most commonly to the predominant type of vascular shunting present (arteriovenous, arterioportal, or portovenous). Clinically, liver disease can manifest as a high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, or biliary disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up of liver involvement, with ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography being useful in this context. We present a case of congestive cirrhosis with florid liver findings in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Imaging findings that clinched the diagnosis are reviewed.

29558884	Few individuals with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have autism spectrum disorder: a comparison with Dravet syndrome	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in epilepsy has been a topic of increasing interest, which in general occurs in 15-35% of the patients with epilepsy, more frequently in those with intellectual disability (ID). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are two typical forms of intractable epileptic encephalopathy associated with ID. We previously reported that ASD was diagnosed in 24.3% of patients with DS, higher in those with profound ID. Given the severe epilepsy and high frequency of ID in LGS, it is necessary to know whether ASD is a common psychomotor co-morbidity of LGS. This study evaluated the autistic behaviors and intelligence in patients with LGS and further compared that between LGS and DS, aiming to understand the complex pathogenesis of epilepsy-ASD-ID triad. A total of 50 patients with LGS and 45 patients with DS were enrolled and followed up for at least 3 years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and evaluations of ASD and ID were performed. No patients with LGS fully met the diagnostic criteria for ASD, but three of them exhibited more or less autistic behaviors. Majority (86%) of LGS patients presented ID, among which moderate to severe ID was the most common. Early onset age and symptomatic etiology were risk predictors for ID. The prevalence of ASD in LGS was significantly lower than that in DS (0/50 vs. 10/45, p < 0.001), while the prevalence and severity of ID showed no significant difference between the two forms of epileptic encephalopathy. This study demonstrated a significant difference in the co-morbidity of ASD between LGS and DS, although they had a similar prevalence and severity of ID, refuting the proposal that the prevalence of ASD in epilepsy is accounted for by ID. These findings suggest that the co-morbidity of ASD, ID, and epilepsy may result from multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

29560543	Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation improves lung function in cystic fibrosis patients chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a pilot cross-over study	High levels of shear stress can prevent and disrupt Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation in vitro. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) could be used to introduce shear stress into the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to disrupt biofilms in vivo. We performed a first-of-its-kind pilot clinical study to evaluate short-term IPV therapy at medium (200 bursts per minute, bpm) and high frequency (400 bpm) as compared to autogenic drainage (AD) on lung function and the behavior of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung in four patients who are chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. A significant difference between the three treatment groups was observed for both the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) (p < 0.05). More specifically, IPV at high frequency significantly increased FEV1 and FVC compared to AD (p < 0.05) and IPV at medium frequency (p < 0.001). IPV at high frequency enhanced the expression levels of P. aeruginosa planktonic marker genes, which was less pronounced with IPV at medium frequency or AD. In conclusion, IPV at high frequency could potentially alter the behavior of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung and improve lung function. The trail was retrospectively registered at the ISRCTN registry on 6 June 2013, under trial registration number ISRCTN75391385.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

29572268	A transcription factor network represses CFTR  gene expression in airway epithelial cells	Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung disease is the major cause of CF morbidity, though CFTR expression levels are substantially lower in the airway epithelium than in pancreatic duct and intestinal epithelia, which also show compromised function in CF. Recently developed small molecule therapeutics for CF are highly successful for one specific CFTR mutation and have a positive impact on others. However, the low abundance of CFTR transcripts in the airway limits the opportunity for drugs to correct the defective substrate. Elucidation of the transcriptional mechanisms for the CFTR locus has largely focused on intragenic and intergenic tissue-specific enhancers and their activating trans-factors. Here, we investigate whether the low CFTR levels in the airway epithelium result from the recruitment of repressive proteins directly to the locus. Using an siRNA screen to deplete ∼1500 transcription factors (TFs) and associated regulatory proteins in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, we identified nearly 40 factors that upon depletion elevated CFTR mRNA levels more than 2-fold. A subset of these TFs was validated in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Among the strongest repressors of airway expression of CFTR were Krüppel-like factor 5 and Ets homologous factor, both of which have pivotal roles in the airway epithelium. Depletion of these factors, which are both recruited to an airway-selective cis-regulatory element at -35 kb from the CFTR promoter, improved CFTR production and function, thus defining novel therapeutic targets for enhancement of CFTR.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

29593101	Thalidomide Reduces Hemorrhage of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in a Mouse Model	Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is an important risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage. Current treatments for bAVM are all associated with considerable risks. There is no safe method to prevent bAVM hemorrhage. Thalidomide reduces nose bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an inherited disorder characterized by vascular malformations. In this study, we tested whether thalidomide and its less toxic analog, lenalidomide, reduce bAVM hemorrhage using a mouse model. bAVMs were induced through induction of brain focal activin-like kinase 1 (Alk1, an AVM causative gene) gene deletion and angiogenesis in adult Alk1-floxed mice. Thalidomide was injected intraperitoneally twice per week for 6 weeks, starting either 2 or 8 weeks after AVM induction. Lenalidomide was injected intraperitoneally daily starting 8 weeks after AVM induction for 6 weeks. Brain samples were collected at the end of the treatments for morphology, mRNA, and protein analyses. The influence of Alk1 downregulation on PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor B) expression was also studied on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells. The effect of PDGFB in mural cell recruitment in bAVM was explored by injection of a PDGFB overexpressing lentiviral vector to the mouse brain. Thalidomide or lenalidomide treatment reduced the number of dysplastic vessels and hemorrhage and increased mural cell (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes) coverage in the bAVM lesion. Thalidomide reduced the burden of CD68+ cells and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the bAVM lesions. PDGFB expression was reduced in ALK1-knockdown human brain microvascular endothelial cells and in mouse bAVM lesion. Thalidomide increased Pdgfb expression in bAVM lesion. Overexpression of PDGFB mimicked the effect of thalidomide. Thalidomide and lenalidomide improve mural cell coverage of bAVM vessels and reduce bAVM hemorrhage, which is likely through upregulation of Pdgfb expression.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

29610574	Impact of Age on Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	There is little published literature regarding the impact of age on outcomes amongst hospitalized HHT (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) patients. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to obtain data on all hospital discharges occurring in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012. The association between admission age and HHT-related complications and outcomes were studied. 10293 hospitalizations in HHT patients from 2000 to 2012 were included. Patients > 50 accounted for 77% of all admissions with 30% of admissions occurring in the 51-65 age group. Bleeding related complications were the most frequent (62.7%,n= 6455 hospitalizations), followed by cardiovascular (41%,n= 4216), neurological (12.4%,n= 1276), and hepatobiliary (6.4%,n= 660) complications. Patients older than 50 accounted for 83% of bleeding events, 90% of cardiovascular events, 58% of neurologic events, and 81% of hepatobiliary events. The vast majority (83%) of medical and surgical procedures were performed in those older than 50 years of age. Older patients also experienced higher rates of death. Aging has significant adverse impacts on rates of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes amongst HHT patients in the United States. Except for neurologic complications, the vast majority of this disease burden is borne by patients older than 50 years.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

We identify a recurrent de novo CUX2 p.Glu590Lys as a novel genetic cause for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). The de novo p.Glu590Lys variant was identified by whole-exome sequencing (n = 5) or targeted gene panel (n = 4). We performed electroclinical and imaging phenotyping on all patients. The cohort comprised 7 males and 2 females. Mean age at study was 13 years (0.5-21.0). Median age at seizure onset was 6 months (2 months to 9 years). Seizure types at onset were myoclonic, atypical absence with myoclonic components, and focal seizures. Epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram was seen in 8 cases: generalized polyspike-wave (6) or multifocal discharges (2). Seizures were drug resistant in 7 or controlled with valproate (2). Six patients had a DEE: myoclonic DEE (3), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (2), and West syndrome (1). Two had a static encephalopathy and genetic generalized epilepsy, including absence epilepsy in 1. One infant had multifocal epilepsy. Eight had severe cognitive impairment, with autistic features in 6. The p.Glu590Lys variant affects a highly conserved glutamine residue in the CUT domain predicted to interfere with CUX2 binding to DNA targets during neuronal development. Patients with CUX2 p.Glu590Lys display a distinctive phenotypic spectrum, which is predominantly generalized epilepsy, with infantile-onset myoclonic DEE at the severe end and generalized epilepsy with severe static developmental encephalopathy at the milder end of the spectrum.

29655863	Applicability of the Curaçao Criteria for the Diagnosis of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia in the Pediatric Population	To evaluate the accuracy of the clinical Curaçao criteria in the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) in children and adolescents. This was a retrospective, multicenter chart review of 673 patients evaluated between 2002 and 2016; 290 were eligible for the study. Genetic testing for a pathogenic mutation was considered the gold standard against which the clinical Curaçao criteria were compared. Patients were divided into 4 age categories: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-21-years. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each age group, and for the overall population. Overall the Curaçao criteria had a sensitivity of 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 91%-100%). Sensitivity was lowest in the 0- to 5-year group, and increased with advancing age. The Curaçao criteria had the highest sensitivity in the 16- to 21-year-olds. Specificity was 100% in all age groups except for the 11- to 15-year-olds. This study evaluated the use of the Curaçao criteria for the diagnosis of HHT in the pediatric population with a family history of HHT. In those between the age of 0 and 21 years who meet 1 criterion (unlikely HHT) or 2 criteria (possible HHT), genetic testing is preferred for diagnosis. The Curaçao criteria appear to reliably diagnose HHT in children and adolescents who meet 3 or 4 criteria (definite HHT).	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

29720915	Resource Use Evaluation of Tobramycin Formulations in a State Medicaid Program	Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) often suffer from chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For patients with CF, 6 years of age and older, with P aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin to reduce exacerbations. To ease treatment burden, a new dry powder formulation was developed. The objective of this research was to compare resource utilization between tobramycin inhaled solution (TIS) and a new tobramycin dry powder (TIP) formulation in a state Medicaid program. Members that switched from TIS to TIP were matched to TIS-only beneficiaries via propensity score based on age, sex, race, and residence location. The outcomes (tobramycin reimbursement, inpatient hospital reimbursement, additional antibiotic therapy reimbursement, length of inpatient stays, odds of adherence, odds of inpatient hospital stay, and additional mean days of antibiotic therapy) were assessed by using multivariable regression and included baseline clinical surrogates. No difference was found between 54 matched members for tobramycin reimbursement, length of inpatient stays, odds of adherence, or odds of hospital stay. Cost of additional antibiotic therapy was higher for TIP (+$518, p < 0.001) and inpatient reimbursement was higher for TIS (+$503, p = 0.031). Additional mean days of antibiotic therapy were lower for TIP (8.6 vs. 10.1, p = 0.374), but was not statistically significant. In patients that switched from TIS to TIP, an increase in cost of additional antibiotic therapy was observed, while inpatient costs were lower. Research should be considered in larger populations to fully determine the impact of the new dry powder formulation on overall resource use and outcomes.	cystic fibrosis			328	Resource Use Evaluation of Tobramycin Formulations in a State Medicaid Program.

29743243	CFTR/ENaC-dependent regulation of membrane potential during human sperm capacitation is initiated by bicarbonate uptake through NBC	To fertilize an egg, sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract to undergo several maturational changes that are collectively referred to as capacitation. From a molecular point of view, the HCO3--dependent activation of the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (ADCY10) is one of the first events that occurs during capacitation and leads to the subsequent cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Capacitation is also accompanied by hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. We previously reported that PKA activation is necessary for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel) activity and for the modulation of membrane potential (Em). However, the main HCO3- transporters involved in the initial transport and the PKA-dependent Em changes are not well known nor characterized. Here, we analyzed how the activity of CFTR regulates Em during capacitation and examined its relationship with an electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC) and epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs). We observed that inhibition of both CFTR and NBC decreased HCO3- influx, resulting in lower PKA activity, and that events downstream of the cAMP activation of PKA are essential for the regulation of Em. Addition of a permeable cAMP analog partially rescued the inhibitory effects caused by these inhibitors. HCO3- also produced a rapid membrane hyperpolarization mediated by ENaC channels, which contribute to the regulation of Em during capacitation. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time, that NBC cotransporters and ENaC channels are essential in the CFTR-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and Em regulation during human sperm capacitation.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

29768152	Effect of Cannabidiol on Drop Seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome	Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560 .).

Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560 .).
29886024	Ivacaftor treatment of cystic fibrosis in children aged 12 to <24 months and with a CFTR gating mutation (ARRIVAL): a phase 3 single-arm study	Ivacaftor is generally safe and effective in patients aged 2 years and older who have cystic fibrosis and specific CFTR mutations. We assessed its use in children aged 12 to <24 months. The ARRIVAL study is a phase 3, single-arm, two-part, multicentre study. Eligible children were aged 12 to <24 months at enrolment and had a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a CFTR gating mutation on at least one allele and could participate in one or both parts of the study. Children received 50 mg (bodyweight 7 to <14 kg) or 75 mg (bodyweight ≥14 to <25 kg) ivacaftor orally every 12 h. In study part A, children received ivacaftor for 3 days plus one morning. In study part B, children received 24 weeks of treatment. Children were enrolled into part A at seven sites in Australia (one site), the UK (one), and the USA (five) and into part B at 13 sites in Australia (two sites), Canada (one), the UK (three), and the USA (seven). Primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (parts A and B) in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part B were pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of ivacaftor and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration. We also explored changes in growth parameters and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02725567. Children aged 12 to <24 months were enrolled between Aug 25, 2016, and Nov 1, 2017. Seven children were enrolled in part A, of whom five received 50 mg and two received 75 mg ivacaftor. All completed treatment. Of 19 children enrolled in part B, including one from part A, all received 50 mg ivacaftor and 18 completed treatment (one withdrew because of difficulty with blood draws). All children received at least one dose of ivacaftor. Pharmacokinetics indicated exposure was similar to that in children aged 2 to <6 years and adults. No children discontinued because of adverse events or safety findings. In part A, three (43%) of seven children had treatment-emergent adverse events, all of which were mild and deemed not to be or unlikely to be related to ivacaftor. By 24 weeks in part B, treatment-emergent adverse events had been reported in 18 (95%) of 19 children, of which most were mild or moderate and the most frequent was cough (14 [74%] children). Two children in part B had four serious adverse events: one had constipation (possibly related to ivacaftor), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and eczema herpeticum, and one had persistent cough, all needing hospital admission. In five (28%) of 18 children aspartate or alanine aminotransferase concentrations rose to more than three times the upper limit of normal (to more than eight times in two children with concurrent infections). At week 24, the mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride concentration was -73·5 (SD 17·5) mmol/L. Growth parameters for age were normal at baseline and at week 24. At week 24, concentrations of faecal elastase-1 had increased and concentrations of immunoreactive trypsinogen had decreased from baseline. Mean serum lipase and amylase were raised at baseline and rapidly decreased after treatment was started. Ivacaftor was generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 12 to <24 months for up to 24 weeks and was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in sweat chloride concentrations. Improvements in biomarkers of pancreatic function suggest that ivacaftor preserves exocrine pancreatic function if started early. The study is continuing in infants younger than 12 months.

29906696	Ictal signs in tuberous sclerosis complex: Clinical and video-EEG features in a large series of recorded seizures	Epilepsy is the most common neurological symptom in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), occurring in 72-85% of affected individuals. Despite the large number of patients reported, their electroclinical phenotype has been rarely described. We analyzed seizure semiology through ictal video-electroencephalography (V-EEG) recordings in a large series of patients. **In this multicenter study, we reviewed V-EEGs of 51 patients: ictal recordings were analyzed in correlation with their clinical variables**. The median age of epilepsy onset was six months (one day-16 years), with onset in the first year of life in 71% patients (36/51), in 10 of them during the neonatal period. Sixty-five percent of patients (33/51) experienced epileptic spasms in their life, with late-onset (>two years) in five; 42% of the epileptic spasms persisted after age two years, despite the onset in the first year of life. We identified four different electroclinical subsets: focal epilepsy (35%, 18/51), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome evolution (27%, 14/51), focal seizures with persisting spasms (33%, 17/51), and spasms only (4%, 2/51). We reviewed 45 focal seizures, 13 clusters of epileptic spasms, and seven generalized seizures. In 12 patients, we recorded different seizure types. In 71% of the focal seizures (32/45), the ictal pattern was focal without diffusion. In 38% of the patients (5/13) epileptic spasms were related to typical diffuse slow wave pattern associated with superimposed fast activity, with focal predominance. Focal seizures and focal spasms resulted as the most frequent seizure types in TSC. Seizure onset was variable but showing a predominant involvement of the frontocentral regions (40%). Discrete clinical signs characterized the seizures, and behavioral arrest was the predominant first clinical objective sign. Epileptic spasms were a typical presentation at all ages, frequently asymmetrical and associated with lateralizing features, especially in older patients.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

29938556	Prenatal care and labor in patients with mesenchimal dysplasias (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)	Background: Mesenchymal dysplasias or inherited connective tissue diseases are the group of diseases with deficiency of various components of connective tissue. Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton, sight organ, skin, lungs, heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage, especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels.Aim: To evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias.Study design: Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias, including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome (I group), 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (II group), and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) (III group) of the age from 18 to 36. The study included retrospective analysis (for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery, especially the risk of hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients, we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations (epistaxis in 27 patients, easy brushing in 22, skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20, gastrointestinal bleedings in 4, hemoptysis in 4, hematomas for minor traumas in 14, conjunctivas hemorrhages in 5).Conclusion: The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage accompany vaginal delivery.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

29948770	Effect of Rufinamide on the kainic acid-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus	Rufinamide (RUF) is a structurally unique anti-epileptic drug, used in the treatment of seizure disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In the present study, we investigated whether RUF protected against excitotoxic neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region after intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection. Treatment with 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg RUF significantly decreased the KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA3 region in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 100 mg/kg RUF treatment reduced the KA-induced oxidative stress-related increase of MDA level and decrease of total SOD activity in the hippocampus. KA-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, levels as well as KA-induced microglial activation were also suppressed by RUF treatment. These results indicate that RUF displays a neuroprotective effect against KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

29968450	Brain cooling reduces the risk of postneonatal epilepsy in newborns affected by moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.	Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is still a significant cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, mental delay, and epilepsy. After the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia, the prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has improved, with reduction of death and disabilities. However, few studies evaluated whether hypothermia affects rate and severity of postneonatal epilepsy. We evaluated rates, characteristics and prognostic markers of postneonatal epilepsy in infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated or not with therapeutic hypothermia. We analyzed clinical data, EEG recordings, cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and outcome in 23 cooled and 26 non-cooled asphyxiated neonates (≥36 weeks' gestation), admitted from 2004 to 2012. Among 49 neonates 11 (22%) had postneonatal epilepsy, of which 9 (18%) were non-cooled and 2 (4%) were cooled (P=0.05). Six of 11 infants (55%) had West syndrome, 4 (36%) had focal epilepsy and 1 (9%) had Lennox-Gas taut Syndrome. At multiple logistic regression analysis MRI pattern significantly correlated with postneonatal epilepsy (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.88, P=0.03). Extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter were associated with postneonatal epilepsy. Only perinatal asphyxia with extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter lesion conveys a high risk for early and severe postneonatal epilepsy. Moreover, therapeutic hypothermia is associated with a decrease of the risk of developing postneonatal epilepsy.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

29982584	Interstitial Stereotactic Laser Anterior Corpus Callosotomy: A Report of 2 Cases with Operative Technique and Effectiveness	Corpus callosotomy is an effective palliative treatment for medically intractable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) that disrupts the interhemispheric synchronization of epileptiform discharges. However, traditional open corpus callosotomy carries a significant risk of surgical complications associated with craniotomy and a parafalcine approach to the corpus callosum. Here, we report 2 cases of anterior corpus callosotomy using MRI-guided stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) as a minimally invasive technique for mitigating the risks of craniotomy while achieving favorable outcomes. Two patients with medically intractable LGS underwent stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy using a 2 laser-fiber approach. Ablation of 70%-80% of the corpus callosum was confirmed by postoperative MRI diffusion tensor imaging and volumetric analysis. Marked reduction of epileptiform activity was observed in both patients during postoperative video-EEG studies as compared to preoperative video-EEG studies. Freedom from disabling seizures including drop attacks was achieved in 1 patient for 18 mo, and more than a 90% reduction of disabling seizures was achieved in the other patient for 7 mo with cognitive improvement and without surgical complications. These early data demonstrate the technical feasibility, safety, and favorable outcomes of MRI-guided stereotactic laser anterior corpus callosotomy in patients with LGS, making it a potentially safe and effective alternative to traditional open corpus callosotomy and other stereotactic methods including radiofrequency ablation and radiosurgery due to the ability to monitor the ablation in real time with MRI.

The most common adverse effects of lacosamide include dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, fatigue, and sedation. Less common side effects include memory impairment, weight gain, rash, and atrioventricular block. In this article, we describe a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who developed excessive laughing as a rare side effect of lacosamide with complete resolution after discontinuation of the medication.

30062052	Guanylate binding proteins facilitate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis in response to type 3 secretion system-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Detection of bacterial ligands is a pre-requisite for inflammasome activation. During Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, flagellin which is secreted through the T3SS is detected by the NLRC4 inflammasome. Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome is believed to contribute to high IL-1β production and pathogenicity in cystic fibrosis patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Interestingly, the majority of P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients with chronic airway infection are non-motile and T3SS-negative, suggesting that yet un-characterized inflammasome pathways regulate IL-1β production in cystic fibrosis patients. Here we demonstrate the role of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) in regulating bacterial proliferation and inflammasome activation in response to T3SS-negative P. aeruginosa. Bacterial ligands liberated by the action of GBP2 and IRGB10 activate caspase-11 and regulate non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release. Overall, our results reveal the role of caspase-11 in inhibiting bacterial proliferation and promoting IL-1β secretion during T3SS-negative P. aeruginosa infection. This study suggests that non canonical inflammasomes might have co-evolved to detect Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that have evolved to bypass detection by canonical NLRs.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Up to 30% of patients with HHT exhibit pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs), clinically manifesting as right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia.** We report an unusual and novel case of a patient with HHT who lacked clinical sequelae of portal hypertension but presented to clinic with hypoxemia without dyspnea.** Diagnostic workup revealed noncardiac right-to-left shunting due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) from HHT-induced portal hypertension rather than PAVMs. The diagnosis was confirmed by the absence of PAVMs on chest computed tomography and evidence of elevated portal pressures as noted by the presence of small esophageal varices on upper endoscopy and histologic findings on liver biopsy. Due to the patient's mild symptoms, no further intervention was required. He was closely followed up in the outpatient setting for changes in symptoms and underwent annual screening for development of PAVMs. The patient continues to do well clinically. He has not experienced worsening hypoxemia or dyspnea and has not developed PAVMs. Given that management of hypoxemia in HPS drastically differs from that of hypoxemia due to PAVMs, this case demonstrates the importance of evaluating HHT patients for HPS if they exhibit impaired oxygenation and noncardiac right-to-leftshunting in the setting of hepatic arteriovenous shunting.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

30100257	Antisense oligonucleotide targeting of mRNAs encoding ENaC subunits α, β, and γ improves cystic fibrosis-like disease in mice	The epithelial sodium channel ENaC consists of three subunits encoded by Scnn1a, Scnn1b, and Scnn1g and increased sodium absorption through this channel is hypothesized to lead to mucus dehydration and accumulation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We identified potent and specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting mRNAs encoding the ENaC subunits and evaluated these ASOs in mouse models of CF-like lung disease. ASOs designed to target mRNAs encoding each ENaC subunit or a control ASO were administered directly into the lungs of mice. The reductions in ENaC subunits correlated well with a reduction in amiloride sensitive channel conductance. In addition, levels of mucus markers Gob5, AGR2, Muc5ac, and Muc5b, periodic acid-Schiff's reagent (PAS) goblet cell staining, and neutrophil recruitment were reduced and lung function was improved when levels of any of the ENaC subunits were decreased. Delivery of ASOs targeting mRNAs encoding each of the three ENaC subunits directly into the lung improved disease phenotypes in a mouse model of CF-like lung disease. These findings suggest that targeting ENaC subunits could be an effective approach for the treatment of CF.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

However, the fitness increase of the mutant bacteria in presence of the relevant antibiotics, as demonstrated in competition experiments between mutant and ancestor bacteria, showed that 1) very small phenotypic changes cause significant fitness increase with severe adaptive consequences, and 2) standardized phenotypic tests fail to detect such low-level variations. The frequent appearance of P. aeruginosa mexZ mutants in CF patients is directly connected to the intense use of the target antibiotics, and low-level antibiotic resistance, if left unnoticed, can result in accumulation of additional genetic changes leading to high-level resistance.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

30146556	Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Patient with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	A 76-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzyme levels, and abdominal imaging studies revealed a hepatic tumor. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 759.5 ng/mL. A pathological examination after hepatectomy confirmed a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An examination of the surrounding liver revealed dilated vessels and thickened endothelial cells without inflammations. HHT patients without other risk factors (like this patient) reportedly have a lower incidence of common cancers, including HCC, in comparison to the unaffected population. One intriguing hypothesis that might explain the hepatocarcinogenesis in this situation is the ischemic liver cirrhosis theory, which suggests that chronic ischemia may cause parenchymal strain and promote inappropriate hepatocyte proliferation.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

30146701	A pilot, open-label study of the effectiveness and tolerability of low-dose ZX008 (fenfluramine HCl) in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a drug-resistant, childhood onset electroclinical epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types and diagnostic electroencephalogram findings. ZX008 (fenfluramine HCl oral solution) was well tolerated and reduced seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome, prompting this phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study of add-on ZX008 in patients with LGS (**NCT02655198)**. Eligible treatment-refractory patients with LGS aged 3-18 years with ≥4 documented convulsive seizures (CS) in the prior 4 weeks were administered adjunctive ZX008 twice daily at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/d, with incremental dose escalations up to 0.8 mg/kg/d or 30 mg/d (maximum dose) every 4 weeks in nonresponders (<50% reduction in CS frequency). After 20 weeks (core study), responders were offered entry into a long-term extension study. Seizures were captured via diary. Cardiac safety was monitored by Doppler echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Thirteen patients were enrolled (mean age = 11.7 years, range = 3-17). Ten (77%) patients completed 20 weeks of ZX008 treatment. During the core study, there was a 53% median reduction (N = 13) in CS; median reduction was 60% in the 10 completers. Eight patients (62%) had a ≥50% CS reduction; three (23%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. Nine (69%) patients entered the long-term extension study. At 15 months (n = 9), median reduction in CS was 58%; six (67%) patients had a ≥50% reduction, and three (33%) patients had a ≥75% reduction. The most common adverse events were decreased appetite (n = 4, 31%) and decreased alertness (n = 2, 15%). No echocardiographic signs of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension were observed. ZX008 provided clinically meaningful reduction (≥50%) in CS frequency in the majority of patients with LGS in this pilot study and was generally well tolerated. A phase 3, randomized, controlled study is ongoing.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

30165811	Whole genome sequencing reveals the emergence of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa shared strain sub-lineage among patients treated within a single cystic fibrosis centre	Chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Shared P. aeruginosa strains, that can be transmitted between patients, are of concern and in Australia the AUST-02 shared strain is predominant in individuals attending CF centres in Queensland and Western Australia. M3L7 is a multidrug resistant sub-type of AUST-02 that was recently identified in a Queensland CF centre and was shown to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The main aim of this study was to resolve the relationship of the emergent M3L7 sub-type within the AUST-02 group of strains using whole genome sequencing. A whole genome core phylogeny of 63 isolates indicated that M3L7 is a monophyletic sub-lineage within the context of the broader AUST-02 group. Relatively short branch lengths connected all of the M3L7 isolates. A phylogeny based on nucleotide polymorphisms present across the genome showed that the chronological estimation of the most recent common ancestor was around 2001 (± 3 years). SNP differences between sequential non-hypermutator M3L7 isolates collected 3-4 years apart from five patients suggested both continuous infection of the same strain and cross-infection of some M3L7 variants between patients. The majority of polymorphisms that were characteristic of M3L7 (i.e. acquired after divergence from all other AUST-02 isolates sequenced) were found to produce non-synonymous mutations in virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. M3L7 has recently diverged from a common ancestor, indicating descent from a single carrier at a CF treatment centre in Australia. Both adaptation to the lung and transmission of M3L7 between adults attending this centre may have contributed to its rapid dissemination. Further genomic investigations are required on multiple intra-sample isolates of this sub-type to decipher potential mechanisms which facilitates its epidemiological success.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

30166208	Rufinamide efficacy and safety in children aged 1-4 years with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	The treatment options for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a pediatric epileptic syndrome, are limited, especially in younger children. Rufinamide tablets were safe and effective as an add-on treatment in Korean children and adolescents <20 years of age with LGS. This subgroup analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rufinamide tablets in LGS pediatric patients aged 1-4 years. This was a retrospective, observational study in LGS patients aged 1-4 years who received 12 weeks of treatment with rufinamide orally as an adjuvant treatment between April and June 2010. The proportion of responders (patients with a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency after rufinamide treatment) was evaluated according to the type of seizure. The proportion of patients who were seizure-free was also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment. Among the 15 patients evaluated, one discontinued treatment because of worsening seizures 4 weeks after administration of rufinamide. Seven (46.67%) patients were responders and four patients were seizure-free. There were four responders with convulsive seizures, one each for myoclonic seizures and drop attacks, and spasms. The responder rate was increased to 69.23% by long-term treatment of rufinamide. AEs were experienced by three patients. One patient each experienced somnolence, fatigue, and rash. Rufinamide tablets were efficacious and well tolerated in LGS patients aged 1-4 years, at doses up to 1000 mg per day, when given as add-on therapy to other antiepileptic drugs.

Pazopanib (Votrient) is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks VEGF receptors potentially serving as anti-angiogenic treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). **We report a prospective, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalating study [50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg], designed as a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate efficacy of pazopanib on HHT-related bleeding, and to measure safety**. Patients, recruited at 5 HHT Centers, required ≥ 2 Curacao criteria AND [anemia OR severe epistaxis with iron deficiency]. Co-primary outcomes, hemoglobin (Hgb) and epistaxis severity, were measured during and after treatment, and compared to baseline. Safety monitoring occurred every 1.5 weeks. Seven patients were treated with 50 mg pazopanib daily. Six/seven showed at least 50% decrease in epistaxis duration relative to baseline at some point during study; 3 showed at least 50% decrease in duration during Weeks 11 and 12. Six patients showed a decrease in ESS of > 0.71 (MID) relative to baseline at some point during study; 3/6 showed a sustained improvement. Four patients showed > 2 gm improvement in Hgb relative to baseline at one or more points during study. Health-related QOL scores improved on all SF-36 domains at Week 6 and/or Week 12, except general health (unchanged). There were 19 adverse events (AE) including one severe AE (elevated LFTs, withdrawn from dosing at 43 days); with no serious AE. In conclusion, we observed an improvement in Hgb and/or epistaxis in all treated patients. This occurred at a dose much lower than typically used for oncologic indications, with no serious AE. Further studies of pazopanib efficacy are warranted.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

30194277	Long-term Outcome of Resective Epilepsy Surgery in Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome	We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcome of resective epilepsy surgery in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We reviewed the case reports of 90 patients with LGS who had undergone resective surgery between 2003 and 2014 at the Severance Children's Hospital and managed them for a minimum period of 2 years. At the time of surgery, the patients were between 3.0 and 23.5 years old (mean ± SD: 9.3 ± 4.4). The time from seizure onset to surgery ranged from 0.7 to 20.1 years (7.2 ± 4.3). On postoperative follow-up for an average period of 6.1 ± 2.2 years (range: 2.1-11.4 years), 45 patients (50.0%) had no seizures, and 15 (16.7%) reported infrequent seizures. Seizure-free outcomes were achieved in 15 of the 21 (71.4%) hemispherectomies, 23 of the 51 (45.1%) multilobar resections, and 7 of the 18 (38.9%) single lobar resections. On high-resolution MRIs, 20 patients (22.2%) had negative findings, 8 of whom (40.0%) became seizure-free after resective surgery. Malformation of cortical development was the most common pathologic finding and was noted in 57 patients (63.3%). Seizure-free patients achieved better adaptive behavior and social competence than did patients with persistent seizures at the second (2-3 years after surgery) and third (4-6 years after surgery) follow-ups, as indicated by social quotients (P < .05). Resective surgery is a viable option in some patients to treat seizures that are associated with LGS, with a high probability of seizure control and better adaptive function.

30213680	Vagal Nerve Stimulation: Indications for Revision in Adult Refractory Epilepsy	The goal of this study was to assess the indications of revision for vagal nerve stimulation at a single institution in an adult population with drug-resistant epilepsy. This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database who underwent vagal nerve stimulator implantation for drug-resistant epilepsy during 1992-2017. Patients receiving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) implants were monitored throughout their perioperative and postoperative course and were classified according to type of seizure at the time of diagnosis and indications for VNS revision. In addition, response to dysfunctional VNS devices or adverse effects were noted. Most patients receiving VNS implants were given a diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPSs) before implantation (95.1%). Other epileptic conditions identified requiring implantation included generalized seizures, generalized-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, CPS or generalized seizures, and tuberous sclerosis (with generalized characteristics). High lead impedance was the most common indication for revision (5.6%), whereas device ineffectiveness leading to continued seizures was the most common indication for removal (2.3%). Infection, lead fracture, and dual- to single-pin lead battery changes occurred at an incidence of 1.9%, requiring either implant removal or revision. Other events that occurred, albeit rarely, included skin extrusion (0.5%), postoperative hematoma (0.5%), and implant rejection (0.5%) necessitating removal. VNS implantation in adults was shown to be a well-tolerated procedure. In addition, indications for revision or removal of the VNS device was low in this population with lead fracture rates lower than the incidence reported in pediatric population literature.

30244233	Glucose intolerance in children with cystic fibrosis: a developing country's perspective	Background Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common comorbidity reported in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). There is a dearth of data on glucose intolerance or CFRD in children with CF from developing countries. So, we planned to study the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) in children with CF and its relation with the duration and severity of CF. Methods We performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on children (2-18 years old) having CF for at least 6 months. Two-hour plasma glucose levels on OGTT were correlated with various disease-related factors. Results Out of the 25 children enrolled, there were 18 boys and seven girls. The mean age and duration of CF were 7.9±4.3 and 3.16±2.5 years, respectively. AGT was observed in 16 (64%) children with CF including three (12%) children with CFRD. Children with a duration of CF of 3 years had significantly higher prevalence (81.8%) of AGT when compared with duration ≤3 years (p-value<0.05). Twelve out of 17 (70.6%) children were colonized with Pseudomonas and 12 out of 15 (80%) children >6 years of age had AGT. There was a positive correlation of 2-h glucose value on OGTT with duration of CF and number of hospitalizations with acute pulmonary exacerbations. Conclusions The majority of children having CF for >3 years and/or age >6 years developed AGT. In our clinical setting, an annual screening with OGTT to detect AGT may be required at an early age and duration of CF.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

A systematic review	To determine whether evidence-based practice guidelines promote developmentally appropriate chronic condition self-management for children with asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis. Systematic review of clinical guidelines current as at 22 September 2017, including assessment of quality of each guideline using the iCAHE 'Guideline Quality Checklist', and mapping of the supporting evidence. Fifteen guidelines were identified: asthma (n=7) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=7), CF (n=1). Guideline quality was variable, and 11 different grading systems were used. In total, there were 28 recommendations promoting age/developmental considerations. Recommendations focused on: collaboration (n=15), chronic condition self-management education (n= 17), clinicians' skills (n= 4); personalized action plans (n=3), problem-solving (n=2); and the assessment of children's chronic condition self-management needs (n=3). Developmental transitions are highlighted as important time points in some guidelines: preschool (n=2), and adolescence (n=3). All guidelines encouraged triadic partnerships between children, adult caregivers and clinicians. Evidence supporting the developmental aspects of the guidelines' recommendations was poor; only 14 out of 57 journals listed as evidence were concordant. Current guidelines articulate that developmentally appropriate chronic condition self-management is important; however, more work needs to be done to translate the concept into practical clinical tools.	cystic fibrosis			272	Do guidelines provide evidence-based guidance to health professionals on promoting developmentally appropriate chronic condition self-management in children?

30255934	Evolution and course of early life developmental encephalopathic epilepsies: Focus on Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Developmental encephalopathic epilepsies (DEEs) are characterized by refractory seizures, disability, and early death. Opportunities to improve care and outcomes focus on West syndrome/infantile spasms (WS/IS). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is almost as common but receives little attention.** We examined initial presentations of DEEs and their evolution over time to identify risk and indicators of developing LGS.** Data are from the Connecticut Study of Epilepsy, a prospective, longitudinal study of 613 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy recruited in 1993-1997. Central review of medical records permitted classification of epilepsy syndromes at diagnosis and at reclassification 2, 5, and 9 years later. DEEs were compared to other epilepsies for seizure and cognitive outcomes and mortality. Analyses examined the evolution of DEE syndromes after initial presentation, with specific comparisons made between WS/IS and LGS. Statistical analyses were performed with t tests and chi-square tests. Fifty-eight children (9.4%) had DEEs, median onset age = 1.1 years (interquartile range ([IQR] 0.3-1.3) in DEEs and 6.0 years (IQR 3.0-9.0) in other epilepsies (P < 0.001). DEEs vs other epilepsies had more pharmacoresistance (71% vs 18%), intellectual disability (84% vs 11%), and mortality (21% vs <1%; all P < 0.001). During follow-up, the form of epilepsy evolved in 33 children. WS/IS was the most common initial diagnosis (N = 23) and in 5 children WS/IS evolved later. LGS was diagnosed initially in 4 children (1 later revised) and in 22 by the end of follow-up, including 7 evolving from WS/IS and 12 from nonsyndromic generalized, focal, or undetermined epilepsies. Evolution to LGS took a median of 1.9 years. LGS developed in 13% of infants, including 9% of those who did not present initially with WS/IS. DEEs account for disproportionate amounts of pharmacoresistance, disability, and early mortality. LGS often has a window between initial presentation and full expression. LGS should become targeted for early detection and prevention.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

30260738	Treatment with low-dose tacrolimus inhibits bleeding complications in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be found in patients suffering from a loss-of-function mutation of the gene encoding for the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 1 receptor. Interestingly, ALK-1 mutations also lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) leading to potentially life-threatening bleeding complications such as epistaxis. Current therapeutic options for both diseases are limited and often only temporary or accompanied by severe side effects. Here, we report of a patient with a mutation of the ALK-1 gene suffering from both HHT and PAH. Recently, it was shown that tacrolimus increased ALK-1 signaling and had beneficial effects in selected end-stage PAH patients. We thus hypothesized that treatment with tacrolimus may prevent disease progression in this patient. Surprisingly, treatment with low-dose tacrolimus dramatically improved his HHT-associated epistaxis but did not attenuate progression of PAH.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

30272025	Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required for RAD51-mediated maintenance of genome integrity in vascular endothelial cells	The integrity of blood vessels is fundamental to vascular homeostasis. Inactivating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2) gene cause hereditary vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, suggesting that BMPR2 and its downstream signaling pathway are pivotal to the maintenance of vascular integrity through an unknown molecular mechanism. Here we report that inactivation of BMPR2 in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells results in a deficit of RAD51, an enzyme essential for DNA repair and replication. Loss of RAD51, which causes DNA damage and cell death, is also detected in animal models and human patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Restoration of BMPR2 or activation of the BMP signaling pathway rescues RAD51 and prevents DNA damage. This is an unexpected role of BMP signaling in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and the concomitant loss of endothelial integrity and vascular remodeling associated with vascular disorders.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

30286391	Diagnosis switching and outcomes in a cohort of patients with potential epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures	There is overlap in the electroclinical features of many childhood epilepsy syndromes, especially those presenting with multiple seizure types, such as epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). This study aimed to determine the frequency of diagnosis switching and the factors influencing epilepsy syndrome diagnosis in a cohort of children with possible EMAS, as well as to explore the relationship between epilepsy syndrome diagnoses, key electroclinical features, and clinically relevant outcomes. This is a cross-sectional retrospective chart review of children treated at the Children's Hospital of Colorado with a potential diagnosis of EMAS. There were 77 patients that met eligibility criteria, including 39% (n = 30) with an initial diagnosis of EMAS and 74% (n = 57) with a final diagnosis of EMAS. On average, for the 65% of patients who received more than one epilepsy diagnosis, the first, second, and third diagnoses were received within one year, three years, and ten years after epilepsy onset, respectively. Final diagnosis was significantly related to obtaining at least a six-month period of seizure freedom, p = 0.03. Classic LGS traits, including paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike-and-wave, and tonic seizures were present in 50% of the overall cohort, although a minority of these patients had a final diagnosis of LGS. However, the presence of more LGS traits was associated with a higher likelihood of ongoing seizures. Adjusted for age of epilepsy onset, seizure freedom was half as likely for every additional LGS trait observed (0.49[0.31, 0.77], p = 0.002). Current epilepsy syndrome classification has reduced applicability due to overlapping features. This results in diagnosis switching and limited prognostic value for patients with an overlapping clinical phenotype. Future studies should attempt to stratify patients based not only on epilepsy syndrome diagnosis, but also on the presence of various electroclinical traits to more accurately predict outcome.

30309816	Evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability, and behavioral outcomes with adjunctive rufinamide in pediatric patients (≥1 to <4 years old) with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Final results from randomized study 303	Evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and behavioral effects of adjunctive rufinamide in pediatric patients (≥1 to <4 years old) with inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Study 303 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01405053) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III trial. Patients were randomized (2:1) to oral suspension rufinamide (≤45 mg/kg/day) or any other investigator-chosen antiepileptic drug (AED) for a 2-year treatment period. Primary safety/tolerability assessments included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs. Behavioral effects were assessed via the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) using the Total Problems score and change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems score. CBCL subscores were also evaluated. The Safety Analysis Set included 37 patients (rufinamide: n = 25; any other AED: n = 12). TEAE incidence was similar between the rufinamide (88.0%) and any-other-AED groups (83.3%); serious TEAE incidence was also similar between treatment groups (40.0% and 41.7%, respectively). Between treatment groups, the difference in the least squares mean CBCL Total Problems score across time was not significant (p = 0.7083), behavior outcomes were similar across all endpoints, and there were no consistent trends in CBCL subscores. Long-term (2 years) adjunctive rufinamide was well tolerated in pediatric patients with LGS. Behavioral outcomes were comparable between the rufinamide and any-other-AED groups, however the small sample size and difficulties assessing behavior in this population should be noted. The challenges of this study raise the issue of revising how studies in very young children with rare and complex epilepsies are performed.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

30357823	Pharmacokinetics of clobazam oral soluble film	Clobazam oral soluble film (COSF) is a novel dosage form under development for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The present study was undertaken to assess the pharmacokinetics of clobazam administered as single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg compared with clobazam tablets (CTAB) 20 and 10 mg in healthy adults. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of COSF 20 and 10 mg. A total of 51 adult volunteers were enrolled in a single-dose, open-label, randomized four-sequence, four-period, crossover study with treatments (A) COSF 20 mg, (B) CTAB 20 mg, (C) COSF 10 mg, and (D) CTAB 10 mg. Pharmacokinetic sampling for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam was carried out until 21 days postdose with a 28-day washout. Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the study. Visual inspections of the administration site were performed before and after COSF administration to monitor for mucosal irritation. COSF at single doses of 10 and 20 mg was bioequivalent to CTAB at equivalent doses for both clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam. The pharmacokinetics of both formulations was dose-proportional at doses of 10 and 20 mg. The number of AEs and the number of subjects experiencing AEs were dose-related across the treatment groups, with somnolence the most common event. None of these events was severe or serious, and most were mild. There was no evidence for local irritation at the administration site following COSF. COSF is a novel clobazam dosage form that is bioequivalent to CTAB. Because of its ease of administration, COSF may be expected to improve adherence, reduce likelihood of dosing error, and provide more accurate dosing than formulations of clobazam that are currently available.

The lead was completely removed and replaced by a new 303 lead on the same nerve segment. After reinitiating VNS, side effects forced us to switch it off, resulting in immediate seizure recurrence. EEG recording demonstrated a non-convulsive status epilepticus that was halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Thereafter, he remained seizure free for eight months, and regained psychomotor development.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

The conference provided a forum for professionals involved in basic science, clinical research, regulatory affairs, and clinical care to meet and discuss the latest advances related to discovery and development of drugs and devices aimed at improving the management of people with epilepsy. This progress report provides a summary of findings on investigational compounds for which data from both preclinical studies and studies in patients were presented. The compounds reviewed include anakinra, cannabidiol, cannabidivarin, fenfluramine, ganaxolone, medium-chain fatty acids, padsevonil, and the valproic derivatives valnoctamide and sec-butylpropylacetamide. On June 25, 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a standardized formulation of cannabidiol oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years and older. The report shows that there continues to be a steady flow of potential antiepileptic drugs progressing to clinical development. Many of these compounds show innovative mechanisms of action, and some have already been tested in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials, with promising efficacy and safety results.

30405366	Cannabis Therapeutics and the Future of Neurology	Neurological therapeutics have been hampered by its inability to advance beyond symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders into the realm of actual palliation, arrest or reversal of the attendant pathological processes. While cannabis-based medicines have demonstrated safety, efficacy and consistency sufficient for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges remain. This review will examine the intriguing promise that recent discoveries regarding cannabis-based medicines offer to neurological therapeutics by incorporating the neutral phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and cannabis terpenoids in the putative treatment of five syndromes, currently labeled recalcitrant to therapeutic success, and wherein improved pharmacological intervention is required: intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current basic science and clinical investigations support the safety and efficacy of such interventions in treatment of these currently intractable conditions, that in some cases share pathological processes, and the plausibility of interventions that harness endocannabinoid mechanisms, whether mediated via direct activity on CB1 and CB2 (tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, caryophyllene), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ; THCA), 5-HT1A (CBD, CBDA) or even nutritional approaches utilizing prebiotics and probiotics. The inherent polypharmaceutical properties of cannabis botanicals offer distinct advantages over the current single-target pharmaceutical model and portend to revolutionize neurological treatment into a new reality of effective interventional and even preventative treatment.

Areas covered: 1,4-disubstituted triazole ring formed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction is an important structural motif widely used to construct diverse chemotypes in chemical, biological, and material fields. 1,2,3-triazole ring containing rufinamide, an antiepileptic drug developed by Novartis, is useful in combination with other antiepileptic medicaments for the treatment of childhood-onset epilepsy known as LGS. There are numerous synthetic methods used to construct the rufinamide through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The application claims processes for the preparation of rufinamide and their intermediates. The synthetic strategy covered for the synthesis of rufinamide using activated acetylenic esters. The activation is done using N-hydroxy succinimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, 1-hydroxy benzotriazole, and 4-nitro phenol. Expert opinion: The manufacturing route appears to follow the regioselective Cu catalyzed cycloaddtion of 2,6-difluro benzyl azide with or without isolated activated acetylenic esters in three steps that provide a good lead for new synthetic strategy for the rufinamide synthesis.

Our objective was to profile and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, in HHT patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, comprised mostly of lymphocytes and monocytes, have been reported to be dysfunctional in HHT. A total of 40 clinically confirmed HHT patients and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. PBMCs were isolated from 16 mL of peripheral blood and purified for total RNA. MiRNA expression profiling was conducted with a human miRNA array analysis. Select dysregulated miRNAs and miRNA targets were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Of the 377 miRNAs screened, 41 dysregulated miRNAs were identified. Both miR-28-5p and miR-361-3p, known to target insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a potent angiogenic growth factor, were found to be significantly downregulated in HHT patients. Consequently, IGF1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly elevated. Our research successfully identified miRNA dysregulation and elevated IGF1 mRNA levels in PBMCs from HHT patients. This novel discovery represents a potential pathogenic mechanism that could be targeted to alleviate clinical manifestations of HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

30537670	The refractory epilepsy screening tool for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (REST-LGS)	The complex clinical presentation and progression of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) can complicate the accurate diagnosis of this severe, lifelong, childhood-onset epilepsy, often resulting in suboptimal treatment. The Refractory Epilepsy Screening Tool for LGS (REST-LGS) was developed to improve the identification of patients with LGS. Using the Modified Delphi Consensus, a group of experts developed and tested the REST-LGS Case Report Form (CRF) comprising 8 criteria (4 major, 4 minor) considered potentially indicative of LGS. Diagnosis-blinded specialist and nonspecialist raters at 2 epilepsy centers applied the CRF to deidentified patient records, including 1:1 records of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy or confirmed LGS. Interrater reliability was measured by Cohen's κ. Diagnosis was then unblinded to reveal common criteria for LGS or drug-resistant epilepsy. Cronbach's α was used to measure internal consistency between raters for all criteria combined. Of 200 patients, 81% to 85% met 1 to 3 major criteria. At both sites, moderate (κ, 0.41-0.60) to good (κ, 0.61-0.80) agreement on most criteria was reached between expert and nonexpert raters. Unblinding revealed that most patients with LGS met 3 major and 2 to 3 minor criteria, while patients with drug-resistant epilepsy met ≤1 major and only 1 to 2 minor criteria. Cronbach's α of raters at both sites was 0.64. The combined number of major/minor criteria on the CRF may be particularly indicative of LGS. Therefore, the REST-LGS may be a valuable clinical tool in identifying patients requiring further diagnostic evaluation for LGS.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

30554497	Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in Mitochondrial Disease	Previous studies have shown that neurologic symptoms are dominant in patients with mitochondrial diseases, and most of these patients have seizure-related disorders. The epileptic classification of these patients as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is as high as 25%. This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations, diagnoses, treatments, and epilepsy in LGS, which is associated with mitochondrial disease. A retrospective study was conducted on 372 patients who were diagnosed with mitochondrial disease between 2006 and 2016. Of these 372 patients, 40 patients diagnosed with LGS were selected, and they were classified into two groups based on the history of West syndrome. Patient characteristics were reviewed, and associations between clinical factors and outcomes after the treatment were analyzed. The proportion of individuals with mitochondrial disease with LGS with a history of West syndrome was 32.5%. Among the patients with mitochondrial disease with LGS, neonatal seizure (p=0.029), seizure as the first symptom (p=0.018), and generalized paroxysmal fast activity frequency on electroencephalogram (p=0.018) in the group with a history of West syndrome were statistically significantly high. The first symptom onset (0.6±0.4 yrs vs. 1.6±0.9 yrs, p=0.003) and first seizure onset (0.9±0.7 yrs vs. 3.9±3.1 yrs, p<0.001) were significantly faster in patients with a history of West syndrome. Close monitoring of the medical condition and early intervention might improve the prognosis of individuals with mitochondrial disease with LGS and a history of West syndrome.

30564493	Late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Diagnostic evaluation and outcome	We describe the clinical features and outcome in patients with late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Adult patients evaluated between January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2017, who presented with onset of LGS ≥10 years were identified. Data abstracted included age at seizure onset, seizure types, etiology, treatments, EEG and neuroimaging results, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and autoimmune evaluation. Ten patients (8 females) were identified. The mean age at onset of seizures consistent with LGS was 16.5 years (range, 10-32 years). Seizure types included tonic, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures (all), myoclonic seizures (n = 3), and atypical absence seizures (n = 7). Five patients had normal intellectual function at onset. Prolonged video-EEG monitoring recorded seizures and generalized interictal epileptiform discharges in all. All patients had drug-resistant epilepsy (range of antiseizure drugs tried, 7-16). Two patients had a history of intrathecal methotrexate to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two patients had malformations of cortical development. CSF analysis (n = 5) showed a mild elevation in the protein level without other abnormalities. Autoantibody determinations in the serum (n = 4) or the CSF (n = 5) and genetic testing (n = 5) were negative. At final follow-up, all but 1 patient was disabled and required a caregiver, and none were driving. One patient died of probable sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Late-onset LGS represents a rare, treatment-resistant generalized epilepsy that is disabling and may be associated with progressive cognitive impairment. The elevated CSF protein level in our cohort could have been due to high seizure burden but increases the possibility of an inflammatory component to the pathophysiology of this disorder.

30596371	Orthotopic Liver Transplantation for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and MEN Type I Syndrome - Case Report and Review of Literature	Introduction: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) mainly affecting the lungs and the liver. In this case AVM's resulted in liver cirrhosis and an indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).   Case Report: A 59 year-old male patient with HHT who had been previously diagnosed with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 Syndrome (MEN 1) was listed for OLT for end-stage liver disease due to hepatic AVMs. During the procedure, a novel type of arterial anastomosis (end-toside) was chosen because of the mismatch in diameter between the hepatic artery (HA) of the donor and the recipient, respectively. Graft function was normal and repeat Doppler ultrasound studies showed a normally functioning arterial anastomosis. However, the patient died on POD 34 due to an un-related cause (cardiac arrest resulting from myocardial infarction). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an association of HHT and MEN 1. Moreover, this is also the first reported end-to-side arterial anastomosis in an HHT patient during OLT. Our paper shows that the surgical technique we applied is both feasible and safe.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

30616356	Cannabidiol: A New Hope for Patients With Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes	To review the efficacy, safety, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of pure, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD; Epidiolex) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Relevant information was identified through EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2018). Product labeling and https://www.clinicaltrials.gov were also reviewed. English language articles evaluating efficacy and safety in humans with treatment-resistant epilepsies were reviewed; additional pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies in humans, animals, and in vitro were also included. Pure, plant-based CBD is a pharmaceutical grade extract that exhibits clinically significant antiseizure properties, with a hypothesized multimodal mechanism of action. In the GWPCARE trial series, CBD displayed superior efficacy in reducing key seizure frequencies (convulsive seizures in DS; drop seizures in LGS) by 17% to 23% compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to standard antiepileptic drugs in patients 2 years of age and older. Common adverse effects were somnolence, diarrhea, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Noteworthy drug-drug interactions included clobazam, valproates, and significant inducers/inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 enzymes. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: A discussion regarding CBD dosing, administration, adverse effects, monitoring parameters, and interactions is provided to guide clinicians. CBD offers patients with DS and LGS a new treatment option for refractory seizures. This is the first cannabis-derived medication with approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. This CBD formulation significantly reduces seizures as an adjunct to standard antiepileptic therapies in patients ≥2 years old with DS and LGS and is well tolerated.

30673834	Factors affecting epilepsy prognosis in patients with tuberous sclerosis	We aimed to determine the characteristics of epileptic seizures that significantly affect the cognitive functions of 83 patients followed with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), their resistance to treatment and risk factors causing this resistance. In order to determine the prognosis, the seizure-free/seizure-controlled group and the group with refractory seizures were compared. In addition, risk factors affecting cognitive functions in the patients were determined. There was a statistical significance between the presence of a history of seizures in the neonatal period, the age of onset of seizures being less than 2 years of age, autism, status epilepticus, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), presence of infantile spasm, generalization of the electroencephalography (EEG) findings, the number of tubers in cerebral imaging being more than three and refractory seizures (p < 0.05). Statistically significant relationship was found between presence of a history of seizures in the neonatal period, the age of onset of seizures, autism, LGS, presence of infantile spasm, presence of status epilepticus history, history of using more than three antiepileptic drugs, generalization of EEG findings, presence of SEGA in cerebral imaging, number of tubers being more than three and the patient's mental retardation (p < 0.05). In logistic regression analysis, the age of the seizure onset being less than 2 years of age, the presence of autism and number of tubers being more than three in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are determined to be the risk factors that most likely to increase the seizures to be more resistant.

30704695	Hospitalizations with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary hypertension in the United States from 2000 to 2014	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes widespread abnormal vasculature development, resulting in multiple complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the potential severity of PH, there is a lack of data on hospitalization characteristics and outcomes in the HHT-PH population. The purpose of this analysis was to describe trends and outcomes of HHT-PH hospitalizations within the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS). Adult hospitalizations (age ≥18 years) with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HHT were identified from the 2000-2014 NIS. Records were stratified by a concurrent PH diagnosis. Trends, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalizations with HHT and PH were analyzed. There were 55,189 adult hospitalizations with HHT from 2000 to 2014, of which 4602 (8.3%) had a concurrent diagnosis of PH. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose steadily from 165 (5.1%) in 2000 to 540 (13.8%) in 2014 (p < 0.001). They were more common in females (vs. HHT without PH, 71.6% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001) and were associated with a higher comorbidity burden (total 4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in HHT-PH hospitalizations than in HHT without PH (3.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression, the diagnosis of PH remained significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.63, p = 0.015) in HHT hospitalizations. HHT-PH hospitalizations rose from 2000 to 2014. Notably, HHT patients with a concurrent PH diagnosis were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

30717761	Safety of thalidomide and bevacizumab in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystemic inherited vascular dysplasia that leads to nosebleeds and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Anti-angiogenic drugs thalidomide and bevacizumab have been increasingly used off-label with variable results. The HHT working group within the ERN for Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN), developed a questionnaire-based retrospective capture of adverse events (AEs) classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Sixty-nine HHT patients received bevacizumab, 37 (50.6%) for high output cardiac failure/hepatic AVMs, and 32 (49.4%) for bleeding; the 69 patients received bevacizumab for a mean of 11 months for a total of 63.8 person/years treatment. 67 received thalidomide, all for epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding; they received thalidomide for a mean of 13.4 months/patient for a total of 75 person/years treatment. AEs were reported in 58 patients, 33 with bevacizumab, 37 with thalidomide. 32 grade 1-3 AEs related to bevacizumab were reported with an average incidence rate of 50 per 100 person-years. 34 grade 1-3 AEs related to thalidomide were reported with an average incidence rate of 45.3 per 100 person-years. Bevacizumab AEs were more common in females (27 AEs in 46 women) than males (6 in 23, p < 0.001).

30740695	Cannabidiol in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Interim analysis of an open-label extension study	Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who completed 1 of 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) (GWPCARE3, NCT02224560 or GWPCARE4, NCT02224690) were invited to enroll in an open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of CBD (GWPCARE5, NCT02224573). Herein we present an interim analysis of the safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes from this trial. Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD oral solution (Epidiolex; 100 mg/mL), titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg/d over a 2-week titration period, in addition to their existing medications. Doses could be reduced if not tolerated or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d if thought to be of benefit. This interim analysis was based on a November 2016 data cut. Of 368 patients who completed treatment in GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4, 366 (99.5%) enrolled in the OLE study (GWPCARE5). Median treatment duration was 38 weeks at a mean modal dose of 23 mg/kg/d. Most patients (92.1%) experienced adverse events (AEs), primarily of mild (32.5%) or moderate (43.4%) severity. The most common AEs were diarrhea (26.8%), somnolence (23.5%), and convulsion (21.3%). Thirty-five patients (9.6%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Liver transaminase elevations were reported in 37 patients (10.1%), of whom 29 were receiving concomitant valproic acid; 34 cases resolved spontaneously or with dose modification of CBD or concomitant medication. Median reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency (quantified monthly over 12-week periods) ranged from 48% to 60% through week 48. Median reduction in monthly total seizure frequency ranged from 48% to 57% across all 12-week periods through week 48. Eighty-eight percent of patients/caregivers reported an improvement in the patient's overall condition per the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale. In this study, long-term add-on CBD treatment had an acceptable safety profile in patients with LGS and led to sustained reductions in seizures.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

30744395	Angiopoietin-2 Inhibition Rescues Arteriovenous Malformation in a Smad4 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Mouse Model	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in 4 transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway members, including the central transcriptional mediator of the TGFβ pathway, Smad4. Loss of Smad4 causes the formation of inappropriate, fragile connections between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can hemorrhage leading to stroke, aneurysm, or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and the TGFβ downstream effectors responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated AVM formation are currently unknown. To identify potential biological targets of the TGFβ pathway involved in AVM formation, we performed RNA- and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing experiments on BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9)-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and isolated ECs from a Smad4-inducible, EC-specific knockout ( Smad4-iECKO) mouse model that develops retinal AVMs. These sequencing studies identified the angiopoietin-Tek signaling pathway as a downstream target of SMAD4. We used monoclonal blocking antibodies to target a specific component in this pathway and assess its effects on AVM development. Sequencing studies uncovered 212 potential biological targets involved in AVM formation, including the EC surface receptor, TEK (TEK receptor tyrosine kinase) and its antagonistic ligand, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2). In Smad4-iECKO mice, Angpt2 expression is robustly increased, whereas Tek levels are decreased, resulting in an overall reduction in angiopoietin-Tek signaling. We provide evidence that SMAD4 directly represses Angpt2 transcription in ECs. Inhibition of ANGPT2 function in Smad4-deficient mice, either before or after AVMs form, prevents and alleviates AVM formation and normalizes vessel diameters. These rescue effects are attributed to a reversion in EC morphological changes, such as cell size and shape that are altered in the absence of Smad4. Our studies provide a novel mechanism whereby the loss of Smad4 causes increased Angpt2 transcription in ECs leading to AVM formation, increased blood vessel calibers, and changes in EC morphology in the retina. Blockade of ANGPT2 function in an in vivo Smad4 model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia alleviated these vascular phenotypes, further implicating ANGPT2 as an important TGFβ downstream mediator of AVM formation. Therefore, alternative approaches that target ANGPT2 function may have therapeutic value for the alleviation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms, such as AVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

We present a case of Lennox Gastaut syndrome in which forced normalization developed after vagus nerve stimulation was stopped. The patient had drug resistant epilepsy and failed anti-seizure drugs, vagus nerve stimulation, and a partial callosotomy. The patient had multiple types of seizures including drop attacks, absences, and tonic-clonic seizures. He tried vagus nerve stimulation for two years without success. Forced normalization developed after the vagus nerve stimulator was turned off. This is the first case to our knowledge to describe forced normalization after turning off the vagus nerve stimulator.

30831398	How often is antiseizure drug-free ketogenic diet therapy achieved?	The ketogenic diet (KD) is often started not only for seizure reduction but also to potentially wean antiseizure drugs (ASDs) in children with epilepsy. Although there have been several publications regarding ASD reduction on the KD, it is unknown how often complete medication withdrawal occurs. **We reviewed the charts of all children started on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital from 1/11 to 4/18. **Children were defined as achieving drug-free diet (DFD) status if they started the KD on at least 1 ASD and achieved a period of time where they were on the KD alone. Over the time period, 232 children were evaluated; DFD status occurred in 43 (18.5%), of which 32 (13.8% of the full cohort) remained off ASDs for the remainder of their KD treatment course. Eleven children restarted ASD after a mean of 7 months. Children achieving DFD therapy were more likely to be younger, have fewer ASDs at KD onset, have Glut1 deficiency or epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, but were less likely to have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or a gastrostomy tube.

30831405	The direct cost of seizure events in severe childhood-onset epilepsies: A retrospective claims-based analysis	The objective of the study was to assess the direct cost of medically treated seizure events in severe childhood-onset epilepsies. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representative conditions associated with frequent intractable seizures. Commercial and Medicaid insurance claims from 2010 to 2015 were queried to identify patients with possible LGS, possible DS, or TSC, having ≥2 years of continuous insurance from the date of first epilepsy/seizure diagnosis or antiepileptic drug (AED) fill (index date). Utilization and cost data in patients with and without seizure events requiring acute treatment were evaluated for two years postindex. Medically treated seizure events resulting in minor, moderate, severe, and no injury were included. Average costs were normalized to 2017 dollars at 3% per annum and reported for each cohort, by insurance type and degree of injury. Among 9754 patients, 55.4-58.8% of LGS, 47.7-55.8% of DS, and 13.7-28.0% of TSC cohorts had ≥1 medically treated seizure event, depending on insurance type. Events during two-year postindex averaged 2.8-3.3 in LGS, 3.1-3.3 in DS, and 1.9-2.2 in TSC; cost per event averaged $8147-$14,759 in LGS, $4637-$8751 in DS, and $5335-$9672 in TSC. In patients with events, average all-cause costs per-patient-per-year (PPPY) were $71,512-$84,939 in LGS; $31,278-$43,758 in DS; and $42,997-$48,330 in TSC. Patients with intractable seizures having at least one medically treated seizure event incur substantial all-cause costs. Our results can be used to inform cost effectiveness and budget impact models to estimate the value of existing and future treatments for these and similar conditions.

However, confirmatory testing of presumptive screen-positive cases is required using high efficiency separations for improved specificity in order to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for certain classes of IEMs. **Here, we describe recent advances using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for reliable second-tier screening or confirmatory testing based on targeted analysis of amino acids, acylcarnitines, nucleosides, and other classes of polar metabolites associated with IEMs.** Additionally, nontargeted metabolite profiling enables the identification of unknown biomarkers of clinical significance for other genetic diseases that are currently screened by bioassays and/or mutation panels, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Noteworthy, CE-MS allows for resolution of isobaric/isomeric interferences without complicated sample handling that is ideal when analyzing volume-restricted biospecimens from neonates/infants, including dried blood spots and sweat specimens. New developments to improve concentration sensitivity, as well as enhance sample throughput and quality control for unambiguous confirmatory testing of IEMs will also be discussed when using multiplexed separations based on multisegment injection-CE-MS.	cystic fibrosis			244	New Advances for Newborn Screening of Inborn Errors of Metabolism by Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS).

Individuals experience recurrent respiratory infections, increased work of breathing, cough and musculoskeletal changes with pain. Previous research found that massage therapy (MT) decreased pain, muscle tightness, and anxiety in individuals with CF, but did not use valid/reliable measurements of quality of life (QOL). To evaluate the effects of MT on QOL and clinical outcomes in individuals 8 to 21 years old with CF. A 622-bed nonprofit pediatric hospital in Ohio in the United States. Convenience sample of 24 patients with CF; 12 randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, respectively. Prospective two-group controlled pre/post pilot study using deep tissue myofascial trigger point massage over 10 to 12 weeks. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL 4.0); Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R); numeric rating scales (NRS) for pain, muscle tightness, ease of breathing, relaxation; pulmonary function (PFT); single breath count; thoracic excursion (TE). All participants were Caucasian; mean age 15.7 (SD = 3.5) years; 16 (66.6%) female. No significant differences were found in terms of age, gender, baseline pain between MT and control groups. At the final visit, compared to the control group, the children in MT group showed statistically significantly reduced muscle tightness (p = .048) with a large effect size (ω2 =0.163) and marginally statistically significantly higher levels of relaxation (p = .052), less pain (p = .076), and improved upper TE (p = .078) and lower TE (p = .056) scores with large and moderate effect sizes (ω2 = 0.156, ω2 = 0.095, ω2 = 0.083, and ω2 = 0.073).

30888464	Abdominal manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a series of 333 patients over 15 years	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder that commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and the liver resulting in telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Previous studies looking at the prevalence of liver and abdominal organ involvement in HHT have been limited by differing imaging techniques and sample size limitations. We sought to define the prevalence of HHT related abdominal vascular abnormalities using optimized multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) exams in a large cohort of HHT patients. Between January 2001 and May 2015; we identified a total of 333 consecutive HHT patients who had undergone a dedicated HHT protocol multiphase abdominal CT at our institution. The CT exams were reviewed by three board certified abdominal radiologists for the presence of vascular abnormalities involving the liver, pancreas, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Vascular abnormalities involving the liver were further categorized as telangiectasias, large confluent vascular masses, perfusion abnormalities, or hepatic shunts. In patients with abdominal vascular abnormalities, the liver was the most commonly involved organ, with 180 out of 333 (54.1%) patients demonstrating at least one hepatic vascular abnormality (telangiectasia, confluent vascular mass, transient perfusion abnormalities, and hepatic shunts), with most (70.0%) demonstrating multiple hepatic vascular abnormalities. The other most common organs involved included the pancreas (18.0%), spleen (6.3%), and small bowel (4.5%). In patients with the clinical diagnosis of HHT, greater than half demonstrate an abdominal vascular abnormality, with the most commonly involved organ being the liver. These may be under recognized on routine or single phase contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. This supports the use of optimized multiphasic abdominal CT exams as an important tool for the evaluation and screening of patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

30955420	Don't Fear the Reefer-Evidence Mounts for Plant-Based Cannabidiol as Treatment for Epilepsy	Effect of Cannabidiol on Drop Seizures in the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Devinsky O, Patel AD, Cross JH, et al; GWPCARE3 Study Group. N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1888-1897. Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2-55 years) who had had 2 or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg/kg (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in 2 equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period. A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group ( P = .005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group, and P = .002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. Among children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560.) Long-Term Safety and Treatment Effects of Cannabidiol in Children and Adults With Treatment-Resistant Epilepsies: Expanded Access Program Results Szaflarski JP, Bebin EM, Comi AM, et al; CBD EAP Study Group. Epilepsia. 2018;59(8):1540-1548. Since 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded access program (EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP patients treated through December 2016. Twenty-five US-based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2 to 10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2 to 4 weeks through 16 weeks and every 2 to 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy end points included the percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency and percentage of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in seizures versus baseline. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for missing data. Adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit. Of 607 patients in the safety data set, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most common reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was 13 years (range, 0.4-62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0-10). Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add-on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by 48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%). Results from this ongoing EAP support previous observational and clinical trial data, showing that add-on CBD may be an efficacious long-term treatment option for TRE. Randomized, Dose-Ranging Safety Trial of Cannabidiol in Dravet Syndrome Devinsky O, Patel AD, Thiele EA, et al; GWPCARE1 Part A Study Group. Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1204-e1211. To evaluate the safety and preliminary pharmacokinetics of a pharmaceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol (CBD) in children with Dravet syndrome. Patients aged 4 to 10 years were randomized 4:1 to CBD (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d) or placebo taken twice daily. The double-blind trial comprised 4-week baseline, 3-week treatment (including titration), 10-day taper, and 4-week follow-up periods. Completers could continue in an open-label extension. Multiple pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken on the first day of dosing and at end of treatment for measurement of CBD, its metabolites 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; clobazam and metabolite N-desmethylclobazam [N-CLB], valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol). Safety assessments were clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse events (AEs), seizure frequency, and suicidality. Thirty-four patients were randomized (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups and 7 to placebo); 32 (94%) completed treatment. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites was dose proportional (AUC0-t). Cannabidiol did not affect concomitant AED levels, apart from an increase in N-CLB (except in patients taking stiripentol). The most common AEs on CBD were pyrexia, somnolence, decreased appetite, sedation, vomiting, ataxia, and abnormal behavior. Six patients taking CBD and valproate developed elevated transaminases; none met criteria for drug-induced liver injury and all recovered. No other clinically relevant safety signals were observed. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites increased proportionally with dose. An interaction with N-CLB was observed, likely related to CBD inhibition of cytochrome P450 subtype 2C19. Cannabidiol resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated. This study provides class I evidence that for children with Dravet syndrome, CBD resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	3.4.

Electrocorticography is a useful tool to guide the localization of the epileptogenic focus for surgical resection in epilepsy surgery. Drug interactions, proconvulsant or anticonvulsant activity of the anesthetics, and anesthetic influence on intraoperative electrocorticography are the primary concerns to be addressed in these patients. We observed that dexmedetomidine-based anesthesia facilitates intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring. Dexmedetomidine, by decreasing the requirements of other anesthetic agents, offers better recovery profile and pain relief with minimal respiratory depression in patients undergoing disconnective epilepsy surgeries.

31027440	Impact of Intermediate Cystic Fibrosis Classification on Parents' Perceptions of Child Vulnerability and Protectiveness	This cross-sectional, mixed-method study examined factors associated with parent perceptions of child vulnerability and protectiveness in three groups: cystic fibrosis (CF-group, n = 40), intermediate CF classification (I-group, n = 20), and healthy (H-group, n = 50). A composite indicator structural equation (CISE) using Bayesian estimation tested two mediational models: psychological and biological. Significant results ( p < .05) from the psychological model showed I-group and CF-group parents perceived their children to be more vulnerable than H-group parents but reported lower levels of protectiveness than H-group parents. Perceptions of vulnerability mediated protectiveness for CF- and I-groups. The biological model showed I-group children had significantly less severe genotype and phenotype, and lower sweat chloride levels than the CF-group; I-group parents had lower expectations about children developing CF symptoms. Both models showed negative associations between children's ages and protectiveness. Psychological factors explained perceptions of child vulnerability and protectiveness; biological factors explained protectiveness. Parent perceptions of vulnerability and protectiveness are separate, independent constructs.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

31087253	Focus on echocardiographic right ventricular strain analysis in cystic fibrosis adults without cardiovascular risk factors: a case-control study	Strain echocardiography is able to detect subclinical ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Prolonged survival to cystic fibrosis favors heart and vessel involvement. The purpose of the present study was to compare clinically stable adult patients affected by cystic fibrosis without overt pulmonary hypertension with controls to evaluate right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic function by means of strain and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), respectively. 22 adults affected by cystic fibrosis and 24 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex were enrolled. None had known cardiovascular risk factors or overt pulmonary hypertension. All people underwent blood pressure measurement and transthoracic echocardiography. Cystic fibrosis patients showed higher sPAP [median 25 (IQR 21-30) vs 22 (22-22) mmHg; p = 0.02] and more frequent RV diastolic dysfunction (p < 0.001). Among cases, some RV systolic parameters were significantly altered than controls, such as TAPSE [20 (18-24) vs. 23 (21-28) mm; p = 0.001], FAC [34 (26-44) vs. 49 (48-50)%; p < 0.001], midwall tissue strain [- 25.0 (- 31.3 to - 22.8) vs. - 30.5 (- 31.8 to - 29.3)%; p = 0.03], apical tissue strain [- 22 (- 29.3 to - 19.0) vs. - 30.5 (- 32.8 to - 28.3)%; p = 0.001] and 2D strain [- 22.0 (- 25.1 to - 19.0) vs. - 29.5 (- 31.8 to - 27.3)%; p < 0.001]. Finally, 2D strain correlated with spirometric FEV1 (ρ = - 0.463, p = 0.03) and nearly with FEF25-75% (ρ = - 0.393, p = 0.07). Our study confirmed a RV subclinical systo-diastolic dysfunction in clinically stable patients affected by cystic fibrosis without overt pulmonary hypertension nor cardiovascular risk factors. This may be due to systemic inflammation and temporary recurrent pulmonary hypertension. We retain that RV 2D strain and TDI echocardiography could become an important tool in the follow-up of these patients.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

31161980	Cannabidiol Adverse Effects and Toxicity	Currently, there is a great interest in the potential medical use of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabinoid. Productive pharmacological research on CBD occurred in the 1970s and intensified recently with many discoveries about the endocannabinoid system. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies led to FDA-approval of Epidiolex®, a purified CBD medicine formulated for oral administration for the treatment of infantile refractory epileptic syndromes, by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018. The World Health Organization considers rescheduling cannabis and cannabinoids. CBD use around the world is expanding for diseases that lack scientific evidence of the drug's efficacy. Preclinical and clinical studies also report adverse effects (AEs) and toxicity following CBD intake. Relevant studies reporting CBD's AEs or toxicity were identified from PubMed, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE through January 2019. Studies defining CBD's beneficial effects were included to provide balance in estimating risk/benefit. CBD is not risk-free. In animals, CBD AEs included developmental toxicity, embryo-fetal mortality, central nervous system inhibition and neurotoxicity, hepatocellular injuries, spermatogenesis reduction, organ weight alterations, male reproductive system alterations, and hypotension, although at doses higher than recommended for human pharmacotherapies. Human CBD studies for epilepsy and psychiatric disorders reported CBD-induced drug-drug interactions, hepatic abnormalities, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and somnolence. CBD has proven therapeutic efficacy for serious conditions such as Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and is likely to be recommended off label by physicians for other conditions. However, AEs and potential drug-drug interactions must be taken into consideration by clinicians prior to recommending off-label CBD.

31168494	Novel seizure outcomes in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Post hoc analysis of seizure-free days in rufinamide Study 303	Drug development for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is based on clinical trials that use drop seizure counts. However, such counts do not assess total seizure burden and affect a patient's quality of life (QoL). **In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated two novel seizure efficacy parameters related to QoL in pediatric patients with LGS, using seizure diary data from rufinamide Study 303 (NCT01405053)**. Study 303 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study involving patients aged ≥1 to <4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive add-on therapy with rufinamide or any other approved antiseizure drug (ASD), in addition to their existing treatment of 1-3 ASDs, across a 106-week treatment phase. Seizure diaries, completed by parents or caregivers, recorded seizure occurrence, and were used in this post hoc analysis to evaluate two novel efficacy parameters comparing baseline vs postbaseline mean number of seizure-free days and assessing time to reach the number of prerandomization seizures for patients receiving rufinamide or any other ASD. Patients received rufinamide (n = 25) or any other ASD (n = 12). For rufinamide, mean number of seizure-free days was 42.2% greater postbaseline compared with baseline (P < 0.0001); only one rufinamide patient experienced a decrease in number of seizure-free days postbaseline. Median time to reach the baseline number of seizures increased by 10.5 days for rufinamide and 0.5 days for the any-other-ASD group during the treatment phase, to 46.0 and 54.0 days, respectively. Both of these novel and contrasting endpoints demonstrated potential improvements in seizure outcomes in patients receiving rufinamide postbaseline vs baseline. Although these parameters should be investigated in larger patient populations, our initial findings suggest that they could be applied as predefined primary endpoints for seizure assessment in future clinical trials for LGS drug development.

Drug development for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is based on clinical trials that use drop seizure counts. However, such counts do not assess total seizure burden and affect a patient's quality of life (QoL). **In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated two novel seizure efficacy parameters related to QoL in pediatric patients with LGS, using seizure diary data from rufinamide Study 303 (NCT01405053)**. Study 303 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study involving patients aged ≥1 to <4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive add-on therapy with rufinamide or any other approved antiseizure drug (ASD), in addition to their existing treatment of 1-3 ASDs, across a 106-week treatment phase. Seizure diaries, completed by parents or caregivers, recorded seizure occurrence, and were used in this post hoc analysis to evaluate two novel efficacy parameters comparing baseline vs postbaseline mean number of seizure-free days and assessing time to reach the number of prerandomization seizures for patients receiving rufinamide or any other ASD. Patients received rufinamide (n = 25) or any other ASD (n = 12). For rufinamide, mean number of seizure-free days was 42.2% greater postbaseline compared with baseline (P < 0.0001); only one rufinamide patient experienced a decrease in number of seizure-free days postbaseline. Median time to reach the baseline number of seizures increased by 10.5 days for rufinamide and 0.5 days for the any-other-ASD group during the treatment phase, to 46.0 and 54.0 days, respectively. Both of these novel and contrasting endpoints demonstrated potential improvements in seizure outcomes in patients receiving rufinamide postbaseline vs baseline. Although these parameters should be investigated in larger patient populations, our initial findings suggest that they could be applied as predefined primary endpoints for seizure assessment in future clinical trials for LGS drug development.
31176687	A missense mutation in SLC6A1 associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome impairs GABA transporter 1 protein trafficking and function	Mutations in SLC6A1 have been associated mainly with myoclonic atonic epilepsy (MAE) and intellectual disability. We identified a novel missense mutation in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) characterized by severe seizures and developmental delay. Exome Sequencing was performed in an epilepsy patient cohort. The impact of the mutation was evaluated by 3H γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake, structural modeling, live cell microscopy, cell surface biotinylation and a high-throughput assay flow cytometry in both neurons and non neuronal cells. We discovered a heterozygous missense mutation (c700G to A [pG234S) in the SLC6A1 encoding GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). Structural modeling suggests the mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation. With transient expression of enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) tagged rat GAT-1 cDNAs, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) transporter had reduced total protein expression in both rat cortical neurons and HEK 293 T cells. With a high-throughput flow cytometry assay and live cell surface biotinylation, we demonstrated that the mutant GAT-1(G234S) had reduced cell surface expression. 3H radioactive labeling GABA uptake assay in HeLa cells indicated a reduced function of the mutant GAT-1(G234S). This mutation caused instability of the mutant transporter protein, which resulted in reduced cell surface and total protein levels. The mutation also caused reduced GABA uptake in addition to reduced protein expression, leading to reduced GABA clearance, and altered GABAergic signaling in the brain. The impaired trafficking and reduced GABA uptake function may explain the epilepsy phenotype in the patient.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

31178266	Study of a Cohort of Patients With Cystic Fibrosis and Isolation of Scedosporium spp	In recent years an increase in the prevalence of colonization and infection by Scedosporium spp. in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been observed. In this article,** we study the frequency of isolation of Scedosporium spp. in an adult CF Unit, analyzing characteristics of the patients and predisposing factors. **A retrospective observational study was conducted in 87 adult CF patients in whom the presence of positive culture for Scedosporium spp. was tested for a 5-year period (January 2012-July 2017). We recorded the following clinical variables: age, sex, body mass index, genotype, presence of pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial colonization, lung function, other complications, exacerbations and treatment, and the modified Bhalla score from the last high-resolution computed tomography. Results were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics Version 22.0 software. Scedosporium spp. was isolated in 25.3% of patients. In the bivariate analysis, these patients showed a higher rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, worse score in the Bhalla classification (highlighting the following items: bronchiectasis, mucus plugs and bronchial generations), a slight decrease in the lung diffusion capacity and more frequently received inhaled antibiotics. In the logistic regression multivariate analysis, only the bronchial generations item was significant. Scedosporium spp. must be considered an emerging opportunistic pathogen in patients with CF whose clinical involvement, risk factors or need for treatment is unknown.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

31190668	In trans variant calling reveals enrichment for compound heterozygous variants in genes involved in neuronal development and growth	Compound heterozygotes occur when different variants at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here **we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of variants at the individual level.** We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 Genomes Project participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or infantile spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 Genomes Project data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 Genomes Project participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous variants in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development - PRTG (p = 0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p = 0.022, 1% MAF, combined ancestries) and MACF1 (p = 0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due to the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous variants should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.

31214142	Catabolism of Nucleic Acids by a Cystic Fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa  Isolate: An Adaptive Pathway to Cystic Fibrosis Sputum Environment	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We undertook Biolog Phenotype Microarray testing of P. aeruginosa CF isolates to investigate their catabolic capabilities compared to P. aeruginosa laboratory strains PAO1 and PA14. One strain, PASS4, displayed an unusual phenotype, only showing strong respiration on adenosine and inosine. Further testing indicated that PASS4 could grow on DNA as a sole carbon source, with a higher biomass production than PAO1. This suggested that PASS4 was specifically adapted to metabolize extracellular DNA, a substrate present at high concentrations in the CF lung. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of PASS4 and PAO1 when grown with DNA as a sole carbon source identified a set of upregulated genes, including virulence and host-adaptation genes. PASS4 was unable to utilize N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine, and when we selected PASS4 mutants able to grow on this carbon source, they also displayed a gain in ability to catabolize a broad range of other carbon sources. Genome sequencing of the mutants revealed they all contained mutations within the purK gene, encoding a key protein in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This suggested that PASS4 was a purine auxotroph. Growth assays in the presence of 2 mM adenosine and the complementation of PASS4 with an intact purK gene confirmed this conclusion. Purine auxotrophy may represent a viable microbial strategy for adaptation to DNA-rich environments such as the CF lung.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

31215313	Safety and Efficacy of Supratherapeutic Doses of Clobazam	Clobazam is a commonly used long-acting benzodiazepine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome. The FDA approved maximum dosage of clobazam is 1 mg/kg/d or a total of 40 mg a day. Many providers exceed this dosage but there is limited data on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of supratherapeutic doses. We reviewed retrospective data at our institution and compared patients on supratherapeutic doses to patients on therapeutic doses. A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria (65 supratherapeutic, 67 therapeutic). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of seizure control, health care utilization, or side effects between patients on supratherapeutic doses and those on therapeutic doses. This study lends further support to the safety and tolerability of supratherapuetic doses of clobazam.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

31243019	Different functional roles for K+  channel subtypes in regulating small intestinal glucose and ion transport	Although K+ channels are important in mediating the driving force for colonic ion transport, their role in small intestinal transport is poorly understood. To investigate this, small intestinal short circuit currents (Isc ) and HCO3- secretion were measured in mice, and intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in small intestinal epithelial SCBN cells. The expression and location of Kv subtypes were verified by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Diabetic mice were also used to investigate the role of Kv subtypes in regulating intestinal glucose absorption. We found that KV7.1 is not involved in duodenal ion transport, while KCa3.1 selectively regulates duodenal Isc and HCO3- secretion in a Ca2+-mediated but not cAMP-mediated manner. Blockade of KCa3.1 increased the rate of HCO3- fluxes via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels in SCBN cells. Jejunal Isc was significantly stimulated by glucose, but markedly inhibited by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA). Moreover, both Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 were expressed in jejunal mucosae. Finally, 4-AP significantly attenuated weight gain of normal and diabetic mice, and both 4-AP and TEA significantly lowered blood glucose of diabetic mice. This study not only examines the contribution of various K+ channel subtypes to small intestinal epithelial ion transport and glucose absorption, but also proposes a novel concept for developing specific K+ channel blockers to reduce weight gain and lower blood glucose in diabetes mellitus.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

However, it is reasonable to consider non-medical treatments, such as surgery, after failure of two-to-three drugs. This review has as goal to describe systematically the different therapeutic options for LGS, including, not only recognized antiepileptic drugs, but also new oral drugs, immune therapy, diet, surgery, and neurostimulation techniques.

31294114	Caffeine boosts Ataluren's readthrough activity	The readthrough of nonsense mutations by small molecules like Ataluren is considered a novel therapeutic approach to overcome the gene defect in several genetic diseases as cystic fibrosis (CF). This pharmacological approach suppresses translation termination at premature termination codons (PTCs readthrough) thus restoring the expression of a functional protein. However, readthrough might be limited by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cell process that reduces the amount/level of PTCs containing mRNAs. Here we investigate the combined action of Ataluren and caffeine to enhance the readthrough of PTCs. IB3.1 CF cells with a nonsense mutation were treated with caffeine to attenuate the Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) activity and thus enhance the stability of the nonsense (ns)-CFTR-mRNA to be targeted by Ataluren. Our results show that NMD attenuation by caffeine enhances mRNA stability and more importantly when combined with Ataluren increase the recovery of the full-length CFTR protein.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Absence epilepsies are the prototypes of IGEs. In childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies, by definition, all patients manifest absence seizures associated with an EEG pattern of generalized spike-wave (GSW) discharges. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, myoclonic jerks, usually affecting shoulders and arms bilaterally and appearing upon awakening, are the most characteristic clinical feature. Myoclonic jerks are accompanied on the EEG by generalized spike/polyspike-and-wave (GSW, GPWS) complexes at 3.5-6Hz. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only is a broad and nonspecific category including all patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and an interictal EEG pattern of GSW discharges. Despite the strong heritability and the recent advances in genetic technology, the genetic basis of IGEs remains largely elusive and only in a small minority of patients with classic IGE phenotypes is a monogenic cause identified. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), early infantile encephalopathy with suppression bursts, West syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, once classified among the generalized epilepsies, are now considered to be epileptic encephalopathies. Among them, only Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is characterized by prominent generalized clinical and EEG features.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome			234	Generalized epilepsies.

Therefore, A. fumigatus colonisation in the CF population may be underestimated. Sputum (n = 60) from 25 children with CF were collected and A. fumigatus was detected using routine culture (CM1), enhanced culture (CM2) and ITS1 qPCR. The prevalence of A. fumigatus in this young CF population was 68% by qPCR and only 16% by CM1. CM1, CM2 and qPCR detected A. fumigatus in 8%, 22% and 53% of samples, respectively. qPCR had a 94.2% and 77.4% increased odds of detecting A. fumigatus over CM1 and CM2, respectively. Molecular methods proved superior for detecting A. fumigatus in CF sputum. A. fumigatus is likely more prevalent in early CF disease than is currently reported.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

We assessed patients receiving omalizumab for asthma or ABPA in the Toronto adult CF center between 2005 and 2017. We evaluated treatment safety and efficacy by analyzing changes in FEV1% predicted (FEV1pp) max value, slope and variability captured by the area under the curve (AUC), the cumulative dose of systemic corticosteroids (SCS), use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and hospitalization days before omalizumab and up to 1 year after treatment initiation. Linear mixed effects model was used for FEV1pp slope and the trapezoidal rule for FEV1pp AUC. Twenty-seven CF patients received omalizumab, 16 (59.3%) for asthma and 11 (40.7%) for ABPA. No significant omalizumab-related adverse effects were observed. In the asthmatic group, the max value of FEV1pp improved on omalizumab and the cumulative dose of SCS decreased. In the ABPA group, the rate of FEV1pp decline (slope) and the variability of FEV1pp (AUC) improved on omalizumab. In ABPA patients, the cumulative SCS dose was not significantly different but 4 (36%) patients decreased their SCS dose by >50% compared to baseline. Days on IV antibiotics and hospital days did not differ significantly before and while on omalizumab therapy. In adult CF patients with difficult-to-treat asthma or ABPA, omalizumab should be considered. Larger studies are needed to identify patient characteristics that may predict response to omalizumab.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

31420175	Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation in a pancreatic-sufficient cystic fibrosis patient	For children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) suffering from acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), abdominal pain can be severe, difficult to treat, impair their quality of life, affect participation at school, and can lead to chronic opioid dependence. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is an uncommon treatment that is reserved for refractory cases of ARP. We present a case of a 4 year old female with pancreatic-sufficient CF, refractory ARP, frequent hospital admissions for abdominal pain, and continued growth failure despite gastrostomy tube and parenteral nutrition. One year after successful TPIAT, the patient is insulin-independent, growing well, and has not been re-hospitalized for abdominal pain. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with CF to undergo TPIAT for debilitating ARP. With CFTR modulators restoring some pancreatic function, CF clinicians should have increased vigilance for the development of ARP.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

For children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) suffering from acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), abdominal pain can be severe, difficult to treat, impair their quality of life, affect participation at school, and can lead to chronic opioid dependence. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is an uncommon treatment that is reserved for refractory cases of ARP. We present a case of a 4 year old female with pancreatic-sufficient CF, refractory ARP, frequent hospital admissions for abdominal pain, and continued growth failure despite gastrostomy tube and parenteral nutrition. One year after successful TPIAT, the patient is insulin-independent, growing well, and has not been re-hospitalized for abdominal pain. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient with CF to undergo TPIAT for debilitating ARP. With CFTR modulators restoring some pancreatic function, CF clinicians should have increased vigilance for the development of ARP.
31428412	A high prevalence of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with cystic fibrosis is detected using tools already validated in other GI disorders	People with cystic fibrosis (CF) report a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, independent of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (PEI), reminiscent of other chronic GI disorders. There are currently no accepted or validated assessment tools and neither the range, frequency nor severity of GI symptoms has been systematically described in CF. We present results of a cross-sectional study using established tools and compare them to current measures of quality of life (QOL). Consecutive patients attending specialist CF appointments were asked to complete questionnaires including the GI Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R). Questionnaire terminology was altered to replace references to 'IBS' with 'GI symptoms'. In total, 107 patients were recruited (mean age, 27.8 ± 9.6 years; 60 female), and 94 (88%) had PEI. Body mass index was 22.1 ± 3.6 kg/m2, forced expiratory volume in one second was 59 + 27.7% predicted. Fifty-three (49.5%) were p.Phe508del homozygous. Overall 69/107 (65%) reported significant GI symptoms independent of PEI or adherence to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), with the four most frequent being attributable to the lower GI tract: bloating/distension, flatulence, abdominal pain and borborygmi (gurgling). There was no numerical correlation between any CFQ-R domain (particularly Digestion domain) and GSRS or SSS. This is the first systematic study measuring GI symptoms in CF using validated GI tools. Symptoms are not related to PERT or genotype and appear to be captured well by the GSRS. Further research will study longitudinal changes with treatment, and therapeutic trials in CF may use these tools to demonstrate a positive impact on 'non-respiratory' symptoms and QOL.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

31435640	Synaptic clustering differences due to different GABRB3 mutations cause variable epilepsy syndromes	GABRB3 is highly expressed early in the developing brain, and its encoded β3 subunit is critical for GABAA receptor assembly and trafficking as well as stem cell differentiation in embryonic brain. To date, over 400 mutations or variants have been identified in GABRB3. Mutations in GABRB3 have been increasingly recognized as a major cause for severe paediatric epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and infantile spasms with intellectual disability as well as relatively mild epilepsy syndromes such as childhood absence epilepsy. There is no plausible molecular pathology for disease phenotypic heterogeneity. Here we used a very high-throughput flow cytometry assay to evaluate the impact of multiple human mutations in GABRB3 on receptor trafficking. In this study we found that surface expression of mutant β3 subunits is variable. However, it was consistent that surface expression of partnering γ2 subunits was lower when co-expressed with mutant than with wild-type subunits. Because γ2 subunits are critical for synaptic GABAA receptor clustering, this provides an important clue for understanding the pathophysiology of GABRB3 mutations. To validate our findings further, we obtained an in-depth comparison of two novel mutations [GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K)] associated with epilepsy with different severities of epilepsy phenotype. GABRB3 (N328D) is associated with the relatively severe Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and GABRB3 (E357K) is associated with the relatively mild juvenile absence epilepsy syndrome. With functional characterizations in both heterologous cells and rodent cortical neurons by patch-clamp recordings, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting, we found that both the GABRB3 (N328D) and GABRB3 (E357K) mutations reduced total subunit expression in neurons but not in HEK293T cells. Both mutant subunits, however, were reduced on the cell surface and in synapses, but the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome mutant β3 (N328D) subunit was more reduced than the juvenile absence epilepsy mutant β3 (E357K) subunit. Interestingly, both mutant β3 subunits impaired postsynaptic clustering of wild-type GABAA receptor γ2 subunits and prevented γ2 subunits from incorporating into GABAA receptors at synapses, although by different cellular mechanisms. Importantly, wild-type γ2 subunits were reduced and less clustered at inhibitory synapses in Gabrb3+/- knockout mice. This suggests that impaired receptor localization to synapses is a common pathophysiological mechanism for GABRB3 mutations, although the extent of impairment may be different among mutant subunits. The study thus identifies the novel mechanism of impaired targeting of receptors containing mutant β3 subunits and provides critical insights into understanding how GABRB3 mutations produce severe epilepsy syndromes and epilepsy phenotypic heterogeneity.

31468518	Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function de novo CACNA1A mutations cause severe developmental epileptic encephalopathies in the spectrum of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are genetically heterogeneous severe childhood-onset epilepsies with developmental delay or cognitive deficits. In this study, we explored the pathogenic mechanisms of DEE-associated de novo mutations in the CACNA1A gene. We studied the functional impact of four de novo DEE-associated CACNA1A mutations, including the previously described p.A713T variant and three novel variants (p.V1396M, p.G230V, and p.I1357S). Mutant cDNAs were expressed in HEK293 cells, and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted to test the impacts on CaV 2.1 channel function. Channel localization and structure were assessed with immunofluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) modeling. We find that the G230V and I1357S mutations result in loss-of-function effects with reduced whole-cell current densities and decreased channel expression at the cell membrane. By contrast, the A713T and V1396M variants resulted in gain-of-function effects with increased whole-cell currents and facilitated current activation (hyperpolarized shift). The A713T variant also resulted in slower current decay. 3D modeling predicts conformational changes favoring channel opening for A713T and V1396M. Our findings suggest that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function CACNA1A mutations are associated with similarly severe DEEs and that functional validation is required to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and to guide therapies.

31501050	Pharmacokinetics of colistin after nebulization or intravenous administration of colistin methanesulphonate (Colimycin®) to cystic fibrosis patients	Colistin, administered as the prodrug colistin methanesulphonate (CMS), is an antibiotic frequently administered as aerosol in cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. Our aim was to assess the plasma PK of colistin in CF patients treated with CMS administered intravenously or as aerosol and to compare these results with those previously reported in healthy volunteers. Six CF patients were included, CMS and colistin concentrations were measured in plasma, urine and sputum. Either after single intravenous administration of 2 Million International Unit (MIU) or after repeated nebulizations of 2 MIU of CMS. PK of CMS and colistin were assessed by a mixed effect modeling approach. Renal clearance of CMS was lower in CF patients compared to that previously reported in healthy volunteers (64.3 mL/min (RSE = 15%) vs. 103 mL/min (RSE = 8%)). However, apparent clearance of colistin was higher in CF patients compared to healthy volunteers (124 mL/min (RSE = 13%) vs. 48.7 mL/min (RSE = 15%)), resulting in reduced systemic exposure to colistin (dose normalized AUC (2 MIU) of 7.4 h.mg/L/MIU vs. 11.2 h.mg/L/MIU). After repeated nebulizations, colistin concentrations were very low in plasma (<0.21 mg/L). Although our study suggests a lower median dose normalized colistin plasma concentrations in CF patients compared with healthy controls, this difference was not significant and a larger study is needed to substantiate this.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

31540324	Endoglin Protein Interactome Profiling Identifies TRIM21 and Galectin-3 as New Binding Partners	Endoglin is a 180-kDa glycoprotein receptor primarily expressed by the vascular endothelium and involved in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Heterozygous mutations in the endoglin gene (ENG) cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, a vascular disease that presents with nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. A circulating form of endoglin (alias soluble endoglin, sEng), proteolytically released from the membrane-bound protein, has been observed in several inflammation-related pathological conditions and appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cancer development through unknown mechanisms. Membrane-bound endoglin is an auxiliary component of the TGF-β receptor complex and the extracellular region of endoglin has been shown to interact with types I and II TGF-β receptors, as well as with BMP9 and BMP10 ligands, both members of the TGF-β family. To search for novel protein interactors, we screened a microarray containing over 9000 unique human proteins using recombinant sEng as bait. We find that sEng binds with high affinity, at least, to 22 new proteins. Among these, we validated the interaction of endoglin with galectin-3, a secreted member of the lectin family with capacity to bind membrane glycoproteins, and with tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Using human endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that endoglin co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with galectin-3 or TRIM21. These results open new research avenues on endoglin function and regulation.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

Retrospective analytic chart review. We performed a chart review that included all patients with HHT treated with intranasal bevacizumab and cyanoacrylate glue for refractory epistaxis at Lariboisiere University Hospital from 2013 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. We injected 100 mg (25 mg/mL) of bevacizumab diluted in 2 mL of serum at the base of the telangiectasias, and sclerotherapy with an injection of cyanoacrylate glue was used adjunctively. Treatment efficacy was based on changes in Epistaxis Severity Scores (ESS) and the Bergler-Sadick Scale. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder (CL) and Likert scale, respectively. Thirty-one patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 26.6 months. The average ESS score significantly decreased from 7.82 to 3.89 (P < .05). The Bergler-Sadick score significantly improved (P < .05) following the treatment, including the frequency (from 2.74 to 1.64) and the quantity (from 2.54 to 1.51) scales. Quality of life was significantly improved (P < .05) using the CL score (from 4.16 to 7.22). The Likert satisfaction scale related to the treatment efficacy was high, with an average of 7.03 out of 10. No complications were noted.

31615556	Prospective pilot study of Floseal® for the treatment of anterior epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)	Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting more than 98% of adults with HHT, with significant impact on quality of life. Floseal® has been shown to be effective for the management of anterior epistaxis, but has yet to be thoroughly evaluated in this population. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Floseal® for managing acute anterior epistaxis in patients with HHT. A pilot prospective clinical trial was conducted at two tertiary referral centres, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada and The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. All patients with HHT presenting with acute anterior epistaxis to the two study centres, who enrolled in the study, received Floseal® treatment. The primary outcome measures were achievement of hemostasis and changes in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) between baseline and one-month follow up. Secondary outcome measure included clinical assessment of the nasal cavity. Seven patients were included in the final analysis. All patients underwent treatment of anterior epistaxis with Floseal® and achieved control of epistaxis within 15-min post-application. Application of Floseal® was well tolerated, with patients reporting a pain score of 3 ± 3.13 out of 10. There was no statistically significant difference noted in ESS scores pre-treatment and one-month follow up, 6.27 ± 2.42 vs. 4.50 ± 2.44, p = 0.179.

31678406	Arfgef1 haploinsufficiency in mice alters neuronal endosome composition and decreases membrane surface postsynaptic GABAA receptors.	ARFGEF1 encodes a guanine exchange factor involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, and is a candidate gene for childhood genetic epilepsies. To model ARFGEF1 haploinsufficiency observed in a recent Lennox Gastaut Syndrome patient, we studied a frameshift mutation (Arfgef1fs) in mice. Arfgef1fs/+ pups exhibit signs of developmental delay, and Arfgef1fs/+ adults have a significantly decreased threshold to induced seizures but do not experience spontaneous seizures. Histologically, the Arfgef1fs/+ brain exhibits a disruption in the apical lining of the dentate gyrus and altered spine morphology of deep layer neurons. In primary hippocampal neuron culture, dendritic surface and synaptic but not total GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are reduced in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons with an accompanying decrease in the number of GABAAR-containing recycling endosomes in cell body. Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in the number of GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body.

ARFGEF1 encodes a guanine exchange factor involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, and is a candidate gene for childhood genetic epilepsies. To model ARFGEF1 haploinsufficiency observed in a recent Lennox Gastaut Syndrome patient, we studied a frameshift mutation (Arfgef1fs) in mice. Arfgef1fs/+ pups exhibit signs of developmental delay, and Arfgef1fs/+ adults have a significantly decreased threshold to induced seizures but do not experience spontaneous seizures. Histologically, the Arfgef1fs/+ brain exhibits a disruption in the apical lining of the dentate gyrus and altered spine morphology of deep layer neurons. In primary hippocampal neuron culture, dendritic surface and synaptic but not total GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are reduced in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons with an accompanying decrease in the number of GABAAR-containing recycling endosomes in cell body. Arfgef1fs/+ neurons also display differences in the relative ratio of Arf6+:Rab11+:TrfR+ recycling endosomes. Although the GABAAR-containing early endosomes in Arfgef1fs/+ neurons are comparable to wildtype, Arfgef1fs/+ neurons show an increase in the number of GABAAR-containing lysosomes in dendrite and cell body. Together, the altered endosome composition and decreased neuronal surface GABAAR results suggests a mechanism whereby impaired neuronal inhibition leads to seizure susceptibility.
31689244	Correcting Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 treats pathology in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia models	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1/ENG/Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs - including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs - and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

31706070	Male gender and unemployment are associated with lower levels of perceived social support in adults with cystic fibrosis	Adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) face unique challenges with regard to the attainment and maintenance of social support. Although social support has been shown to improve treatment outcomes in other patient-populations, research on social support in adults with CF is limited. In fact, no studies have examined factors associated with less perceived social support in this population. The current study aimed to fill this gap, thus providing CF care teams with empirical evidence about who may be most likely to lack support and inform future intervention. Participants in this cross-sectional study included 233 adults with CF who were part of a larger, longitudinal study. Participants completed the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, a measure of social support, and attended routine clinical visits where measures of disease severity were obtained. Being female and employed were associated with greater perceptions of social support in this sample. Age, income, education, marital status, and disease-severity were not related to perceptions of social support. The present study revealed that individuals with CF who are unemployed and those who are male perceived having lower social support, perhaps identifying subgroups for whom targeted interventions may be appropriate.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

31708334	New anti-epileptic drugs in Paediatrics	It is estimated that about 70 million people all over the world suffer from epilepsy, half of which are children, in whom the prevalence is around 0.5 to 0.8%. Although there are several therapies, the treatment of epilepsy is based mainly on drugs, which, depending on the year of coming onto the market are classified as first, second, or third generation. In this article, a description is presented on the main characteristics of the latest generation of anti-epileptic drugs (lacosamide, eslicarbazepine acetate, brivaracetam, perampanel, retigabine, everolimus and cannabidiol). These, with the exception of retigabine (is not yet on the market), are considered safe and effective in the paediatric population. Everolimus and cannabidiol have very specific indications (tuberous sclerosis, Dravet syndrome, and Lennox Gastaut syndrome), while the rest are indicated in the management of seizures of focal origin in children from 4 years-old. These new molecules have been developed in order to provide a pharmaceutical profile and tolerance superior to the previously available drugs, and it is forecast that as their use increases, their true potential and profile will widen. Furthermore, for the first time in Paediatric Epileptology, the extrapolation of the efficacy data in adults have been used (together with specific safety and pharmacokinetic studies in the paediatric population), in order to speed up their approval for use in the child population.

31770718	Cognitive and functional status in late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Variation on a classic phenotype	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) denotes a refractory epileptic encephalopathy of childhood onset with the triad of generalized slow spike-wave (GSSW) on interictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), multiple seizure types, and intellectual impairment. The neurobiology of LGS is said to sustain abnormal patterns of brain activity and connectivity that ultimately impair normal cerebral developmental mechanisms. However, we describe eight patients from our combined practice who presented with electroclinical findings consistent with LGS but without significant cognitive impairment. All patients fulfilled the other criteria of LGS with multiple seizure types (three or more of generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, myoclonic, and atypical absence) and GSSW activity on EEG. Four subjects completed high school, two completed some college, two acquired college degrees, and all performed basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) independently. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in all patients. We speculate that a variation of the classic phenotype of LGS can present with preserved cognitive and functional status, often with onset in the second decade of life, and associated with normal brain imaging.

31828546	BMP10-mediated ALK1 signaling is continuously required for vascular development and maintenance.	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal-dominant vascular disorder characterized by development of high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that can lead to stroke or high-output heart failure. HHT2 is caused by heterozygous mutations in ACVRL1, which encodes an endothelial cell bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK1. BMP9 and BMP10 are established ALK1 ligands. However, the unique and overlapping roles of these ligands remain poorly understood. To define the physiologically relevant ALK1 ligand(s) required for vascular development and maintenance, we generated zebrafish harboring mutations in bmp9 and duplicate BMP10 paralogs, bmp10 and bmp10-like. bmp9 mutants survive to adulthood with no overt phenotype. In contrast, combined loss of bmp10 and bmp10-like results in embryonic lethal cranial AVMs indistinguishable from acvrl1 mutants. However, despite embryonic functional redundancy of bmp10 and bmp10-like, bmp10 encodes the only required Alk1 ligand in the juvenile-to-adult period. bmp10 mutants exhibit blood vessel abnormalities in anterior skin and liver, heart dysmorphology, and premature death, and vascular defects correlate with increased cardiac output. Together, our findings support a unique role for Bmp10 as a non-redundant Alk1 ligand required to maintain the post-embryonic vasculature and establish zebrafish bmp10 mutants as a model for AVM-associated high-output heart failure, which is an increasingly recognized complication of severe liver involvement in HHT2.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

31829726	A Novel X-Linked Variant of IQSEC2  is Associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Mild Intellectual Disability in Three Generations of a Korean Family	Aim:  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe type of childhood-onset epilepsy with multiple types of seizures, specific discharges on electroencephalography, and intellectual disability. However, LGS-related genes are largely unknown. To identify causative genes related to LGS, we collected and analyzed data from a three-generation Korean family in which one member had LGS and two had intellectual disability.  Methods:  Genomic DNAs were extracted from blood samples of all participants and used in whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic variants were detected by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was evaluated by prediction programs and the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. The LGS patient had generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges, multiple types of seizures, and developmental delay.  Results:  Analyses of the WES data from the family revealed a novel variant (c.1048G>A, p.Ala350Thr) in the IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2). This variant is within a highly evolutionarily conserved IQ-like motif, indicating a decrease in the calmodulin-binding capacity or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid transmission. The hemizygous variant in the male with LGS was a maternally inherited X-linked variant from the heterozygous maternal grandmother and mother, both of whom had intellectual disability.  Conclusion:  These findings indicate that the variant of IQSEC2 triggered both LGS and intellectual disability dependent on sex in this family. We report a novel X-linked inherited IQSEC2 variant for LGS and intellectual disability, which enhances the spectrum of variants in the IQ-like motif of IQSEC2.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

31833952	The cannabidiol conundrum: potential benefits and risks of cannabidiol products for children	Since the federal ban on hemp products was lifted in December 2018, cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid derived from hemp, has become increasingly popular and accessible. CBD is sold in the form of oils, tablets, and foods in locations including gas stations, cafés, and drug stores. Despite a lack of reliable evidence, many parents praise its purported therapeutic effects on a variety of childhood ailments. Epidiolex was the first CBD-based medication to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, known as Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome, in patients of at least 2 years of age. Its efficacy was assessed through three randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled trials in a sample of 516 patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Despite this development, there are few or no large-scale, rigorous studies concerning the effects of CBD on any other pediatric conditions that parents have tried to alleviate with CBD. The purpose of this review is to explore recent literature regarding the efficacy and safety of CBD in treating various health conditions in children; the risks of consuming CBD products, and the role of pediatricians in helping parents navigate often-confusing information about CBD. Although CBD use has dramatically increased in recent years, both its potential to treat conditions and its risks have not yet been subjected to rigorous study. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks posed by poor-quality standards and labeling practices for cannabinoid products. Due to the confusing nature of the numerous sources of information about CBD, pediatricians are in a position to provide and clarify information about CBD to parents and understand the risks it poses to children.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes with structural brain lesions including focal abnormalities or asymmetric slow-spike-wave (SSW) patterns remain largely unknown. Due to the contradictory lateralization difference between MRI lesions and EEG pattern in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes, it is difficult to determine the precise lateralization of epileptic lesions, which is crucial to better surgical prognosis. This study is aim to ascertain the clinical characteristics of the EEG patterns, and its relationship with MRI lesions and to evaluate its prognostic value of surgical treatment in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Twenty-four symptomatic LGS cases with asymmetric EEG SSW patterns and contralaterally independent or contralaterally dominant MRI lesions were collected, and their clinical features were analyzed retrospectively. In this cohort, most of lesions were perinatal or acquired during the first 6 months of life. The most common etiology was intracerebral hemorrhage. The LGS patients with both asymmetric SSW and focal sporadic epileptic waves (SEW) patterns showed the best surgical outcome with Engel class I level. Asymmetric SSW patterns with maximal discharges contralateral to MRI lesions were frequently observed in most of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Predominantly diffuse destructive lesions led to an attenuated voltage of ipsilateral scalp EEG producing an asymmetric SSW pattern in those patients with symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Our study reveals a special SEW EEG pattern in symptomatic LG patients with asymmetric SSW and MRI lesions contralateral to the dominant EEG patterns. Contradictory lateralization difference between MRI and EEG probably arises from the relative voltage attenuation presenting in EEG ipsilateral to huge destructive lesions from early life. Our study suggests that the independent focal SEW activity remaining ipsilateral to the MRI lesion can potentially predict better surgical prognosis in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes.

31855252	Homozygous STXBP1 variant causes encephalopathy and gain-of-function in synaptic transmission	Heterozygous mutations in the STXBP1 gene encoding the presynaptic protein MUNC18-1 cause STXBP1 encephalopathy, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Impaired mutant protein stability leading to reduced synaptic transmission is considered the main underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Here, we report the first two cases carrying a homozygous STXBP1 mutation, where their heterozygous siblings and mother are asymptomatic. Both cases were diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In Munc18-1 null mouse neurons, protein stability of the disease variant (L446F) is less dramatically affected than previously observed for heterozygous disease mutants. Neurons expressing Munc18L446F showed minor changes in morphology and synapse density. However, patch clamp recordings demonstrated that L446F causes a 2-fold increase in evoked synaptic transmission. Conversely, paired pulse plasticity was reduced and recovery after stimulus trains also. Spontaneous release frequency and amplitude, the readily releasable vesicle pool and the kinetics of short-term plasticity were all normal. Hence, the homozygous L446F mutation causes a gain-of-function phenotype regarding release probability and synaptic transmission while having less impact on protein levels than previously reported (heterozygous) mutations. These data show that STXBP1 mutations produce divergent cellular effects, resulting in different clinical features, while sharing the overarching encephalopathic phenotype (developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy).

31910122	Clinical Practice Guideline: Nosebleed (Epistaxis) Executive Summary	Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the great majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds. The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It will focus on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians with phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients, patients with hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function, are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the working group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based upon their experience and assessment of individual patients. The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications.

(5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds.

31916540	The role of cannabinoids in epilepsy treatment: a critical review of efficacy results from clinical trials	CBD was shown to have anti-seizure activity based on in vitro and in vivo models. However, several reports of small series or case reports of the use of cannabis extracts in epilepsy yielded contradictory results and the efficacy of cannabis use in patients with epilepsy have also been inconclusive. In 2013, the first Phase 1 trial for a purified form of CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex; >99% CBD), developed by GW Pharma, showed some efficacy signals and subsequently, a comprehensive program on the efficacy and tolerability of this compound for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies was initiated. Results of these trials led to the FDA and EMA approval respectively in 2018 and 2019 for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare epilepsies: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients two years of age and older. Thus, CBD became the first FDA-approved purified drug substance derived from cannabis and also the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of seizures in DS. We detail the clinical studies using purified CBD (Epidiolex/Epidyolex), including the first open interventional exploratory study and Randomized Control Ttrials for DS and LGS.

31941643	Source of cannabinoids: what is available, what is used, and where does it come from?	Cannabis sativa L. is an ancient medicinal plant wherefrom over 120 cannabinoids are extracted. In the past two decades, there has been increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based treatments for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, and there is now evidence for the medical use of cannabis and its effectiveness for a wide range of diseases. Cannabinoid treatments for pain and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (Nabiximols) have been approved in several countries. Cannabidiol (CBD), in contrast to tetra-hydro-cannabidiol (THC), is not a controlled substance in the European Union, and over the years there has been increasing use of CBD-enriched extracts and pure CBD for seizure disorders, particularly in children. No analytical controls are mandatory for CBD-based products and a pronounced variability in CBD concentrations in commercialized CBD oil preparations has been identified. Randomized controlled trials of plant-derived CBD for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) have provided evidence of anti-seizure effects, and in June 2018, CBD was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an add-on antiepileptic drug for patients two years of age and older with LGS or DS. Medical cannabis, with various ratios of CBD and THC and in different galenic preparations, is licensed in many European countries for several indications, and in July 2019, the European Medicines Agency also granted marketing authorisation for CBD in association with clobazam, for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS. The purpose of this article is to review the availability of cannabis-based products and cannabinoid-based medicines, together with current regulations regarding indications in Europe (as of July 2019). The lack of approval by the central agencies, as well as social and political influences, have led to significant variation in usage between countries.

31941644	Adverse effects of cannabinoids	Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid-derived product that has recently been approved for the treatment of pharmacoresistant seizures in patients with epileptic encephalopathies such as Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Short-term side effects of cannabidiol are well know and well-documented in the clinical trials that lead to its approval. Generally, is a well tolerated drug with transitory, dose-dependent mild to moderate effects like somnolence, decreased appetite or diarrhoea. However severe life-threatening reactions can also occur, and are often related to the non-controlled toxic combination with other antiseizure drugs that are widely used in this type of patients like sodium valproate or clobazam. In this brief review we summarize the available data about the short-term adverse events of cannabidiol. Further studies are required to assess the long-term outcome and final resolution of these conditions regarding safety of these patients.

31955962	Impact of the transition period from childhood to adulthood in cystic fibrosis	The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the transition period from childhood to adulthood in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) being followed up in our reference center. The clinical, functional, inflammatory and microbiological parameters of all transition patients were compared two years before (T-2) and two years after the transfer (T+2) from paediatric to adult centers and further analysed according to whether the transition conditions were optimal or suboptimal. Twenty-eight patients were included. The mean age at the transfer visit was 19.5 years (±3.5). There were no deaths during the study period. Consultations were more numerous at T-2 [14.5 (±5.9) vs. 12.0 (±5.1), P<0.004]. Chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequent at T+2 (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P=0.021). A progressive decrease in FEV1 and FVC was observed between T-2 and T+2. The number of pulmonary exacerbations was lower in the optimal transition group. The period of transition from childhood to adulthood in patients with CF appears to be associated with functional and microbiological changes.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

A randomized controlled trial was performed randomizing individual PAVMs to treatment with IDC versus Nester coils at the largest hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center in Canada. The primary outcome was CT evidence of reperfusion at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural complications, fluoroscopy time and contrast volume. Our study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and subsequent expiration of funding. A total of 46 PAVMs in 25 patients (64% female) were included in our study; 26 randomized to Nester coils and 20 randomized to IDC. One patient was lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 421.2 ± 215.7 days, no significant difference in PAVM reperfusion was detected between Nester coils and IDC (0% vs. 5.6%, p > 0.05). No major periprocedural complications were noted in either group. Fluoroscopy time (Nester: 15.0 ± 11.8 min vs. IDC 16.0 ± 5.4 min, p > 0.05) and contrast volume (Nester: 80.3 ± 36.5 ml vs. IDC 87.3 ± 51.7 ml, p > 0.05) utilized did not differ between groups.

32062104	EEF1A2 mutations in epileptic encephalopathy/intellectual disability: Understanding the potential mechanism of phenotypic variation	EEF1A2 encodes protein elongation factor 1-alpha 2, which is involved in Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. De novo mutations in EEF1A2 have been identified in patients with extensive neurological deficits, including intractable epilepsy, globe developmental delay, and severe intellectual disability. However, the mechanism underlying phenotype variation is unknown. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified a novel and a recurrent de novo mutation, c.294C>A; p.(Phe98Leu) and c.208G>A; p.(Gly70Ser), in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The further systematic analysis revealed that all EEF1A2 mutations were associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability, suggesting its critical role in neurodevelopment. Missense mutations with severe molecular alteration in the t-RNA binding sites or GTP hydrolysis domain were associated with early-onset severe epilepsy, indicating that the clinical expression was potentially determined by the location of mutations and alteration of molecular effects. This study highlights the potential genotype-phenotype relationship in EEF1A2 and facilitates the evaluation of the pathogenicity of EEF1A2 mutations in clinical practice.

32078368	Impaired SMAD1/5 Mechanotransduction and Cx37 (Connexin37) Expression Enable Pathological Vessel Enlargement and Shunting	Impaired ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1)/Endoglin/BMP9 (bone morphogenetic protein 9) signaling predisposes to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activation of SMAD1/5 signaling can be enhanced by shear stress. In the genetic disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which is characterized by arteriovenous malformations, the affected receptors are those involved in the activation of mechanosensitive SMAD1/5 signaling. To elucidate how genetic and mechanical signals interact in AVM development, we sought to identify targets differentially regulated by BMP9 and shear stress. Approach and Results: We identify Cx37 (Connexin37) as a differentially regulated target of ligand-induced and mechanotransduced SMAD1/5 signaling. We show that stimulation of endothelial cells with BMP9 upregulated Cx37, whereas shear stress inhibited this expression. This signaling was SMAD1/5-dependent, and in the absence of SMAD1/5, there was an inversion of the expression pattern. Ablated SMAD1/5 signaling alone caused AVM-like vascular malformations directly connecting the dorsal aorta to the inlet of the heart. In yolk sacs of mouse embryos with an endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5, addition of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), which downregulates Cx37, induced development of these direct connections bypassing the yolk sac capillary bed. In wild-type embryos undergoing vascular remodeling, Cx37 was globally expressed by endothelial cells but was absent in regions of enlarging vessels. TNFα and endothelial-specific compound heterozygosity for SMAD1/5 caused ectopic regions lacking Cx37 expression, which correlated to areas of vascular malformations. Mechanistically, loss of Cx37 impairs correct directional migration under flow conditions. Our data demonstrate that Cx37 expression is differentially regulated by shear stress and SMAD1/5 signaling, and that reduced Cx37 expression is permissive for capillary enlargement into shunts.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

32096470	Epilepsy and cannabidiol: a guide to treatment	The growing interest in cannabidiol (CBD), specifically a pure form of CBD, as a treatment for epilepsy, among other conditions, is reflected in recent changes in legislation in some countries. Although there has been much speculation about the therapeutic value of cannabis-based products as an anti-seizure treatment for some time, it is only within the last two years that Class I evidence has been available for a pure form of CBD, based on placebo-controlled RCTs for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. However, just as we are beginning to understand the significance of CBD as a treatment for epilepsy, in recent years, a broad spectrum of products advertised to contain CBD has emerged on the market. The effects of these products are fundamentally dependent on the purity, preparation, and concentration of CBD and other components, and consensus and standardisation are severely lacking regarding their preparation, composition, usage and effectiveness. This review aims to provide information to neurologists and epileptologists on the therapeutic value of CBD products, principally a purified form, in routine practice for patients with intractable epilepsy.

32096543	Noncanonical Wnt planar cell polarity signaling in lung development and disease	The planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway is a potent developmental regulator of directional cell behaviors such as migration, asymmetric division and morphological polarization that are critical for shaping the body axis and the complex three-dimensional architecture of tissues and organs. PCP is considered a noncanonical Wnt pathway due to the involvement of Wnt ligands and Frizzled family receptors in the absence of the beta-catenin driven gene expression observed in the canonical Wnt cascade. At the heart of the PCP mechanism are protein complexes capable of generating molecular asymmetries within cells along a tissue-wide axis that are translated into polarized actin and microtubule cytoskeletal dynamics. PCP has emerged as an important regulator of developmental, homeostatic and disease processes in the respiratory system. It acts along other signaling pathways to create the elaborately branched structure of the lung by controlling the directional protrusive movements of cells during branching morphogenesis. PCP operates in the airway epithelium to establish and maintain the orientation of respiratory cilia along the airway axis for anatomically directed mucociliary clearance. It also regulates the establishment of the pulmonary vasculature. In adult tissues, PCP dysfunction has been linked to a variety of chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, stemming chiefly from the breakdown of proper tissue structure and function and aberrant cell migration during regenerative wound healing. A better understanding of these (impaired) PCP mechanisms is needed to fully harness the therapeutic opportunities of targeting PCP in chronic lung diseases.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32115388	Cystic Fibrosis Foundation consensus guidelines for the care of individuals with advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease	Advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease (ACFLD) is common, is associated with reduced quality of life, and remains the most frequent cause of death in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). These consensus guidelines provide recommendations to the CF community on management of both common and unique issues that arise when individuals reach a state of ACFLD. The CF Foundation assembled a multidisciplinary expert panel consisting of three workgroups: Pulmonary management; Management of comorbid conditions; Symptom management and psychosocial issues. Topics were excluded if the management considerations did not differ in ACFLD from in the overall CF population or if already addressed in other published guidelines. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review combined with expert opinion when appropriate. The committee formulated twenty-three recommendation statements specific to ACFLD that address the definition of ACFLD, pulmonary and intensive care unit management, management of selected comorbidities, symptom control, and psychosocial issues. These recommendations are intended to be paired with previously published management guidelines for the overall CF population, with the objective of reducing practice variability and improving overall care, quality of life, and survival in those with ACFLD.	cystic fibrosis			225	Cystic Fibrosis Foundation consensus guidelines for the care of individuals with advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease.

32147452	Lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis.	The contribution of lung transplantation to the treatment of patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) has been debated. We aimed to describe achievable outcomes from high-volume CF and lung transplant programs. This study reports on the largest single-center experience of lung transplantation for adult and pediatric patients with CF. It also highlights the evolution of practice and outcomes over time. A retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected Toronto Lung Transplant database was carried out. Post-transplant survival in CF was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed with log-rank tests. From 1983 to 2016, a total of 1,885 transplants were performed at our institution, where 364 (19.3%) were CF recipients and another 39 (2.1%) were CF retransplants. The mean age at first transplant was 29.5 ± 9.7 years where 56.6% were males and 91.5% were adults. Pre-transplantation, 88 patients (24.2%) were Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC)-positive, 143 (39.3%) had diabetes mellitus, and the mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 26.0 ± 7.2%, as predicted at listing. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year probabilities of survival in adults who were BCC-negative were 94%, 70%, and 53%, respectively. Pediatric, BCC-positive, and retransplant recipients had worse survival than adult patients who were BCC-negative. Strategies to improve the donor pool did not affect survival but possibly reduced waitlist mortality. For the entire cohort, the most common causes of death after lung transplant were infection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Lung transplantation for CF provides excellent short- and long-term outcomes. These results strongly support lung transplantation as the standard of care for patients with CF having advanced lung disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		319	Lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis.. The contribution of lung transplantation to the treatment of patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) has been debated. We aimed to describe achievable outcomes from high-volume CF and lung transplant programs. This study reports on the largest single-center experience of lung transplantation for adult and pediatric patients with CF. It also highlights the evolution of practice and outcomes over time. A retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected Toronto Lung Transplant database was carried out. Post-transplant survival in CF was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed with log-rank tests. From 1983 to 2016, a total of 1,885 transplants were performed at our institution, where 364 (19.3%) were CF recipients and another 39 (2.1%) were CF retransplants.

32162080	Lung T1 mapping magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of pulmonary disease in children with cystic fibrosis: a pilot study.	Assessment tools for early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease are limited. Detecting early pulmonary disease is crucial to increasing life expectancy by starting interventions to slow the progression of the pulmonary disease with the many treatment options available. To compare the utility of lung T1-mapping MRI with ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI in children with cystic fibrosis in detecting early stage lung disease and monitoring pulmonary exacerbations. We performed a prospective study in 16 children between September 2017 and January 2018. In Phase 1, we compared five CF patients with normal spirometry (mean 11.2 years) to five age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. In Phase 2, we longitudinally evaluated six CF patients (median 11 years) in acute pulmonary exacerbation. All children had non-contrast lung T1-mapping and UTE MRI and spirometry testing. We compared the mean normalized T1 value and percentage lung volume without T1 value in CF patients and healthy subjects in Phase 1 and during treatment in Phase 2. We also performed cystic fibrosis MRI scoring. We evaluated differences in continuous variables using standard statistical tests. In Phase 1, mean normalized T1 values of the lung were significantly lower in CF patients in comparison to healthy controls (P=0.02) except in the right lower lobe (P=0.29). The percentage lung volume without T1 value was also significantly higher in CF patients (P=0.006). UTE MRI showed no significant differences between CF patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.11). In Phase 2, excluding one outlier case who developed systemic disease in the course of treatment, the whole-lung T1 value increased (P=0.001) and perfusion scoring improved (P=0.02) following therapy. We observed no other significant changes in the MRI scoring. Lung T1-mapping MRI can detect early regional pulmonary CF disease in children and might be helpful in the assessment of acute pulmonary exacerbations.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32185791	Advances in the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Pediatric Epilepsy	Epilepsy is a common disorder in children and adults that causes significant morbidity and affects many aspects of a patient's lives. Two-thirds of patients with epilepsy are controlled with established antiseizure medications, leaving a significant number of patients searching for other options. The purpose of this **review** is to provide an overview of recent advancements in the management of treatment-resistant epilepsy in pediatric patients. Recent publications have shown the efficacy of new pharmaceutical options such as fenfluramine and cannabidiol, some of which have been tested specifically in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes such as Dravet's syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut's syndrome. Furthermore, recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of stiripentol has made available a previously difficult-to-obtain option for patients with Dravet's syndrome. Finally, implanted responsive neurostimulation devices for direct cortical stimulation and deep brain stimulation have shown efficacy in adult patients and may represent a thrilling new horizon for pediatric patients.

It cannot be easily or quickly diagnosed because of both its infrequency and its various associated symptoms. As far as its symptoms are concerned, the patient experiences recurring epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations that can lead to severe undesirable symptoms. In our case, we report a 32-year-old female that was diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia and whose paraclinical examinations showed that she suffers from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease. Management of OWRD includes systematic diagnosis of visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in regular intervals, measures to prevent complications, and symptomatic treatment.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

32206879	Ethnogeographic and inter-individual variability of human ABC transporters	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a superfamily of 48 structurally similar membrane transporters that mediate the ATP-dependent cellular export of a plethora of endogenous and xenobiotic substances. Importantly, genetic variants in ABC genes that affect gene function have clinically important effects on drug disposition and can be predictors of the risk of adverse drug reactions and efficacy of chemotherapeutics, calcium channel blockers, and protease inhibitors. Furthermore, loss-of-function of ABC transporters is associated with a variety of congenital disorders. Despite their clinical importance, information about the frequencies and global distribution of functionally relevant ABC variants is limited and little is known about the overall genetic complexity of this important gene family. **Here, we systematically mapped the genetic landscape of the entire human ABC superfamily using Next-Generation Sequencing data from 138,632 individuals across seven major populations**. Overall, we identified 62,793 exonic variants, 98.5% of which were rare. By integrating five computational prediction algorithms with structural mapping approaches using experimentally determined crystal structures, we found that the functional ABC variability is extensive and highly population-specific. Every individual harbored between 9.3 and 13.9 deleterious ABC variants, 76% of which were found only in a single population. Carrier rates of pathogenic variants in ABC transporter genes associated with autosomal recessive congenital diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or pseudoxanthoma elasticum, closely mirrored the corresponding population-specific disease prevalence, thus providing a novel resource for rare disease epidemiology. Combined, we provide the most comprehensive, systematic, and consolidated overview of ethnogeographic ABC transporter variability with important implications for personalized medicine, clinical genetics, and precision public health.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32207730	Why the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare one?	The review addresses the problem of the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Despite the presence of a vivid clinical and encephalographic picture, classical Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which meets all of its diagnostic criteria, is quite rare. Many authors believe that the diagnosis of the syndrome is possible if the patient has tonic seizures and typical ictal and interictal patterns on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The diagnosis of the syndrome is considered probable if there are typical EEG patterns of wakefulness and sleep, but no tonic seizures are recorded. Diagnosis of the syndrome is complicated by its polyetiology (clinical and EEG manifestations can vary significantly), the evolution of seizure types and EEG characteristics as the patient matures, the presence of other epileptic syndromes similar to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

32255688	CT Angiography Findings of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations in Children and Young Adults With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the CT angiography (CTA) findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to correlate these findings with those of graded contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (CE-TTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of PAVMs visualized at CTA of patients with abnormal CE-TTE findings (3-point scale). Location, distribution, size, number, volume, grade, and relative attenuation (attenuation of PAVM divided by attenuation of aorta) of PAVMs were recorded. PAVMs were graded as follows on conventional and maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images: 0, nodule, unlikely PAVM; 1, ground-glass opacity (GGO); 2, GGO with increased vascular network; 3, GGO or nodule with single vessel; 4, GGO or nodule with two or more vessels; 5, GGO or nodule with afferent and larger efferent vessels; 6, mature arteriovenous malformation. Correlation between PAVM grade and relative attenuation and between CTA variables and CE-TTE grades was assessed. RESULTS. Forty patients (median age, 14.9 years; range, 0.6-27.9 years) had 117 PAVMs at CTA: 107 peripheral, eight central, and two both peripheral and central. None of the PAVMs was diffuse. Median size and volume were 0.4 cm (range, 0.1-4.4 cm) and 0.031 mL (range, 0.0009-10.019 mL). At CTA, seven PAVMs were grade 1, five grade 2, 28 grade 3, 62 grade 4, two grade 5, and 13 grade 6. MIP images showed 39 of 117 PAVMs were higher grade. Statistically significant correlation was found between relative attenuation and PAVM grade (p < 0.001, r = 0.58) in 40 patients and between all CTA variables and CE-TTE (p < 0.05, strongest correlation with highest grades [p < 0.0001, r = 0.81]) in 32 patients. CONCLUSION. In children and young adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, grade 4 PAVMs were most common. Higher-grade PAVMs more often have right-to-left shunts.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY		403	...

32269886	Etiology, Clinical, Radiological, and Microbiological Profile of Patients with Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis at a Tertiary Care Hospital of Pakistan	Objectives To identify the etiology of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), to assess the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and microbiological profile of patients presenting with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis in a tertiary care center of Pakistan. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study where patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis proven by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were evaluated for etiology, clinical characteristics, microbiology, radiology, spirometric profile, and in-hospital outcomes. Results During the study period, 196 patients were diagnosed with NCFB. The majority of the patients were men 76.5% (n = 150) and 83.6% (n = 163) of the total patients were younger than 60 years of age. The majority of these patients (58.7%, n = 111) had a duration of symptoms between 5-10 years. The etiology of bronchiectasis was identified in 92.9% of cases. Post-infectious bronchiectasis was the most common cause (67.8%, n = 133), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (9.2%, n = 18), and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (7.1%, n = 14). Among the post infectious causes, a history of TB was present in 85% (n = 114/133) of patients. Obstructive impairment was the most common spirometric pattern, observed in 68.9% (n = 135) of patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated organism (36.2%, n = 71). Hemoptysis was the most frequent complication found in 20.9% of patients (n = 41). Out of these 196 patients, 94.4% (n = 185) received medical management and were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory failure was significantly associated with the Pseudomonas group as compared to non-pseudomonas group [(n = 21 (29%) vs n = 18 (14.4%) p = 0.01]. During hospitalization seven patients (3.6%) were died because of respiratory failure. Conclusions Post TB bronchiectasis was the leading cause of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis in this cohort, with Pseudomonas was the commonest pathogen isolated from the respiratory specimen, which was significantly associated with respiratory failure. On spirometry, obstructive impairment was found in the majority of patients and hemoptysis was the most frequent complication.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32286879	Molecular Diagnostics of Cystic Fibrosis in Serbia: Our Approach to Meet the Diagnostic Challenges.	Background: High heterogeneity levels of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) are manifested in different populations. The aim of this study was to analyze comprehensively all mutations in the CFTR gene in Serbian patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and to use the findings to propose a testing algorithm for the Serbian population. Materials and Methods: Cascade screening was employed to detect mutations in the CFTR gene of 90 patients suspected of having CF, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR-mediated site directed mutagenesis, Sanger sequencing, and/or next-generation sequencing. Results: This is the first report for the Serbian CF population where single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions, large genome rearrangements, and copy number variants were analyzed in detail. A high degree of heterogeneity within the CFTR was documented among our cohort of 90 patients. We identified 19 CF-causing mutations and 3 with varying consequences, including a previously unreported deletion of the entire exon 11. Conclusion: Considering the spectrum and frequency of mutations found, we recommend a multistep sequencing algorithm in combination with evaluation of large rearrangements for future analyses of the CFTR gene in the Serbian population.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32334364	Rufinamide as add-on therapy in children with epileptic encephalopathies other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A study of 34 patients.	Here, we present a multicenter series of patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) and related electroclinical patterns (REP) other than Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who were treated with rufinamide as add-on therapy. Medical records of 34 patients with DEE and REP other than LGS treated with add-on rufinamide seen at four pediatric neurology centers in Argentina between May 2014 and March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated 34 patients (18 males, 16 females), aged between 2 and 15 years with a mean and median age of 6 and 8 years, respectively. The children had different types of childhood-onset refractory DEE and REP other than LGS and were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 20 months (range, 12-60 months). Twenty-two of 34 patients (64.5%) who received rufinamide as add-on therapy had a greater than 50% decrease in seizures, and two patients (5.8%) became seizure-free. Four patients (11.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in four others (11.7%) and increased in two patients (5.8%). The final mean dosage of rufinamide was 31.5 ± 15.5 mg/kg per day (range, 19-75.4 mg/kg) if combined with valproic acid and of 35.4 ± 11.5 mg/kg per day (range, 8-60.5 mg/kg) without valproic acid. Adverse effects were recorded in nine patients (26.4%). A seizure increase was reported in two of 24 patients (7.3%). Rufinamide may be used as a treatment option in DEE and REP other than LGS.

We evaluated 34 patients (18 males, 16 females), aged between 2 and 15 years with a mean and median age of 6 and 8 years, respectively. The children had different types of childhood-onset refractory DEE and REP other than LGS and were treated with rufinamide for a mean period of 20 months (range, 12-60 months). Twenty-two of 34 patients (64.5%) who received rufinamide as add-on therapy had a greater than 50% decrease in seizures, and two patients (5.8%) became seizure-free. Four patients (11.7%) had a 25-50% seizure reduction, while seizure frequency remained unchanged in four others (11.7%) and increased in two patients (5.8%). The final mean dosage of rufinamide was 31.5 ± 15.5 mg/kg per day (range, 19-75.4 mg/kg) if combined with valproic acid and of 35.4 ± 11.5 mg/kg per day (range, 8-60.5 mg/kg) without valproic acid. Adverse effects were recorded in nine patients (26.4%). A seizure increase was reported in two of 24 patients (7.3%). Rufinamide may be used as a treatment option in DEE and REP other than LGS.
32341592	Identification of a Novel ACVRL1 Gene Mutation (c.100T>A, p.Cys34Ser) in a Japanese Patient with Possible Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu Disease)	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that causes frequent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Four genes (ENG, ACVRL1, SMAD4, and GDF2) have been identified as pathogenic in HHT. We describe the case of a 50-year-old Japanese man highly suspected of having HHT due to recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and a family history. Genomic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation of c.100T>A, p.Cys34Ser in the patient's ACVRL1 gene. We used 6 freeware programs to perform an in silico analysis of this mutation. The results demonstrated the mutation's high pathogenicity.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

32441821	Reactive bite-related tongue lesions in cognitively impaired epilepsy patients: A report of two cases	Tongue bites frequently occur during seizures in epilepsy patients. We report two cases of cognitively impaired Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients with reactive lesions on the tongues. Case 1 was a 30-year-old man whose chief complaint was mouth pain. Local finding was a small bean-sized pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 45-year-old man whose chief complaint was bleeding from the mouth. His clinical finding was blood loss anemia. Local finding was a 20-mm-diameter pedunculated mass on the tongue, histopathologically diagnosed as pyogenic granuloma. These mass lesions were believed to be reactive, caused by repetitive minor damage involving reparative fibrous tissue response. Therefore, the two cases may have involved reparative responses to mucosal injury incurred by accidental bites during epileptic seizures. Intellectual disability made medical treatment difficult and had allowed the massive lesions to form. It is necessary for cognitively impaired epilepsy patients to undergo regular dental examinations in order to get used to dental checks and to increase the number of intraoral observations in the context of close cooperation between dentists and epilepsy therapists.

32443413	Antifungal Activity of Antimicrobial Peptides and Proteins against Aspergillus fumigatus	Antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) provide an important line of defence against invading microorganisms. However, the activity of AMPs against the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise the anti-Aspergillus activity of specific human AMPs, and to determine whether A. fumigatus can possess resistance to specific AMPs, as a result of in-host adaptation. AMPs were tested against a wide range of clinical isolates of various origins (including cystic fibrosis patients, as well as patients with chronic and acute aspergillosis). We also tested a series of isogenic A. fumigatus isolates obtained from a single patient over a period of 2 years. A range of environmental isolates, obtained from soil in Scotland, was also included. Firstly, the activity of specific peptides was assessed against hyphae using a measure of fungal metabolic activity. Secondly, the activity of specific peptides was assessed against germinating conidia, using imaging flow cytometry as a measure of hyphal growth. We showed that lysozyme and histones inhibited hyphal metabolic activity in all the A. fumigatus isolates tested in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, imaging flow cytometry revealed that histones, β-defensin-1 and lactoferrin inhibited the germination of A. fumigatus conidia.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32457736	ILC2 Lung-Homing in Cystic Fibrosis Patients: Functional Involvement of CCR6 and Impact on Respiratory Failure.	Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from a progressive, often fatal lung disease, which is based on a complex interplay between chronic infections, locally accumulating immune cells and pulmonary tissue remodeling. Although group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) act as crucial initiators of lung inflammation, our understanding of their involvement in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis remains incomplete. Here we report a marked decrease of circulating CCR6+ ILC2s in the blood of cystic fibrosis patients, which significantly correlated with high disease severity and advanced pulmonary failure, strongly implicating increased ILC2 homing from the peripheral blood to the chronically inflamed lung tissue in cystic fibrosis patients. On a functional level, the CCR6 ligand CCL20 was identified as potent promoter of lung-directed ILC2 migration upon inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo using a new humanized mouse model with light-sheet fluorescence microscopic visualization of lung-accumulated human ILC2s. In the lung, blood-derived human ILC2s were able to augment local eosinophil and neutrophil accumulation and induced a marked upregulation of pulmonary type-VI collagen expression. Studies in primary human lung fibroblasts additionally revealed ILC2-derived IL-4 and IL-13 as important mediators of this type-VI collagen-inducing effect. Taken together, the here acquired results suggest that pathologically increased CCL20 levels in cystic fibrosis airways induce CCR6-mediated lung homing of circulating human ILC2s. Subsequent ILC2 activation then triggers local production of type-VI collagen and might thereby drive extracellular matrix remodeling potentially influencing pulmonary tissue destruction in cystic fibrosis patients. Thus, modulating the lung homing capacity of circulating ILC2s and their local effector functions opens new therapeutic avenues for cystic fibrosis treatment.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32467926	GABAA  receptor β3 subunit mutation D120N causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in knock-in mice	The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a devastating early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, associated with severe behavioural abnormalities. Its pathophysiology, however, is largely unknown. A de novo mutation (c.G358A, p.D120N) in the human GABA type-A receptor β3 subunit gene (GABRB3) has been identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. To determine whether the mutation causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in vivo in mice and to elucidate its mechanistic effects, we generated the heterozygous Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse and found that it had frequent spontaneous atypical absence seizures, as well as less frequent tonic, myoclonic, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these seizure types had a unique and characteristic ictal EEG. In addition, knock-in mice displayed abnormal behaviours seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome including impaired learning and memory, hyperactivity, impaired social interactions and increased anxiety. This Gabrb3 mutation did not alter GABA type-A receptor trafficking or expression in knock-in mice. However, cortical neurons in thalamocortical slices from knock-in mice had reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitude and prolonged spontaneous thalamocortical oscillations. Thus, the Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse recapitulated human Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizure types and behavioural abnormalities and was caused by impaired inhibitory GABAergic signalling in the thalamocortical loop. In addition, treatment with antiepileptic drugs and cannabinoids ameliorated atypical absence seizures in knock-in mice. This congenic knock-in mouse demonstrates that a single-point mutation in a single gene can cause development of multiple types of seizures and multiple behavioural abnormalities. The knock-in mouse will be useful for further investigation of the mechanisms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome development and for the development of new antiepileptic drugs and treatments.

32477256	Characterization of Anti-seizure Medication Treatment Pathways in Pediatric Epilepsy Using the Electronic Health Record-Based Common Data Model	The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy using the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record (EHR) data. We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean ± standard deviation: 6.5 ± 3.2 years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.

32496469	Prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in the pediatric population in Mexico: position of a group of experts	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the agent that causes more hospitalizations and deaths due to lower acute respiratory infection. Its distribution is widespread, and almost every child has been infected by the age of two years. Different risk populations have been identified: preterm newborns (NB), children with congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, asthmatics, neuromuscular diseases, among others. However, preterm NBs, children with congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia show higher rates of hospitalization and death from RSV. In the late 90s, monoclonal antibodies against RSV were developed, with demonstrated efficacy and safety for the prevention of RSV hospitalizations in these populations. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this therapy for the prevention of severe infection in the population at higher risk. Economic evaluations have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of immunization, resulting favorable for palivizumab. Immunization in Mexico has resulted cost-effective in NBs under 32 gestation weeks. Mexican authorities should discuss the inclusion of palivizumab in their clinical guidelines.	cystic fibrosis			214	Prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in the pediatric population in Mexico: position of a group of experts.

32496689	News drugs and evolution towards personalized treatment for cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder responsible for the production of a defective transmembrane protein. In recent years, new protein modulators have been developed. They aim to treat the underlying cause of the disease. The results on the biomarkers of the function of the CFTR protein and on the clinical outcomes are very encouraging. However, there is an individual heterogeneity in the response to modulators within a same genotype. Furthermore, clinical trials focus on the most common mutations in the CFTR gene, in particular DF508. Intestinal organoids, a new model of ex vivo study, could offer a quick approach to increase access to effective treatment for all patients with cystic fibrosis regardless of their CFTR genotype.

It was consisting of 2% w/w Capmul MCM C8, 32% w/w Tween 20:Carbitol (2:1) and 66% w/w water. It was characterized for globule size, viscosity, polydispersibility index, zeta potential, pH, conductivity values, transmittance and TEM. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and **brain drug uptake study was carried out using wistar albino rats post intranasal and oral administration**. Topiramate loaded nanoemulsion was having a globule size of 4.73 ± 0.52 nm. It was stable for six months.

32536092	Detection of right-to-left shunt with transthoracic contrast echocardiography in patients with pulmonary hypertension	Objective: To explore the value of right heart contrast echocardiography in etiological diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 74 patients who underwent transthoracic contrast echocardiography in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from May 2015 to July 2018, all of whom were diagnosed as PH by right heart catheterization. Patients were divided into three groups according to contrast echocardiography: the intra-cardiac shunt group (<4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); Intrapulmonary shunt group (>4 cardiac cycles with microbubbles in the left heart); non-shunt group. The etiology, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PO(2)), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central nervous system complications were also compared among the three groups. Results: Among the 74 patients, right-to-left shunt was found in 28 cases (37.8%) by contrast echocardiography, including 11 cases (14.9%) of intra-cardiac shunt and 17 cases (23.0%) of intrapulmonary shunt. In the 11 cases of intra-cardiac shunt, 7 were diagnosed with congenital heart disease and 4 were patent foramen. Two with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and 1 with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were included in the 16 cases of intrapulmonary shunt. There was no statistical difference in PO(2), mPAP, PVR, NT-proBNP, RAP, CO and functional class among the three groups (all P>0.05). A total of 5 cases (6.8%) were found with nervous system comorbidities, 4 cases (5.4%) with cerebral infarction and 1 cases epilepsy, and 2 cases of cerebral infarction were diagnosed as paradoxical embolism. Nervous system complications were more common in patients with intra-cardiac shunt than in other groups. Conclusion: While right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echocardiography has no relationship with disease severity, it has complementary value in the etiological diagnosis of PH, and intra-cardiac shunt may increase the risk of nervous system complications.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

32538908	Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization in Zebrafish Embryos and Tube Formation Assay in iPSC-ECs to Study the Role of Endoglin in Vascular Development	Vascular development is determined by the sequential expression of specific genes, which can be studied by performing in situ hybridization assays in zebrafish during different developmental stages. To investigate the role of endoglin(eng) in vessel formation during the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), morpholino-mediated targeted knockdown of eng in zebrafish are used to study its temporal expression and associated functions. Here, whole-mount in situ RNA hybridization (WISH) is employed for the analysis of eng and its downstream genes in zebrafish embryos. Also, tube formation assays are performed in HHT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs; with eng mutations). A specific signal amplifying system using the whole amount In Situ Hybridization - WISH provides higher resolution and lower background results compared to traditional methods. To obtain a better signal, the post-fixation time is adjusted to 30 min after probe hybridization. Because fluorescence staining is not sensitive in zebrafish embryos, it is replaced with diaminobezidine (DAB) staining here. In this protocol, HHT patient-derived iPSC lines containing an eng mutation are differentiated into endothelial cells. After coating a plate with basement membrane matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, iPSC-ECs are seeded as a monolayer into wells and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the tube length and number of branches are calculated using microscopic images. Thus, with this improved WISH protocol, it is shown that reduced eng expression affects endothelial progenitor formation in zebrafish embryos. This is further confirmed by tube formation assays using iPSC-ECs derived from a patient with HHT. These assays confirm the role for eng in early vascular development.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

32540806	Comparing effects of low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet and high-fat, high-calorie diet on cytokine levels of patients with cystic fibrosis: A randomized controlled clinical trial	The importance of the host inflammatory response, as a central pathological feature of cystic fibrosis, is well recognized. Additionally, hyperglycemia can induce an immune response and consecutively may exacerbate symptoms of this disease. Hence, adherence to a low glycemic index diet, through normalizing blood glucose levels, may reduce inflammation in patients with this disease. This study aimed to compare effects of a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet and routine high-fat, high-calorie diet on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with cystic fibrosis. In this randomized clinical trial, 44 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive for three months either a high-fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet (n = 22) with similar calorie and macronutrients composition to the control diet. Patients in first arm were allowed to use all sources of carbohydrates with different glycemic indices, whereas those in another arm consumed carbohydrates from low glycemic index sources. Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17A, and IFNγ, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured at baseline and after the end of the trial. There were significant differences between groups for IL-6 (P = 0.02) and IL-17 (P = 0.01), in favor of the low glycemic diet, but no between-group differences were detected in IL-10 and IFN-γ. Although serum levels of IL-17 were reduced in both the groups as compared with the baseline values, this reduction was only significant in the group assigned to the low glycemic diet (P= 0.007), In addition, IL-6 serum levels decreased and those of IL-10 increased significantly as compared with the baseline values in the low glycemic diet (P= 0.01). It seems that adherence to a low glycemic index/high-fat, high-calorie diet for three months can improve some inflammatory biomarkers in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis compared with the high-fat, high-calorie diet.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

Following these changes, the popularity of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) dietary supplements by consumers has greatly exceeded the scientific understanding of purported benefits, safety and composition of these botanical extracts. Further complicating CBD hemp supplement regulation, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers CBD to be an approved drug (Epidiolex) in the treatment of severe epilepsy disorders, Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. At the same time, hemp-derived CBD supplements can contain a complex phytochemical matrix from the hemp plant, distinguishing the composition of these products from isolated CBD preparations. This work aims to provide clarity on differentiating botanical full-spectrum hemp extracts containing CBD from isolates, from a phytochemical, toxicological and regulatory perspective.

32544421	Improving the dissolution of a water-insoluble orphan drug through a fused deposition modelling 3-Dimensional printing technology approach	Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a rare form of childhood epilepsy. Rufinamide is an orphan drug indicated for the treatment of LGS. Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) is a process in which solid objects are created based on a digital file by adding materials layer by layer. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a 3DP technique with the advantages of solid dispersion systems and the ability to use various pharmaceutical excipients in small scales, which makes this technology favorable for the production of orphan drugs. Rufinamide is a water-insoluble lipophilic compound which can exist in different polymorphic forms. The therapeutic dose is 3200 mg/day, at which rufinamide exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, which may be attributed to its limited solubility. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the dissolution of rufinamide through the use of 3DP technology. For this purpose, optimum 3DP tablets were developed based on 3DP manufacturability and dissolution behaviors. The findings suggest that a mixture of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), Soluplus®, Kollidon® VA64, Gelucire® 48/16 and Triacetin are suitable excipients for FDM-3DP technology that can improve the dissolution of rufinamide. The optimum 3DP tablet shows significantly higher dissolution than Inovelon® at the therapeutic dose due to its improved wdissolution.

We report a case of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative cutaneous vasculitis in a 15-year-old female CF patient in tandem with infection and subsequent colonization by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). The flares of cutaneous vasculitis is associated closely with an infective exacerbation of CF and improved upon treatment of the infective exacerbation.

32583228	Management and outcomes of Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteremia in patients without cystic fibrosis: a retrospective observational study.	Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is an emerging pathogen of nosocomial infection in chronic or critically ill patients without cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective was to evaluate the management and outcomes of BCC bacteremia in patients without CF. We conducted a retrospective study of non-CF adult patients with BCC bacteremia between January 1997 and December 2016 at 4 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. A total of 216 non-CF patients with BCC bacteremia were identified. Most cases were hospital-acquired (79.2%), and the most common source was a central venous catheter (CVC) (42.1%). The rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and piperacillin-tazobactam of BCC isolates were high as 92.8% and 90.3%, respectively. The rates of susceptibility to ceftazidime, meropenem, and levofloxacin were 75.5%, 72.3%, and 64.1%, respectively. The 14-day, 30-day, and in-hospital mortality rate was 19.4%, 23.1%, and 31.0%, respectively. Female (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-6.8), liver cirrhosis (OR = 6.2; 95% CI, 1.6-16.6), septic shock (OR = 11.2; 95% CI, 5.1-24.8), and catheter-related infection (OR = 2.6, 95% CI, 1.2-5.8) were the independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. The outcome did not differ according to type of antibiotics used. Among 91 patients with CVC-related BCC bacteremia, delayed CVC removal (> 3 days) had a higher rate of persistent bacteremia (54.5 vs. 26.1%; P = 0.03) and lower rate of clinical response (49.0 vs. 71.9%; P = 0.04), compared with early CVC removal (within 3 days). BCC bacteremia occurring in non-CF patients was mostly hospital-acquired and CVC-related. Early removal of the catheter is crucial in treatment of CVC-related BCC bacteremia.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

32614070	Thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients on concurrent cannabidiol and valproic acid.	In January 2019, a new plant-derived purified cannabidiol preparation, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, became commercially available for patients ≥2 years old with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. Among our patients who were prescribed the new cannabidiol formulation, we observed several cases of thrombocytopenia and therefore embarked on this study. We conducted a single-center systematic chart review of all pediatric patients (<21 years old) who were prescribed cannabidiol from January to August 2019. We evaluated salient features of the patients' epilepsy syndrome, age, concurrent medications, and surveillance laboratory results before and after cannabidiol initiation. Among 87 patients, nine (10%) developed thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir range = 17 000-108 000) following initiation of cannabidiol. Each of these nine children was on combination therapy of cannabidiol with valproic acid. Whereas no children on cannabidiol without valproic acid (0/57) developed thrombocytopenia, nine of 23 treated with combination valproic acid and cannabidiol developed platelets < 110 000/µL (P < .0001). We report a novel and clinically important side effect of thrombocytopenia in one-third of patients treated concurrently with cannabidiol and valproic acid. If this finding is confirmed, clinicians should perform close monitoring for thrombocytopenia when adding cannabidiol to a regimen that includes valproic acid.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

32615417	Vagus nerve stimulation in patients with therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy.	For patients with generalized epilepsy who do not respond to antiseizure medications, the therapeutic options are limited. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a treatment mainly approved for therapy-resistant focal epilepsy. There is limited information on the use of VNS on generalized epilepsies, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). We identified patients with a diagnosis of generalized epilepsy (including LGS and GGE), who underwent VNS implantation at the London Health Sciences Centre and Western University, London, Ontario, since this treatment became available in Canada in 1997 until July 2018. We assessed response to the treatment, including admissions to hospital and complications. A total of 46 patients were included in this study with a history of therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy. The mean age at implantation was 24 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 17.8-31 years), significantly younger in the LGS group (p = 0.02) and 50% (n = 23) were female. The most common etiologies were GGE in 37% (n = 17) and LGS in 63% (n = 29). Median follow-up since VNS implantation was 63 months (IQR: 31-112.8 months). Of the LGS group 41.7% (n = 12) of patients had an overall seizure reduction of 50% or more, and 64.7% (n = 11) in the GGE group without statistical significance between the groups. The best response in seizure reduction was seen in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with a significant reduction in the GGE group (p = 0.043). There was a reduction of seizure-related hospital admissions from 91.3% (N = 42) preimplantation, to 43.5% (N = 20) postimplantation (p < 0.05). The frequency of side effects due to the stimulation was almost equal in both groups (62.1% in LGS and 64.7% in GGE). Vagus nerve stimulation should be considered as a treatment in patients with therapy-resistant generalized epilepsy, especially in cases with GGE.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

32657695	Medical cannabis: What practitioners need to know	The South African (SA) Constitutional Court recently decriminalised the private cultivation, possession and use of cannabis by adults. Cannabis contains varying amounts of the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), depending on various cultivation factors. No commercial plant-derived cannabis products are currently registered by the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) for medical use. Such products are therefore unregulated, but are freely available in SA, and may be of inadequate quality and unverified composition, and not guaranteed to be safe or effective. SAHPRA has to date approved only one synthetic medical cannabis product, dronabinol. Evidence supporting benefit from medical cannabis exists for two drug-resistant childhood forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Adjuvant therapy with medical cannabis can reduce seizure frequency for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome by 18.8% and 22.8%, respectively, and may be beneficial for other rare forms of epilepsy. There is moderate evidence for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with the synthetic cannabinoids. Multiple sclerosis-associated spasticity showed a small clinical improvement in self-reported spasticity when a purified form of THC/CBD was added to existing therapy. Currently, low-level or no convincing evidence exists for the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain, sleep and weight disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Cannabis is associated with a greater risk of adverse effects than active and placebo controls, and may be involved in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. The evolving regulatory and legal landscape on the use of medical cannabis will guide prescription and recreational use in the coming years.

32673237	Users' Experiences of a Mobile Health Self-Management Approach for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: Mixed Methods Study.	Despite a large number of clinical trials aiming at evaluating the digital self-management of chronic diseases, there is little discussion about users' experiences with digital approaches. However, a good user experience is a critical factor for technology adoption. Understanding users' experiences can inform the design of approaches toward increased motivation for digital self-management. This study aimed to evaluate the self-management of cystic fibrosis (CF) with a focus on gastrointestinal concerns and the care of young patients. Following a user-centered design approach, we developed a self-management app for patients and parents and a web tool for health care professionals (HCPs). To evaluate the proposed solutions, a 6-month clinical trial was conducted in 6 European CF competence centers. This paper analyzes the user acceptance of the technology and the benefits and disadvantages perceived by the trial participants. A mixed methods approach was applied. Data were collected through 41 semistructured qualitative interviews of patients, parents, and HCPs involved in the clinical trial. In addition, data were collected through questionnaires embedded in the self-management app. Support for enzyme dose calculation and nutrition management was found to be particularly useful. Patients and parents rapidly strengthened their knowledge about the treatment and increased their self-efficacy. Reported benefits include reduced occurrence of symptoms and enhanced quality of life. Patients and parents had different skills, requiring follow-up by HCPs in an introductory phase. HCPs valued obtaining precise information about the patients, allowing for more personalized advice. However, the tight follow-up of several patients led to an increased workload. Over time, as patient self-efficacy increased, patient motivation for using the app decreased and the quality of the reported data was reduced. Self-management enfolds a collaboration between patients and HCPs. To be successful, a self-management approach should be accepted by both parties. Through understanding behaviors and experiences, this study defines recommendations for a complex case-the demanding treatment of CF. We identify target patient groups and situations for which the app is most beneficial and suggest focusing on these rather than motivating for regular app usage over a long time. We also advise the personalized supervision of patients during the introduction of the approach. Finally, we propose to develop guidance for HCPs to facilitate changes in practice. As personalization and technology literacy are factors found to influence the acceptance of digital self-management of other chronic diseases, it is relevant to consider the proposed recommendations beyond the case of CF.	cystic fibrosis			464	... evaluate the self-management of cystic fibrosis (CF) with a focus on gastrointestinal concerns and the care of young patients.

32715412	Cost-Effectiveness of Cannabidiol Adjunct Therapy versus Usual Care for the Treatment of Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.	Cannabidiol (CBD) is a novel therapy for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a rare, treatment-refractory epileptic encephalopathy. Two pivotal trials found CBD 20 mg/kg/day conferred a reduction from baseline in median drop seizure frequency of 44% and 42%, respectively, compared with 22% and 17%, respectively, in the usual care arms. No economic evaluations have been published to date. This analysis assessed the cost effectiveness of CBD adjunct therapy compared with usual care alone in LGS from the US payer perspective. We developed a lifetime horizon Markov decision analytic model. Efficacy, healthcare costs (2020 US$), and health state utilities were ascertained from published clinical trials, retrospective analyses, and time trade-off interviews conducted in the UK, respectively. Fifteen-year-old patients entering the model transitioned to states representing a percentage reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline, where they remained until reverting back to baseline drop seizure frequency, or death. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter uncertainty, and scenario analyses investigated the impact of various assumptions. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Compared with usual care alone, CBD yielded 0.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $314,900 additional healthcare expenditure, resulting in $451,800 per QALY. Uncertainty in health state utilities were the largest contributor to uncertainty in the results. Results from the 5000-simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance of CBD being cost effective at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, with a 95% credible range for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $325,300-$690,000 per QALY. CBD does not appear to be a cost-effective therapeutic option in LGS patients at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.

32718529	Cerebrovascular Malformations in a Pediatric Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Cohort	We determined the frequency of cerebrovascular malformations in a pediatric cohort with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Retrospective cohort study of 54 children diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at a tertiary care center. All neuroimaging was reviewed to assess for number and types of cerebrovascular malformations and for intracerebral hemorrhage and arterial ischemic stroke. Clinical charts were reviewed for clinical manifestations, genetic mutation, and clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhages and arterial ischemic strokes. Among 54 children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a median age of 3.5 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 7.9 years) at diagnosis, neuroimaging was performed in 52 (96.3%) at a median age of 5.2 years (interquartile range 1.8 to 9 years). Fourteen of 52 imaged children (26.9%) had cerebrovascular malformations. Cerebrovascular malformations included arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, vein of Galen malformations, and developmental venous anomalies. Six of the 14 children with cerebrovascular malformations (42.9%) had multiple malformations. Three children developed new cerebral arteriovenous malformations over time. Six children (11.1%) had clinically evident intracerebral hemorrhage, arterial ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The three children with intracerebral hemorrhage presented at young ages (4.3 to 7.7 years). More than a quarter of children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who were imaged had cerebrovascular malformations, and overt stroke occurred in more than 10%. Intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in pediatric hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients at young ages, and new cerebral arteriovenous malformations may develop over time. Early screening with neuroimaging including neurovascular imaging as well as repeat neuroimaging may be warranted in children with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

32723034	Deciphering the vascular labyrinth: role of microRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in brain AVM development - literature review	"Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a relatively infrequent vascular pathology of unknown etiology that, despite their rarity, cause the highest number of hemorrhagic strokes under the age of 30 years. They pose a challenge to all forms of treatment due to their variable morphology, location, size, and, last but not least, evolving nature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA strands that may suppress the expression of target genes by binding completely or partially to their complementary sequences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the name implies, are variations in a single nucleotide in the DNA, usually found in the non-coding segments. Although the majority of SNPs are harmless, some located in the proximity of candidate genes may result in altered expression or function of these genes and cause diseases or affect how different pathologies react to treatment. The roles miRNAs and certain SNPs play in the development and growth of AVMs are currently uncertain, yet progress in deciphering the minutiae of this pathology is already visible. We performed an electronic Medline (PubMed, PubMed Central) and Google Academic exploration using permutations of the terms: ""arteriovenous malformations,"" ""single nucleotide polymorphisms,"" ""microRNA,"" ""non-coding RNA,"" and ""genetic mutations."" The findings were then divided into two categories, namely the miRNAs and the candidate gene SNPs associated with AVMs respectively. 6 miRNAs and 12 candidate gene SNPs were identified and discussed. The following literature review focuses on the discoveries made in ascertaining the different implications of miRNAs and candidate gene SNPs in the formation and evolution of brain AVMs, as well as highlighting the possible directions of future research and biological treatment.

32762495	Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

32777524	Mutation analysis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in Chinese congenital absence of vas deferens patients	To find the variant spectrum of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, and evaluate its frequent variants in Chinese congenital absence of vas deferens (CAVD) patients. A total of 276 patients with azoospermia and CAVD (aged from 21 to 44 years old) were investigated from May 2013 to September 2019 in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Additionally, 50 healthy, unrelated volunteers were recruited as controls (aged from 21 to 46 years old). The 5'-UTR, exons and their flanking side of the CFTR gene were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results were compared with those retrieved from the Ensembl Genome Browser. In addition, all 13 novel variants were further confirmed independently by Sanger sequencing and evaluated in the bioinformatics web servers. A schematic of the variant spectrum of the CFTR gene, including 13 novel variants (12 in CAVD patients, one in the control group), is shown, and the frequent variants in Chinese CAVD patients were 5 T (27.54%), c.-8G > C (7.25%), p.Q1352H (5.98%), and p.I556V (3.08%). 5 T was found to be the most frequent variant. p.Q1352H had a significantly high allelic frequency in CAVD patients (P < 0.05). c.-8G > C and p.I556V had high allelic frequencies but showed no difference between patients and controls (P > 0.05). p.Q1352H is the most common and important missense variant in Chinese patients with CAVD, while the pathological effects of C.-8G > C and p.I556V may be weak after evaluation.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32800486	Decreased survival in cystic fibrosis patients with a positive screen for depression.	The International Depression Epidemiological Study (TIDES) found elevated rates of screen positivity for depression and anxiety among individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Depression is associated with worse adherence and health-related quality of life in CF. We investigated the relationship with mortality. Subjects were untransplanted participants in TIDES 12+ years of age receiving care at one of 45 collaborating US CF care centers who completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and/or Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale during a stable visit between 2006 and 2010. Clinical characteristics and mortality data were obtained from the CF Foundation Patient Registry. The association of a positive screen with 5-year survival was evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards modeling. Of 1005 eligible patients, 25% screened positive for depression and 34% screened positive for anxiety. Patients who screened positive for depression were more likely to be older, have a residual function mutation, public insurance, and more pulmonary exacerbations in the screening year. There were 96 deaths. The unadjusted 5-year Hazard Ratio (HR) for death among those with depression was 2.0; 95% CI (1.3, 3.0)]. When adjusted for predetermined potential confounders the HR for the entire population was 1.4; 95% CI (0.9, 2.2). The adjusted HR was higher in adults [1.6; 95% CI (1.0, 2.4)] and those screening in the severe range [2.0; 95% CI (1.2, 3.4)]. Anxiety was not associated with mortality. A positive depression screen is associated with increased mortality among adults with CF. Research into the etiology of this relationship is needed.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32802823	Effect of hypertonic saline on mucociliary clearance and clinical outcomes in chronic bronchitis	Mucus dehydration and impaired mucus clearance are common features of cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In CF, inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) improves lung function and produces sustained increases in mucociliary clearance (MCC). We hypothesised that administration of HS (7% NaCl) twice daily for 2 weeks would improve clinical outcomes and produce sustained increases in MCC in COPD subjects with a chronic bronchitis (CB) phenotype. Twenty-two CB subjects completed a double-blinded, crossover study comparing inhaled HS to a hypotonic control solution (0.12% saline) administered via nebuliser twice daily for 2 weeks. Treatment order was randomised. During each treatment period, symptoms and spirometry were measured. MCC was measured at baseline, shortly after initial study agent administration, and approximately 12 h after the final dose. HS was safe and well tolerated but overall produced no significant improvements in spirometry or patient-reported outcomes. CB subjects had slower baseline MCC than healthy subjects. The MCC rates over 60 min (Ave60Clr) in CB subjects following 2 weeks of HS were not different from 0.12% saline but were slower than baseline (Ave60Clr was 9.1±6.3% at baseline versus 5.3±6.9% after HS; p<0.05). Subgroup analyses determined that subjects with residual baseline central lung clearance (14 subjects) had improved spirometry and symptoms following treatment with HS, but not 0.12% saline, treatment. Inhaled HS appeared to be safe in a general CB population. A specific phenotypic subgroup may benefit from HS but requires additional study.	cystic fibrosis	3.4.

32811866	ENaC regulation by phospholipids and DGK explained through mathematical modeling	Cystic fibrosis is a condition caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It is also thought to increase the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The altered function of these ion channels is one of the causes of the thick dehydrated mucus that characterizes the disease and is partially responsible for recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation events that ultimately destroy the lungs of affected subjects. Phosphoinositides are signaling lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes and membrane proteins, including ENaC. Inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an enzyme of the phosphoinositide pathway, reduces ENaC function. We propose a computational analysis that is based on the combination of two existing mathematical models: one representing the dynamics of phosphoinositides and the other explaining how phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) influences ENaC activity and, consequently, airway surface liquid. This integrated model permits, for the first time, a detailed assessment of the intricate interactions between DGK and ENaC and is consistent with available literature data. In particular, the computational approach allows comparisons of two competing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ENaC. The results strongly suggest that the regulation of ENaC is primarily exerted through the control of PI(4,5)P2 production by type-I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KI), which in turn is controlled by phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of the DGK reaction.	cystic fibrosis	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		256	ENaC regulation by phospholipids and DGK explained through mathematical modeling. Cystic fibrosis is a condition caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It is also thought to increase the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The altered function of these ion channels is one of the causes of the thick dehydrated mucus that characterizes the disease and is partially responsible for recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation events that ultimately destroy the lungs of affected subjects. Phosphoinositides are signaling lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes and membrane proteins, including ENaC. Inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an enzyme of the phosphoinositide pathway, reduces ENaC function. We propose a computational analysis that is based on the combination of two existing mathematical models: one representing the dynamics of phosphoinositides and the other explaining how phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) influences ENaC activity and, consequently, airway surface liquid. This integrated model permits, for the first time, a detailed assessment of the intricate interactions between DGK and ENaC and is consistent with available literature data. In particular, the computational approach allows comparisons of two competing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ENaC.

32819967	Extracellular Vesicles from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Suppress MHC-Related Molecules in Human Lung Macrophages.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most common pathogens colonizing the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain LPS and other virulence factors that modulate the host's innate immune response, leading to an increased local proinflammatory response and reduced pathogen clearance, resulting in chronic infection and ultimately poor patient outcomes. Lung macrophages are the first line of defense in the airway innate immune response to pathogens. Proper host response to bacterial infection requires communication between APC and T cells, ultimately leading to pathogen clearance. **In this study, we investigate whether EVs secreted from P. aeruginosa alter MHC Ag expression in lung macrophages, thereby potentially contributing to decreased pathogen clearance**. Primary lung macrophages from human subjects were collected via bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to EVs isolated from P. aeruginosa in vitro. Gene expression was measured with the NanoString nCounter gene expression assay. DNA methylation was measured with the EPIC array platform to assess changes in methylation. P. aeruginosa EVs suppress the expression of 11 different MHC-associated molecules in lung macrophages. Additionally, we show reduced DNA methylation in a regulatory region of gene complement factor B (CFB) as the possible driving mechanism of widespread MHC gene suppression. Our results demonstrate MHC molecule downregulation by P. aeruginosa-derived EVs in lung macrophages, which is consistent with an immune evasion strategy employed by a prokaryote in a host-pathogen interaction, potentially leading to decreased pulmonary bacterial clearance.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32827745	Completion Corpus Callosotomy with Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Drug-Resistant, Intractable Epilepsy.	Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a noninvasive technique for division of the corpus callosum, which can confer improved seizure control to patients suffering from frequent atonic seizures due to rapid interhemispheric generalization. This noninvasive approach is well-suited for use in a palliative intervention for improved seizure control in this patient population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of radiosurgical completion corpus callosotomy in an adult in the United States. A 20-year-old ambidextrous nonverbal man with a history of refractory generalized epilepsy status post open anterior corpus callosotomy at age 10 years, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and autism presented after 2 years of incremental, progressive deterioration in seizure control and behavior including 1 year. The family decided to pursue SRS corpus callosotomy. Under general anesthesia, a volume of interest encompassing a full midsagittal plane of the corpus callosum was defined to deliver 60 Gy to the 50% isodose line fully encompassing the target. Gamma Knife was used with 2 isocenters at 90° and 1 at 110° and isodose lines of 60, 20, and 12 Gy. Treatment was carried out without difficulty or complications while the patient remained under close monitoring. The patient was discharged the next day with a 2-week taper of dexamethasone. Eight months postradiosurgical corpus callosotomy, the patient is free of atonic seizures and is ambulatory. In carefully selected cases and with protective radiosurgical planning, SRS for completion corpus callosotomy represents an effective option for refractory seizure control.

32841519	Physical exercise as a tool to minimize the consequences of the Covid-19 quarantine: An overview for cystic fibrosis	Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak leading to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has become a global pandemic. Patients with Cystic fibrosis are considered of major risk, as respiratory tract infections are more severe than in the general population, with a higher risk of complications and a negative impact on lung function. The performance of physical exercise is considered as key for its well-known general benefits and also as a complementary method to help airway clearance. Therefore, physical exercise is also considered as key in the therapeutic strategy during the quarantine period. However, the impossibility to perform exercise with appropriate prescription and monitoring is of considerable worry to health care professionals. Thus, alternative strategies, such as online measures to monitor this therapy and, consequently, to achieve a safe and effective dose are highly needed. Exercise regimens should include strength and endurance, as well as balance and flexibility exercises. Patients are highly encouraged to participate in exercise programs to maintain fitness and exercise should be continued during the quarantine period. This commentary provides a summary of the main effects and benefits of physical exercise, as well as the main recommendations for its adequate execution, including exercise modality, frequency, intensity, and volume.	cystic fibrosis			243	Physical exercise as a tool to minimize the consequences of the Covid-19 quarantine: An overview for cystic fibrosis.

32841845	Sleep-disordered breathing in cystic fibrosis	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, genetic disease that affects approximately 30,000 Americans. Although patients frequently report snoring, mouth breathing, and insomnia, the extent to which sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may underlie these complaints remains unknown. Single-center retrospective review of polysomnography results from referred patients with and without CF individually-matched (1:2) for age, gender, race, and body mass index (BMI). Mean ages were 8.0 ± 5.2 (sd) and 35.9 ± 12.9 years, among 29 children and 23 adults with CF respectively. The CF and non-CF groups were well-matched in age and BMI. Subjects with vs. without CF had three times greater odds of moderate-severe SDB (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5 in children, ≥ 15 in adults) (p = 0.01). Nocturnal oxygen saturation nadir (Minimum SpO2) was lower among CF vs. non-CF groups (p = 0.002). For every 1-unit increase in AHI, the decline in Minimum SpO2 was larger for subjects with vs. without CF (p = 0.05). In subjects with CF, forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted (FEV1 PPD) was associated with Minimum SpO2 (Pearson r = 0.68, p < 0.0001) but not AHI (r = -0.19, p = 0.27). For every 1-unit increase in AHI, magnitude of decline in Minimum SpO2 was larger for those with low vs. normal FEV1 PPD (p = 0.01). Severity of SDB may be worse among referred patients with vs. without CF. The SDB may modify the relationship between CF lung disease and nocturnal hypoxemia. Markers of lung disease severity including lung function do not predict SDB severity, suggesting the need for routine polysomnography to screen for this sleep disorder.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32851114	Drug-Drug Interactions Between Cannabidiol and Lithium	Epidiolex® (Cannabidiol- CBD) is approved for epilepsy associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients over 2 years of age. Common side effects include somnolence and diarrhea. Recent studies have demonstrated interactions between cannabidiol and several other antiseizure medications. However, little is known regarding interactions between cannabidiol and other classes of medications. We discuss an autistic patient with LGS and significant psychiatric comorbidities who was being treated with multiple antiseizure and psychiatric medications, including lithium, when CBD was added to his medical regimen. Several weeks after initiating CBD therapy, he developed hypersomnolence, ataxia and decreased oral intake and was found to have lithium toxicity. Lithium was discontinued and his symptoms resolved. He remains on CBD and 2 other antiseizure medications, seizure-free with improved behavior. We review mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics of CBD and discuss possible explanations for lithium toxicity in this patient.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.3.

32854045	Electroclinical pattern in the transition from West to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	**The aim of this study was to analyze electroclinical features of a group of patients with West syndrome (WS) who subsequently developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) during the transition between both syndromes. A retrospective and descriptive study **was conducted of a series of patients diagnosed with WS who developed LGS seen at Hospital de Pediatría Prof. Dr. JP Garrahan between January 2012 and January 2019. The medical charts of 170 patients with WS were analyzed. In 63 (37 %) of the children WS evolved to LGS. During the transition from WS to LGS four well-defined electroclinical patterns were recognized. The first corresponded to a group of patients with multiple seizure types, including epileptic spasms associated with multifocal paroxysms; the electroclinical pattern in second group showed mainly focal seizures associated with focal discharges in the EEG; the third group showed predominance of epileptic spasms and myoclonic seizures associated with diffuse spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave paroxysms; and the remaining group was characterized by a mixed electroclinical pattern including features of the other three groups. All patients had a neuropsychological deficit. Worsening of cognition and behavior was observed during the transition period in 11, 8, and 5 patients of groups 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Our study of the transition period from WS to LGS allowed us to recognize four well-defined electroclinical patterns. The early recognition of the different patterns could, in the future, support a more precocious prognostic evaluation.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	1.1.

32873215	Interferon-gamma-activated macrophages infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia process and present bacterial antigens to T-cells by class I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules.	Burkholderia cenocepacia is an emerging opportunistic pathogen for people with cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease. Intracellular survival in macrophages within a membrane-bound vacuole (BcCV) that delays acidification and maturation into lysosomes is a hallmark of B. cenocepacia infection. Intracellular B. cenocepacia induce an inflammatory response leading to macrophage cell death by pyroptosis through the secretion of a bacterial deamidase that results in the activation of the pyrin inflammasome. However, how or whether infected macrophages can process and present B. cenocepacia antigens to activate T-cells has not been explored. Engulfed bacterial protein antigens are cleaved into small peptides in the late endosomal major histocompatibility class II complex (MHC) compartment (MIIC). Here, we demonstrate that BcCVs and MIICs have overlapping features and that interferon-gamma-activated macrophages infected with B. cenocepacia can process bacterial antigens for presentation by class II MHC molecules to CD4+ T-cells and by class I MHC molecules to CD8+ T-cells. Infected macrophages also release processed bacterial peptides into the extracellular medium, stabilizing empty class I MHC molecules of bystander cells. Together, we conclude that BcCVs acquire MIIC characteristics, supporting the notion that macrophages infected with B. cenocepacia contribute to establishing an adaptive immune response against the pathogen.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

Anoctamin1 (ANO1), a calcium-activated chloride channel, is frequently overexpressed in several cancers, including human prostate cancer and oral squamous cell carcinomas. ANO1 plays a critical role in tumor growth and maintenance of these cancers. In this study, we have isolated two new compounds (1 and 2) and four known compounds (3-6) from Mallotus apelta. These compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on ANO1 channel activity and their cytotoxic effects on PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, compounds 1 and 2 significantly reduced both ANO1 channel activity and cell viability. Electrophysiological study revealed that compound 2 (Ani-D2) is a potent and selective ANO1 inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 2.64 μM. Ani-D2 had minimal effect on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel activity and intracellular calcium signaling. Notably, Ani-D2 significantly reduced ANO1 protein expression levels and cell viability in an ANO1-dependent manner in PC-3 and oral squamous cell carcinoma CAL-27 cells. In addition, Ani-D2 strongly reduced cell migration and induced activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 and CAL-27 cells. This study revealed that a novel ANO1 inhibitor, Ani-D2, has therapeutic potential for the treatment of several cancers that overexpress ANO1, such as prostate cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32900780	How can we relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis? An international qualitative survey	Relieving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was identified as a 'top ten' priority by our James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership in cystic fibrosis (CF). We conducted an online survey to find out more about the effect of GI symptoms in CF. We co-produced an online survey distributed to the CF community via web-based platforms. The survey consisted of open and closed questions designed to help us learn more about the effects of GI symptoms for people with CF (pwCF). We analysed the data using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. We promoted the survey via social media and web-based platforms which allowed respondents from any country to take part. Our participants came from the CF community, including: adults and children with CF, parents and close family of pwCF and healthcare professionals (HCPs) working with pwCF. There were 276 respondents: 90 (33%) pwCF, 79 (29%) family, 107 (39%) HCPs. The most commonly reported symptoms by lay respondents were stomach cramps/pain, bloating and a 'combination of symptoms'. The top three symptoms that HCPs said were reported to them were reduced appetite, bloating and constipation. Almost all (94% (85/90)) HCPs thought medications helped to relieve GI symptoms but only 58% (82/141) of lay respondents agreed. Our survey has shown that GI symptoms among our participants are prevalent and intrude on daily lives of pwCF. There is a need for well-designed clinical studies to provide better evidence for management of GI symptoms and complications.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32923987	Pendrin stimulates a chloride absorption pathway to increase CFTR-mediated chloride secretion from Cystic Fibrosis airway epithelia	Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an inherited multi-system disease, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that disrupt its ability to secrete anions from epithelia. Recovery of functional anion secretion may be curative for CF, so different components of the ion transport machinery have become attractive therapeutic targets. Several members of the SLC26 ion transporter family have been linked to epithelial ion flux, some through putative functional interactions with CFTR. Using a small-scale qPCR screen, we confirmed that the anion transporter SLC26A4 (pendrin) is downregulated in CF. Upregulation of pendrin using interleukins IL-4 or IL-13 increased Cl- secretion through CFTR in human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) derived epithelia differentiated in vitro and measured in the Ussing Chamber. Inhibition or knockdown of pendrin prevented this increased secretion. Increased CFTR activity was not driven by increases in CFTR protein or upstream regulatory pathway components. When basolateral Cl- absorption through NKCC1 was inhibited, a pendrin-dependent Cl- absorption pathway allowing CFTR to continue secreting Cl- from the epithelium was revealed. Although CFTR is often considered the bottleneck in the transepithelial Cl- transport pathway, these studies indicate that basolateral Cl- permeability becomes limiting as CFTR activity increases. Therefore, an increase of epithelial Cl- absorption via pendrin might have additional therapeutic benefit in combination with CFTR modulators.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

32928027	Boricua Founder Variant in FRRS1L  Causes Epileptic Encephalopathy With Hyperkinetic Movements	To describe a founder mutation effect and the clinical phenotype of homozygous FRRS1L c.737\_739delGAG (p.Gly246del) variant in 15 children of Puerto Rican (Boricua) ancestry presenting with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE-37) with prominent movement disorder. EIEE-37 is caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the FRRS1L gene, which is critical for AMPA-receptor function, resulting in intractable epilepsy and dyskinesia. A retrospective, multicenter chart review of patients sharing the same homozygous FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant identified by clinical genetic testing. Clinical information was collected regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes, neuroimaging, electrographic features and clinical response to antiseizure medications. Fifteen patients from 12 different families of Puerto Rican ancestry were homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) pathogenic variant, with ages ranging from 1 to 25 years. The onset of seizures was from 6 to 24 months. All had hypotonia, severe global developmental delay, and most had hyperkinetic involuntary movements. Developmental regression during the first year of life was common (86%). Electroencephalogram showed hypsarrhythmia in 66% (10/15), with many older children evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Six patients demonstrated progressive volume loss and/or cerebellar atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We describe the largest cohort to date of patients with epileptic encephalopathy. We estimate that 0.76% of unaffected individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry carry this pathogenic variant due to a founder effect. Children homozygous for the FRRS1L (p.Gly246del) Boricua variant exhibit a very homogenous phenotype of early developmental regression and epilepsy, starting with infantile spasms and evolving into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with hyperkinetic movement disorder.

32945607	A novel GABRB3 variant in Dravet syndrome: Case report and literature review	Mutations in GABRB3 have been identified in subjects with different types of epilepsy and epileptic syndromes, including West syndrome (WS), Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (MAE), and others. We herewith report on a girl affected by DS, who has been followed from infancy to the current age of 18 years. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic testing for multigene analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders identified two likely de novo pathogenic mutations, a missense variant in GABRB3 gene (c.842 C>T; p.Thr281IIe) and a nonsense variant found in BBS4 gene (c.883 C>T; p.Arg295Ter). A likely relationship between the novel GABRB3 gene variant and the clinical manifestations presented by the girl is proposed. Previously, one case of DS and two of DS-like linked with GABRB3 mutations have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DS associated with this novel variant. A literature review of clinical cases with various types of epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) related to GABRB3 mutations is reported.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	2.1.

32954380	Reduction of endoglin receptor impairs mononuclear cell-migration	To test if the impairment of mononuclear cell (MNC) migration in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is due to the reduction of the endoglin (ENG) receptor on the cell surface and oxidative stress. MNCs of HHT patients and normal controls were subjected to migration assay. Fractions of MNCs were pre-incubated with antibodies specific to HHT causative genes ENG [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1)] or activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2)], AMD3100 or Diprotin-A to block ENG, ALK1 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) or CD26 (increased in HHT1 MNCs) before migration assay. The MNCs were allowed to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) for 18 h. The expression of CXCR4, CD26, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) in MNCs and nitric oxide levels in the plasma were analyzed. Compared to the controls, fewer HHT1 MNCs and similar number of HHT2 MNCs migrated toward SDF-1α. Diprotin-A pre-treatment improved HHT1 MNC-migration, but had no effect on normal and HHT2 MNCs. Pre-incubation with an anti-ENG antibody reduced the migration of normal MNCs. Diprotin-A did not improve the migration of ENG antibody pre-treated MNCs. Anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on MNC-migration. AMD3100 treatment reduced normal and HHT MNC-migration. ENG mRNA level was reduced in HHT1 and HHT2 MNCs. ALK1 mRNA was reduced in HHT2 MNCs only. CD26 expression was higher in HHT1 MNCs. Pre-treatment of MNCs with anti-ENG or anti-ALK1 antibody had no effect on CD26 and CXCR4 expression. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, SOD1, was reduced in HHT1 MNCs, which was accompanied with an increase of ROS in HHT MNCs and nitric oxide in HHT1 plasma. Reduction of ENG receptor on MNC surface reduced monocyte migration toward SDF-1α independent of CD26 expression. Increased oxidative stress could alter HHT MNC migration behavior.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		356	Reduction of endoglin receptor impairs mononuclear cell-migration.

32973305	Rheological analysis of sputum from patients with chronic bronchial diseases	Bronchial diseases are characterised by the weak efficiency of mucus transport through the lower airways, leading in some cases to the muco-obstruction of bronchi. It has been hypothesised that this loss of clearance results from alterations in the mucus rheology, which are reflected in sputum samples collected from patients, making sputum rheology a possible biophysical marker of these diseases and their evolution. However, previous rheological studies have focused on quasi-static viscoelastic (linear storage and loss moduli) properties only, which are not representative of the mucus mobilisation within the respiratory tract. In this paper, we extend this approach further, by analysing both quasi-static and some dynamic (flow point) properties, to assess their usability and relative performance in characterising several chronic bronchial diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis) and distinguishing them from healthy subjects. We demonstrate that pathologies influence substantially the linear and flow properties. Linear moduli are weakly condition-specific and even though the corresponding ranges overlap, distinct levels can be identified. This directly relates to the specific mucus structure in each case. In contrast, the flow point is found to strongly increase in muco-obstructive diseases, which may reflect the complete failure of mucociliary clearance causing episodic obstructions. These results suggest that the analysis of quasi-static and dynamic regimes in sputum rheology is in fact useful as these regimes provide complementary markers of chronic bronchial diseases.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

32998220	Topical Propranolol Improves Epistaxis Control in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT): A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial	Epistaxis is a common debilitating manifestation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), due to mucocutaneous telangiectases. The epistaxis can be difficult to control despite available treatments. Dysregulated angiogenesis has been shown to be associated with telangiectases formation. Topical propranolol has demonstrated antiangiogenic properties. **We performed a two-phase study, i.e., a double-blind placebo-controlled phase, followed by an open-label phase.** The aim of the study was assessment of** safety and efficacy** of nasal propranolol gel in HHT-related epistaxis. Twenty participants with moderate-severe HHT-related epistaxis were randomized to eight weeks of propranolol gel 1.5%, or placebo 0.5 cc, applied to each nostril twice daily; and continued propranolol for eight weeks in an open-label study. For the propranolol group, the epistaxis severity score (ESS) improved significantly (-2.03 ± 1.7 as compared with -0.35 ± 0.68 for the placebo group, p = 0.009); hemoglobin levels improved significantly (10.5 ± 2.6 to 11.4 ± 2.02 g/dL, p = 0.009); and intravenous iron and blood transfusion requirement decreased. The change in nasal endoscopy findings was not significant. During the open-label period, the ESS score improved significantly in the former placebo group (-1.99 ± 1.41, p = 0.005). The most common adverse event was nasal mucosa burning sensation. No cardiovascular events were reported. Our results suggest that topical propranolol gel is safe and effective in HHT-related epistaxis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

33010097	Impulse oscillometry and spirometry measurements relative to personal best values at the time of acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis in adults	Diagnosis of acute exacerbation (AE) of cystic fibrosis (CF) must be precise because both under- and over-prescription of antibiotics may be detrimental. How lung function tests contribute to diagnose AE is unclear. **We aimed to describe variation of spirometry and oscillometry measurements, at Stable state and at AE in adults with CF.** Patients were included in a retrospective single-centre study when both spirometry (FEV1, FVC) and oscillometry (X5, R5, R5-R20 and AX) data were available for at least one Stable and one AE visit between December 2016 and July 2019. For each visit, we calculated variation (Δ) in spirometry and oscillometry indices in comparison with personal best values. Measurements were expressed as % of predicted values and Z-scores when applicable. Areas under ROC curves (AUC) were computed. Forty-two patients (28 ± 9 years, FEV1 64 ± 21%) were included; 80 AE and 104 Stable visits were analysed. FEV1 (L, %pred and Z-score) and FVC (%pred and Z-score) varied significantly between AE and Stable visits (p < .05), although differences were small (80 ml/2.7%pred for FEV1). Among oscillometry indices, X5 (kPa.s.L-1 ), R5-R20 (kPa.s.L-1 ) and AX (kPa/L) varied significantly. The AUCs for the variation in spirometry indices ranged from 0.601 (ΔFVC L) to 0.635 (ΔFEV1%pred). They were not significantly different from the AUCs for ΔX5 (0.589), ΔR5-R20 (0.649) and ΔAX (0.598). Performance of both spirometry and oscillometry to discriminate AE from Stable state was poor. Variation of oscillometry indices (X5, R5-R20, AX) may be helpful when spirometry is unreliable or uncomfortable.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

CBD is metabolized in the liver and can influence the activity of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The best characterized drug-drug interaction is between CBD and clobazam. The most common adverse events include somnolence, gastrointestinal discomfort, and increase in serum transaminases. High-grade purified CBD oral solution represents an effective therapeutic option in patients with DS and LGS. The findings cannot be extrapolated to other cannabis-based products, synthetic cannabinoids for medicinal use and non-medicinal cannabis and CBD derivatives.

33046417	Extended-criteria uncontrolled DCD donor for a fragile recipient: A case report about a challenging yet successful lung transplantation.	Lung donation after circulatory death (DCD) has proved to be an effective strategy for expanding the donor pool, but is still considered challenging. We report a successful case of lung procurement from an extended-criteria uncontrolled DCD. We evaluated the lungs of an uncontrolled DCD from a hospital without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. The donor was a non-smoker 20-year old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, cardiocirculatory arrests, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Cardiac arrest occurred in a swimming pool, and bronchoscopy showed signs of inhalation. We employed our usual normothermic in-situ open-ventilated lung approach. After retrieval, lungs were stored on ice, then evaluated with ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and judged suitable for transplantation. The recipient was a 26-year old female with cystic fibrosis on long-term oxygen therapy, on the waitlist for up to 21 months due to her anthropomorphic characteristics. She required central VA-ECMO support during bilateral lung transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) within the first 72 h reached grade 3; post-operative peripheral VV-ECMO support was discontinued two days after surgery. _The patient was discharged 28 days after surgery; she is alive two years after transplantation with no signs of rejection nor anastomotic complications._ Despite the spreading use of lungs from controlled DCD, perplexities remain on uncontrolled DCD, namely: severe PDG, postoperative mortality, airway complications. Our case report suggests that good results can be achieved with uncontrolled DCD despite the presence of relative contraindications: inhalation of water, prolonged ischemic times and recipient in poor conditions.

Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that mostly affects the sweat glands, respiratory system, digestive system, and reproductive system. Many and various types of mutations have been reported in CFTR in different ethnicities and countries/regions. Analysis of CFTR gene rearrangements is recommended in patients with unidentified mutated alleles in CFTR sequencing analysis. We collected MLPA analyses of 527 patients from Turkey who had at least one unidentified mutation in CFTR sequence analysis. Heterozygous/homozygous deletions were detected in the CFTR gene in 49 individuals (9.2%) from 35 families. Twelve different single/multi exon deletions were demonstrated, two of which were not previously reported in the literature. Mutations have previously reported in patients from various regions including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and Turkey is located at a crossroads between them. The most frequent mutation was the exon 2 deletion, accounting for 60%. Moreover, patients with exon 2 deletions, were especially originated from northern Turkey. This finding is valuable in leading and shaping planned screening programs in Turkey. Our study, the most comprehensive study for rearrangement analysis in patients from Tukey, revealed a candidate hotspot region of patients suspected of having CFTR-related disorders from Turkey.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

33126875	New strategies of physical activity assessment in cystic fibrosis: a pilot study	Regular physical activity (PA) is a valued part of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Although the accelerometer, SenseWear Armband (SWA), accurately measures habitual PA in CF, it is mostly used for research purposes. For the first time, we analyzed different methods of measuring PA in daily life by the use of smartphones and other electronic devices such as smartwatch and Fitbit. Twenty-four stable adults with CF (mean age 37.5 ± 11.5SD yrs.; FEV1 58 ± 19% predicted, BMI 22.9 ± 3.2) were studied. Daily PA was monitored for seven consecutive days. All patients wore the accelerometer SWA and at the same time they monitored PA with the electronic device they used routinely. They were allocated into one of four arms according to their device: Smartwatch, Fitbit, Android smartphones and iOS smartphones. PA related measurements included: duration of PA, energy expenditure, number of steps. There was a good agreement between SWA and Fitbit for number of steps (p = 0.605) and energy expenditure (p = 0.143). iOS smartphones were similar to SWA in monitoring the number of steps (p = 0.911). Significant differences were found between SWA and both Smartwatch and Android smartphones. Fitbit and iOS smartphones seem to be a valuable approach to monitor daily PA. They provide a good performance to measure step number compared to SWA.	cystic fibrosis	1.1.

33202772	Crystal Structure of Isoform CBd of the Basic Phospholipase A2 Subunit of Crotoxin: Description of the Structural Framework of CB for Interaction with Protein Targets.	Crotoxin, from the venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus, is a potent heterodimeric presynaptic β-neurotoxin that exists in individual snake venom as a mixture of isoforms of a basic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) subunit (CBa2, CBb, CBc, and CBd) and acidic subunit (CA1-4). Specific natural mutations in CB isoforms are implicated in functional differences between crotoxin isoforms. The three-dimensional structure of two individual CB isoforms (CBa2, CBc), and one isoform in a crotoxin (CA2CBb) complex, have been previously reported. This study concerns CBd, which by interaction with various protein targets exhibits many physiological or pharmacological functions. It binds with high affinity to presynaptic receptors showing neurotoxicity, but also interacts with human coagulation factor Xa (hFXa), exhibiting anticoagulant effect, and acts as a positive allosteric modulator and corrector of mutated chloride channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), implicated in cystic fibrosis. Thus, CBd represents a novel family of agents that have potential in identifying new drug leads related to anticoagulant and anti-cystic fibrosis function. We determined here the X-ray structure of CBd and compare it with the three other natural isoforms of CB. The structural role of specific amino acid variations between CB isoforms are analyzed and the structural framework of CB for interaction with protein targets is described.	cystic fibrosis	2.1.

33225638	Role Of Long-Term Intermittent Use Of Oral Azithromycin On Pulmonary Exacerbations In Cystic Fibrosis Children	Pulmonary exacerbation is the most common acute event occurring in a patient with cystic fibrosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most commonly involved organism. Azithromycin has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects on the lungs and our study aimed to determine the role of long-term intermittent use of oral azithromycin on pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016 at a tertiary care hospital, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. The criteria for enrolment included cystic fibrosis patients aged 3-18 years who were classified into two groups based on their antibiotic use. The Azithromycin group included those CF patients who were on three days per week oral Azithromycin (10 mg per Kg per day) for 6 months. The non-azithromycin group included CF patients who were not on long term oral azithromycin. Our primary outcome was to assess the reduction in the number of exacerbations. Sixty-three patients with a mean age (10.06±3.80) and mean pulmonary exacerbations of (3.67±1.58) in the 6 months before enrolment were included in our study. Out of these, 30 patients were included in the azithromycin group and 33 patients in the non-azithromycin group. Overall, 180 exacerbations were documented during the study period. The one-way ANOVA (F (1,61) =8.033, p<0.05) demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the mean number of exacerbations between the azithromycin (2.70±1.72) and non-azithromycin group (3.81±1.40) however, the mean length of stay between the groups was not significant (p=0.582). P. aeruginosa was found to be the most predominant colonizer of the airways. Long term low dose azithromycin therapy is beneficial in young patients with cystic fibrosis. It is an effective prevention strategy for pulmonary exacerbations.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

This work is concerned with development of two methods for determination of rufinamide (RUF) in presence of 1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4 carboxylic acid as its alkaline degradation product in dosage form. The first method was capable of determing RUF in the presence of its alkaline degradation product and in dosage form. Kromasil C8 column and mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v) were used and UV detection at 210 nm. In the second method, first derivative ratio spectrophotometry, RUF was determined by measuring peak amplitude at 269.5 nm over 5-30 μg/mL. The linearity range of RUF was 10-90 μg/mL for HPLC method covering its therapeutic range with r2 = 0.9999. Forced degradation under alkaline conditions was carried out, the degradation product was isolated and its structure was confirmed. Both methods were validated in accordance to ICH guidelines. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between obtained results and reported ones. The present study is useful for therapeutic drug monitoring and routine analysis of RUF in quality control laboratories. Kinetics of the alkaline degradation of RUF was studied by following the concentration of the remaining drug until complete degradation was achieved.

33243256	High output cardiac failure in 3 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and hepatic vascular malformations, evaluation of treatment	This report addresses how patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and high output cardiac failure (HOCF) due to hepatic vascular malformations, should be evaluated and could be treated. HHT is a genetic disorder, leading to vascular abnormalities with potentially serious clinical implications. In the liver, arteriovenous malformations occur in more than 70% of patients, but only about 8% present clinical symptoms such as HOCF with pulmonary hypertension and less commonly portal hypertension, biliary ischemia and hepatic encephalopathy. Three female patients with HHT type 2 and HOCF caused by severe arteriovenous malformations in the liver are presented in this case series. The patients were seen at the HHT-Centre at Odense University Hospital. Treatment with either orthotopic liver transplantation (one patient) or bevacizumab (two patients) was initiated. All patients experienced marked symptom relief and objective improvement. New York Heart Association-class were improved, ascites, peripheral edema and hence diuretic treatment was markedly reduced or discontinued in all three patients. Bevacizumab also resulted in notable effects on epistaxis and anemia. Our findings substantiate the importance of identification of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations in the liver in patients with HHT. Bevacizumab may possibly, as suggested in this case series and supported by previous case studies, postpone the time to orthotopic liver transplantation or even make it unnecessary. Bevacizumab represents a promising new treatment option, which should be investigated further in clinical trials.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

33282178	Autologous correction in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-endothelial cells to identify a novel pathogenic mutation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. More than 80% hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients carry heterozygous mutations of Endoglin or Activin receptor-like kinase-1 genes. Endoglin plays important roles in vasculogenesis and human vascular disease. In this report, we found a novel missense mutation (c.88T > C) of Endoglin gene in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 patient. Induced pluripotent stem cells of the patient were generated and differentiated into endothelial cells. The hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells have reduced differentiation potential toward vascular endothelial cells and defective angiogenesis with impaired tube formation. Endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant Endoglin (Cys30Arg, C30R) causes less functional protein trafficking to cell surface, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 genetic correction of the c.88T > C mutation in induced pluripotent stem cells revealed that C30R mutation of Endoglin affects bone morphogenetic protein 9 downstream signaling. By establishing a human induced pluripotent stem cell from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous correction on mutant hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-induced pluripotent stem cells, we were able to identify a new disease-causing mutation, which facilitates us to understand the roles of Endoglin in vascular development and pathogenesis of related vascular diseases.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

33313501	Rare but life-threatening aspiration pneumonia related to initiation of clobazam therapy	Clobazam (CLB) was approved in October 2011 by the United States FDA as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients older than the age of 2. Due to its unique chemical design and selective binding to the alpha-2 GABA-receptor, CLB has a decreased tendency for sedation compared to other benzodiazepines. A recent literature review shows that sedation, hypersalivation (drooling), and behavior changes are the most common side effects of CLB. It has also been shown that a patient's level of consciousness is indirectly related to the risk of aspiration. Hypersalivation is too is a significant predisposing factor for aspiration.

33358132	Epidemiology, healthcare resource use, and mortality in patients with probable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A population-based study on German health insurance data.	This retrospective study examined patients with probable Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) identified from German healthcare data. This 10-year study (2007-2016) assessed healthcare insurance claims information from the Vilua Healthcare research database. A selection algorithm considering diagnoses and drug prescriptions identified patients with probable LGS. To increase the sensitivity of the identification algorithm, two populations were defined: all patients with probable LGS (broadly defined) and only those with a documented epilepsy diagnosis before 6 years of age (narrowly defined). This specific criterion was used as LGS typically has a peak seizure onset between age 3 and 5 years. Primary analyses were prevalence and demographics; secondary analyses included healthcare costs, hospitalization rate and length of stay (LOS), medication use, and mortality. In the final year of the study, 545 patients with broadly defined probable LGS (mean [range] age: 31.4 [2-89] years; male: 53%) were identified. Using the narrowly defined probable LGS definition, the number of patients was reduced to 102 (mean [range] age: 7.4 [2-14] years; male: 52%). Prevalence of broadly defined and narrowly defined probable LGS was 39.2 and 6.5 per 100,000 people. During the 10-year study, 208 patients with narrowly defined probable LGS were identified and followed up for 1379 patient-years. The mean annual cost of healthcare was €22,787 per patient-year (PPY); greatest costs were attributable to inpatient care (33%), home nursing care (13%), and medication (10%). Mean annual healthcare costs were significantly greater for those with prescribed rescue medication (45% of patient-years) versus those without (€33,872 vs. €13,785 PPY, p < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) annual hospitalization rate was 1.6 (2.0) PPY with mean (SD) annual LOS of 22.7 (46.0) days. Annual hospitalization rate was significantly greater in those who were prescribed rescue medication versus those who were not (2.2 [2.3] vs. 1.1 [1.6] PPY, p < 0.001). The mean (SD) number of different medications prescribed was 11.3 (7.3) PPY and 33.8 (17.0) over the entire observable time per patient (OET); antiepileptic drugs only accounted for 2.1 (1.1) of the medications prescribed PPY and 3.8 (2.0) OET. Over the 10-year study period, mortality in patients with narrowly defined probable LGS was significantly higher than the matched control population (six events [2.88%] vs. oneevent [0.01%], p < 0.001). Annual healthcare costs incurred by patients with probable LGS in Germany were substantial, and mostly attributable to inpatient care, home nursing care, and medication. Patients prescribed with rescue medication incurred significantly greater costs than those who were not. Patients with narrowly defined probable LGS had a higher mortality rate versus control populations.	Lennox-Gastaut syndrome			582	...

The mean annual cost of healthcare was €22,787 per patient-year (PPY); greatest costs were attributable to inpatient care (33%), home nursing care (13%), and medication (10%). Mean annual healthcare costs were significantly greater for those with prescribed rescue medication (45% of patient-years) versus those without (€33,872 vs. €13,785 PPY, p < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) annual hospitalization rate was 1.6 (2.0) PPY with mean (SD) annual LOS of 22.7 (46.0) days. Annual hospitalization rate was significantly greater in those who were prescribed rescue medication versus those who were not (2.2 [2.3] vs. 1.1 [1.6] PPY, p < 0.001). The mean (SD) number of different medications prescribed was 11.3 (7.3) PPY and 33.8 (17.0) over the entire observable time per patient (OET); antiepileptic drugs only accounted for 2.1 (1.1) of the medications prescribed PPY and 3.8 (2.0) OET. Over the 10-year study period, mortality in patients with narrowly defined probable LGS was significantly higher than the matched control population (six events [2.88%] vs. oneevent [0.01%], p < 0.001). Annual healthcare costs incurred by patients with probable LGS in Germany were substantial, and mostly attributable to inpatient care, home nursing care, and medication. Patients prescribed with rescue medication incurred significantly greater costs than those who were not. Patients with narrowly defined probable LGS had a higher mortality rate versus control populations.
33372033	Altered Fast Synaptic Transmission in a Mouse Model of DNM1-Associated Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy.	"Developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are severe seizure disorders that occur in infants and young children, characterized by developmental delay, cognitive decline, and early mortality. Recent efforts have identified a wide variety of genetic variants that cause DEEs. Among these, variants in the DNM1 gene have emerged as definitive causes of DEEs, including infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A mouse model of Dnm1-associated DEE, known as ""Fitful"" (Dnm1Ftfl ), recapitulates key features of the disease, including spontaneous seizures, early lethality, and neuronal degeneration. Previous work showed that DNM1 is a key regulator of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis and synaptic transmission and suggested that inhibitory neurotransmission may be more reliant on DNM1 function than excitatory transmission. The Dnm1Ftfl variant is thought to encode a dominant negative DNM1 protein; however, the effects of the Dnm1Ftfl variant on synaptic transmission are largely unknown. To understand these synaptic effects, we recorded from pairs of cultured mouse cortical neurons and characterized all four major connection types [excitation of excitation (E-E), inhibition of inhibition (I-I), E-I, I-E]. Miniature and spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were larger, but less frequent, at all Dnm1Ftfl synaptic types, and Dnm1Ftfl neurons had reduced expression of excitatory and inhibitory SV markers. Baseline evoked transmission, however, was reduced only at inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons, because of a smaller pool of releasable SVs. In addition to these synaptic alterations, Dnm1Ftfl neurons degenerated later in development, although their activity levels were reduced, suggesting that Dnm1Ftfl may impair synaptic transmission and neuronal health through distinct mechanisms."

33569502	Lumacaftor/ivacaftor-associated health stabilisation in adults with severe cystic fibrosis.	Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients homozygous for Phe508del with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % pred >40%. We assessed the clinical utility of LUM/IVA in all eligible adult CF patients with FEV1 % pred <40% treated for at least 1 year under a single-centre managed access programme. Following clinical optimisation, eligible patients (n=40) with FEV1 % pred <40% were commenced on LUM/IVA and monitored for tolerance and clinical outcomes, including health service utilisation, pulmonary function, weight and body composition. 24 patients reached 1 year of treatment by the time of evaluation. Six patients discontinued due to adverse events (five for increased airways reactivity) and three underwent lung transplantation. In comparison with the year prior to LUM/IVA commencement, significant reductions (median per year) were observed in the treatment year in the number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (from 3 to 1.5; p=0.0002), hospitalisation days (from 27 to 17; p=0.0002) and intravenous antibiotic (IVAB) usage days (from 45 to 27; p=0.0007). Mean±sd change in FEV1 % pred was -2.10±1.18% per year in the year prior, with the decline reversed in the year following (+1.45±1.13% per year; p=0.035), although there was significant heterogeneity in individual responses. Mean±sd weight gain at 1 year was 2.5±4.1 kg (p=0.0007), comprising mainly fat mass (mean 2.2 kg). The proportion of patients severely underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg·m-2) decreased from 33% at baseline to 13% at 1 year (p=0.003). This real-world evaluation study demonstrated benefits over several clinical domains (infective exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, IVABs, pulmonary function decline and nutritional parameters) in CF patients with severe lung disease.	cystic fibrosis	1.3.

33638459	The role of new medical treatments for the management of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: Novel concepts and results.	Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are among the most challenging of all epilepsies to manage, given the exceedingly frequent and often severe seizure types, pharmacoresistance to conventional antiseizure medications, and numerous comorbidities. During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.

33693596	Consciousness among delta waves: a paradox?	"A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the appearance of delta (1 - 4 Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high amplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are very frequently observed in states of diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalised epileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness such as coma and vegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high amplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical deactivation that occurs during the ""down states"" or troughs of these slow oscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of prominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the hypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of unconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, behavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful psychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely unacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients with high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a largely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the complexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalogram or MEG signals strongly relates to an individual's level of consciousness. Having reviewed this literature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming contradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We also consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we conclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by examining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral power."

3176552	Genotype and phenotype evaluation of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: First results from Turkey	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disease and the severity of the disease related with genetic analysis has been described in some previous studies. The main aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with genetically diagnosed PCD and to investigate the correlation between clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings and genetic analyses of these patients. This is a cohort study in which we analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and genetic results of 46 patients with genetically diagnosed PCD through whole-exome sequencing at our single center from a total of 265 patients with PCD within a 5-year period. Genetic analysis revealed pathogenic variants in DNAH5 (n = 12 individuals, 12 families), CCDC40 (n = 9 individuals, six families), RSPH4A (n = 5 individuals, three families), DNAH11 (n = 4 individuals, four families), HYDIN (n = 5 individuals, five families), CCNO (n = 4 individuals, four families), DNAI1 (n = 2 individuals, one family), ARMC4 (n = 2 individuals, two families), TTC25 (n = 1), DNAH1 (n = 1), and CCDC39 (n = 1) genes. Although not statistically significant, the age at diagnosis was lower (median: 3 years; range, 6 months-4 years) in patients with CCNO pathogenic variants due to the early reporting of symptoms, and the median body mass index (BMI) and BMI z scores were lower in patients at 18.7 and 16 kg/m2 , and -0.78 and -1.2 with CCDC40 and CCNO pathogenic variants, respectively. The median forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%), and forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75% were 53%, 64%, and 28%, respectively; these parameters were also lower in the CCDC40 group than in the other groups. There was no significant correlation between the genetic results and symptoms, radiologic findings, and microbiologic data of patients with PCD. In PCD, there was significant heterogeneity of lung disease, patients who had pathogenic variants in CCNO presented earlier, and those with CCDC40 and CCNO had worse lung disease, and poorer nutritional status compared with the other subgroups. We hope that whole genotype-phenotype and clinical relationships will be identified in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

19675306	Conditional deletion of dnaic1 in a murine model of primary ciliary dyskinesia causes chronic rhinosinusitis	Studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model because disruption of essential ciliary genes in mice results in a high incidence of lethal hydrocephalus. To develop a viable mouse model for long-term studies of PCD, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which two conserved exons of the mouse intermediate dynein chain gene, Dnaic1, are flanked by loxP sites (Dnaic1(flox/flox)). Dnaic1 is the murine homolog of human DNAI1, which is mutated in approximately 10% of human PCD cases. These mice have been crossed with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER). Treatment of adult Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) mice with tamoxifen results in an almost complete deletion of Dnaic1 with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Treated animals have reduced levels of full-length Dnaic1 mRNA, and electron micrographs of cilia demonstrate a loss of outer dynein arm structures. In treated Dnaic1(flox/flox)/CreER(+/-) animals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) was reduced over time. After approximately 3 months, no MCC was observed in the nasopharynx, whereas in the trachea, MCC was observed for up to 6 months, likely reflecting a difference in the turnover of ciliated cells in these tissues. All treated animals developed severe rhinosinusitis, demonstrating the importance of MCC to the health of the upper airways. However, no evidence of lung disease was observed up to 11 months after Dnaic1 deletion, suggesting that other mechanisms are able to compensate for the lack of MCC in the lower airways of mice. This model will be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

19840971	A 20-year experience of electron microscopy in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of ciliary ultrastructure is classically used for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We report our extensive experience of TEM analysis in a large series of patients in order to evaluate its feasibility and results. TEM analysis performed in 1,149 patients with suspected PCD was retrospectively reviewed. Biopsies (1,450) were obtained from nasal (44%) or bronchial (56%) mucosa in children (66.5%) and adults (33.5%). TEM analysis was feasible in 71.4% of patients and showed a main defect suggestive of PCD in 29.9%. TEM was more feasible in adults than in children, regardless of the biopsy site. Main defects suggestive of PCD were found in 76.9% of patients with sinopulmonary symptoms and in only 0.4% of patients with isolated upper and 0.4% with isolated lower respiratory tract infections. The defect pattern was similar in children and adults, involving dynein arms (81.2%) or central complex (CC) (18.8%). Situs inversus was never observed in PCD patients with CC defect. Kartagener syndrome with normal ciliary ultrastructure was not an exceptional condition (10.2% of PCD). In conclusion, TEM analysis is feasible in most patients and is particularly useful for PCD diagnosis in cases of sinopulmonary syndrome of unknown origin.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

19924426	Automated software for analysis of ciliary beat frequency and metachronal wave orientation in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have structural and/or functional alterations of cilia that imply deficits in mucociliary clearance and different respiratory pathologies. A useful indicator for the difficult diagnosis is the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) that is significantly lower in pathological cases than in physiological ones. The CBF computation is not rapid, therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an automated method to evaluate it directly from videos of ciliated cells. The cells are taken from inferior nasal turbinates and videos of ciliary movements are registered and eventually processed by the developed software. The software consists in the extraction of features from videos (written with C++ language) and the computation of the frequency (written with Matlab language). This system was tested both on the samples of nasal cavity and software models, and the results were really promising because in a few seconds, it can compute a reliable frequency if compared with that measured with visual methods. It is to be noticed that the reliability of the computation increases with the quality of acquisition system and especially with the sampling frequency. It is concluded that the developed software could be a useful mean for PCD diagnosis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY + INFORMATICS	1.1.

We describe the history of a 12-month-old boy in whom the correct diagnosis of PCD was achieved after the occurrence of ethmoid mucocele associated with omolateral proptosis. A careful description of this new feature of PCD and its dangerous complications are also presented.
20097527	Ventricular rotation is independent of cardiac looping: a study in mice with situs inversus totalis using speckle-tracking echocardiography	The authors conducted an ultrasound interrogation of a mutant mouse model with a Dnah5 mutation to determine whether cardiac mechanics may be affected by reversal of cardiac situs. This mutant is a bona fide model of primary ciliary dyskinesia, with surviving homozygous mice showing either situs solitus (SS) or situs inversus totalis (SI). High-frequency ultrasound interrogations of 27 neonatal and infant Dnah5 mutant mice, 16 with SS and 11 with SI, were conducted using an ultra-high-frequency biomicroscope. Electrocardiographic and respiratory gating were used to reconstruct high-resolution two-dimensional cines at 1,000 Hz, with speckle-tracking echocardiography used to further analyze midchamber and apical rotation. All SS mice exhibited the expected counterclockwise apical rotation as viewed caudocranially, and surprisingly, the same counterclockwise motion was also observed in SI mice. Speckle-tracking analysis confirmed counterclockwise systolic rotation in both SS and SI mice, and this increased in magnitude from the subepicardium to the endocardium and from the papillary muscles to the apex. The magnitude of apical endocardial rotation was not different for SS and SI mice (5.64+/-0.75 degrees and 5.76+/-1.90 degrees, respectively, P=.93). The anatomic segments responsible for the largest components of apical endocardial systolic rotation differed between the SS and SI hearts (P=.004). In both, the two largest contributors to rotation were offset 180 degrees from each other, but the anatomic regions differed between them. In SS hearts, maximal regional rotation occurred at the anterior mid-septum and posterolateral free wall, while in SI hearts, it was derived from the posterior septum and the anterolateral free wall. Analysis by episcopic fluorescence image capture histology of representative SI and SS mice showed normal intracardiac and segmental anatomy ({S,D,S} or {I,L,I}) without intracardiac defects. These results show that mirror-image cardiac looping did not result in mirror-image rotation of the morphologic left ventricle. These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether fiber orientation and cardiac mechanics may be abnormal in individuals with reversal of cardiac situs. The results of this study indicate that cardiac looping and myofiber orientation may be independently regulated.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

20106870	Deletion of the Parkin co-regulated gene causes defects in ependymal ciliary motility and hydrocephalus in the quakingviable mutant mouse	The quakingviable mouse (qkv) is a spontaneous recessive mouse mutant with a deletion of approximately 1.1 Mb in the proximal region of chromosome 17. The deletion affects the expression of three genes; quaking (Qk), Parkin-coregulated gene (Pacrg) and parkin (Park2). The resulting phenotype, which includes dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression, respectively. Pacrg is required for correct development of the spermatozoan flagella, a specialized type of motile cilia. In vertebrates, motile cilia are required for multiple functions related to cellular movement or movement of media over a stationary cell surface. To investigate the potential role of PACRG in motile cilia we analysed qkv mutant mice for evidence of cilial dysfunction. Histological and magnetic resonance imaging analyses demonstrated that qkv mutant mice were affected by acquired, communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structural analysis of ependymal cilia demonstrated that the 9 + 2 arrangement of axonemal microtubules was intact and that both the density of ciliated cells and cilia length was similar to wild-type littermates. Cilia function studies showed a reduction in ependymal cilial beat frequency and cilial mediated flow in qkv mutant mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Moreover, transgenic expression of Pacrg was necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC phenotype in the qkv mutant. This study provides novel in vivo evidence that Pacrg is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia and primary ciliary dyskinesia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

20167855	Lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a cross-sectional and 3-decade longitudinal study	Early diagnosis and treatment is considered important to prevent lung damage in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Few studies have addressed long-term evolution of lung function after PCD diagnosis. We investigated whether long-term lung function was dependent on age or level of lung function at PCD diagnosis. An observational, single-center, cross-sectional, and three-decade longitudinal study of FEV(1) and FVC related to age at diagnosis until current age was performed. Linear regression was used to describe the relation between first measured lung function values and age at diagnosis across the cohort. Courses of lung function after diagnosis and the according slopes were used to group patients into increasing, stable, or decreasing courses. Additionally, slopes from courses of 10 years of follow-up were related to age at diagnosis and initial level of lung function, respectively, using linear regression. Seventy-four children and adults with PCD were observed for median 9.5 (range, 1.5-30.2) years during which 2,937 lung function measurements were performed. First measured FEV(1) was less than 80% of predicted in one-third of preschool-diagnosed children. During observation, 34% of patients lost more than 10 percentage points, 57% were stable, and 10% improved more than 10 percentage points in FEV(1). Courses of lung function after diagnosis were related to neither age at diagnosis nor initial level. Our study strongly suggests that PCD is a disease of serious threat to lung function already at preschool age, and with a high degree of variation in courses of lung function after diagnosis that was not linked to either age or level of lung function at diagnosis. Early diagnosis did not protect against decline in lung function.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

20220176	Analysis of genetic inheritance in a family quartet by whole-genome sequencing	We analyzed the whole-genome sequences of a family of four, consisting of two siblings and their parents. Family-based sequencing allowed us to delineate recombination sites precisely, identify 70% of the sequencing errors (resulting in > 99.999% accuracy), and identify very rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We also directly estimated a human intergeneration mutation rate of approximately 1.1 x 10(-8) per position per haploid genome. Both offspring in this family have two recessive disorders: Miller syndrome, for which the gene was concurrently identified, and primary ciliary dyskinesia, for which causative genes have been previously identified. Family-based genome analysis enabled us to narrow the candidate genes for both of these Mendelian disorders to only four. Our results demonstrate the value of complete genome sequencing in families.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.4.

20335083	Value of nasal nitric oxide in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	The aim of this study is to report nasal nitric oxide (nNO) values in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and to compare them with nNO values in healthy children, asthmatic children, children with cystic fibrosis and children with post infectious bronchiectasis. We determined nNO values in 9 children with PCD, 36 asthmatic children, 31 children with cystic fibrosis, 8 children with post infectious bronchiectasis and 37 healthy children. We compared nNO values between these different conditions and calculated sensitivity and specificity of nNO to diagnose PCD. All children with PCD - except one (nNO 348 ppb) - had nNO values below 112 ppb, mean 88 ppb (95%CI 9.6-166). The nNO mean was 898 ppb (95%CI 801-995) in healthy children, 1023 ppb (95%CI 911-1137) in asthmatic children, 438 ppb (95%CI 367-508) in cystic fibrosis children and 361 ppb (95%CI 252-470) in children with post infectious bronchiectasis. The mean concentration of nNO was lower (P<0.05) in PCD patients, compared to the other groups. The measurement of nasal NO in our study population showed, at a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb, a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 99.1% in the diagnosis of PCD [ROC 0.98 (95%CI 0.94-0.99); P<0.0001; probability ratio 95.1]. The measurement of nasal NO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD, in which a cut-off level of < or =112 ppb suggests the disease, although nNO above 112 ppb does not exclude PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

20421426	Pcdp1 is a central apparatus protein that binds Ca(2+)-calmodulin and regulates ciliary motility	For all motile eukaryotic cilia and flagella, beating is regulated by changes in intraciliary calcium concentration. Although the mechanism for calcium regulation is not understood, numerous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is a key axonemal calcium sensor. Using anti-CaM antibodies and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii axonemal extracts, we precipitated a complex that includes four polypeptides and that specifically interacts with CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. One of the complex members, FAP221, is an orthologue of mammalian Pcdp1 (primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1). Both FAP221 and mammalian Pcdp1 specifically bind CaM in high [Ca(2+)]. Reduced expression of Pcdp1 complex members in C. reinhardtii results in failure of the C1d central pair projection to assemble and significant impairment of motility including uncoordinated bends, severely reduced beat frequency, and altered waveforms. These combined results reveal that the central pair Pcdp1 (FAP221) complex is essential for control of ciliary motility.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

20530032	Factors influencing age at diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in European children	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary disorder of mucociliary clearance causing chronic upper and lower airways disease. We determined the number of patients with diagnosed PCD across Europe, described age at diagnosis and determined risk factors for late diagnosis. Centres treating children with PCD in Europe answered questionnaires and provided anonymous patient lists. In total, 223 centres from 26 countries reported 1,009 patients aged < 20 yrs. Reported cases per million children (for 5-14 yr olds) were highest in Cyprus (111), Switzerland (47) and Denmark (46). Overall, 57% were males and 48% had situs inversus. Median age at diagnosis was 5.3 yrs, lower in children with situs inversus (3.5 versus 5.8 yrs; p < 0.001) and in children treated in large centres (4.1 versus 4.8 yrs; p = 0.002). Adjusted age at diagnosis was 5.0 yrs in Western Europe, 4.8 yrs in the British Isles, 5.5 yrs in Northern Europe, 6.8 yrs in Eastern Europe and 6.5 yrs in Southern Europe (p < 0.001). This strongly correlated with general government expenditures on health (p < 0.001). This European survey suggests that PCD in children is under-diagnosed and diagnosed late, particularly in countries with low health expenditures. Prospective studies should assess the impact this delay might have on patient prognosis and on health economic costs across Europe.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.4. EPIDEMIOLOGY	1.1.

20537283	Role of adenylate kinase type 7 expression on cilia motility: possible link in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) mediates the reaction 2ADP <--> ATP + AMP, providing energy for the beating of cilia. A study recently showed that AK7 expression may be correlated with the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) phenotype in mice. In this study, we characterized AK7 expression in vitro in an air-liquid interface (ALI) model and in middle nasal turbinate biopsy specimens from a cohort of patients with PCD to elucidate whether AK7 expression is correlated with ciliary malfunction. AK7 expression was measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. In vitro differentiated nasal human epithelial cell siRNA experiments were performed to investigate the effect of AK7 expression on ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Ciliary motility and ultrastructure were evaluated in a cohort of 29 patients with PCD (PCD, n = 17; Kartagener's syndrome, n = 12) and 26 healthy control donors. AK7 expression was mainly located on the apical surface of differentiated nasal ALI cells, and targeted suppression of the AK7 gene decreased CBF by 41%. AK7 expression was diminished significantly in patients with PCD (0.54 +/- 0.1-fold; p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls (1.1 +/- 0.08-fold). Furthermore, AK7 expression was correlated with CBF in patients with PCD (r = 0.5; p = 0.009).

20550487	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a patient with Kartagener syndrome	We present a case of a patient with clinically definite ALS, who had earlier suffered from Kartagener syndrome, which is characterized by the triad comprising chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. Recent linkage and mutational analyses identified several genes that are responsible for Kartagener syndrome. Most of them encode subunits of axonemal dyneins, highlighting the importance of dynein motors to ciliary motility. Recent data indicate that defects in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport are involved in the etiology of ALS. Genes encoding the dynein heavy chain of cytoplasmic and outer arm axonemal dyneins are reported to have similar sequences in their central and 3'-end regions. Although a causal link between ALS and Kartagener syndrome has not yet been definitely established, the precise relationship between disrupted axonemal dynein function in Kartagener syndrome and motor neuron death should be investigated.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

20560440	Kartagener syndrome with lung cancer and mediastinal tumor	A 71-year-old man was admitted to Kanto Central Hospital with hemoptysis. He had had chronic sinusitis and deafness since childhood. Situs inversus, bronchiectasia, and diffuse panbronchiolitis had been also diagnosed at the age of 59. Chest computed tomography demonstrated a 5-cm mass in the anterior mediastinum as well as a 4-cm mass in the upper lobe of the right lung. A transbronchial lung biopsy of the right lung tumor revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Electron microscopic examination of the bronchial epithelial cilia revealed a total defect of both inner and outer dynein arms, leading to a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Biopsy of the mediastinal tumor was not performed. After concurrent chemoradiation therapy, the lung cancer decreased in size partial remission (PR) and the mediastinal tumor disappeared complete remission (CR). Later, a cavity formed in the tumor, where a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection occurred. He died 1 year after the diagnosis of lung cancer was established. There have been 5 reported cases of Kartagener syndrome complicated with lung cancer, but to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports of Kartagener syndrome with mediastinal tumor.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

Later, a cavity formed in the tumor, where a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection occurred. He died 1 year after the diagnosis of lung cancer was established. There have been 5 reported cases of Kartagener syndrome complicated with lung cancer, but to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports of Kartagener syndrome with mediastinal tumor.
20564725	Characteristics of chloride transport in nasal mucosa from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that produces lifelong difficulties with chronic airway inflammation. Little is known about the role of chronic airway inflammation on chloride ion transport properties in PCD. This study assessed the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride (Cl) ion transport properties of freshly excised nasal mucosa from PCD compared with normal and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Electrophysiology study utilizing Ussing type hemi-chamber technique with three different types of nasal tissue (normal, CRS, PCD) obtained from patients during endoscopic surgery at a tertiary referral center. Nasal tissues were examined under short-circuit conditions, and gradient-driven Cl currents were continuously recorded. The cAMP elevating agonist (forskolin) was added to stimulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl secretion. To prevent misinterpretation of flux measurement, Cl transport inhibitors were used at the end of all experiments. Basal Cl currents (I(Cl)) and changes in I(Cl) to forskolin (DeltaI(Cl)) were compared between normal, CRS, and PCD nasal tissues. Forskolin stimulated Cl currents across all different types of nasal epithelia. The Cl secretory response was effectively blocked by the Cl ion transport inhibitors. I(Cl) were significantly higher in normals (155.0 +/- 9.3 microA/cm(2)) compared to CRS (79.1 +/- 15.0 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (70.9 +/- 20.4 microA/cm(2)) (P = .005). DeltaI(Cl) in CRS (14.8 +/- 2.3 microA/cm(2)) and PCD (12.2 +/- 2.4 microA/cm(2)) were markedly diminished compared to normals (28.3 +/- 4.7 microA/cm(2)) (P = .024). PCD tissues were characterized by impaired I(Cl) and DeltaI(Cl). Both parameters were reduced by 54.3% and 56.9% in PCD when compared to normals.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

20618958	Isolation and characterization of microparticles in sputum from cystic fibrosis patients	Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles released during cell activation and apoptosis. MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a+-and CD66b+-, but not CD11b+-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

20631900	Triple-vessel percutaneous coronary revascularization in situs inversus dextrocardia	Dextrocardia with situs inversus occurs in approximately one in 10,000 individuals of whom 20% have primary ciliary dyskinesia inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. These patients have a high incidence of congenital cardiac disease but their risk of coronary artery disease is similar to that of the general population. We report what is, to our knowledge, the first case of total triple-vessel coronary revascularization by percutaneous stent implantation in a 79-year-old woman with situs inversus dextrocardia. We describe the successful use of standard diagnostic and interventional guide catheters with counter rotation and transversely inversed image acquisition techniques. The case also highlights that the right precordial pain may represent cardiac ischemia in this population.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

20650983	Agenesis of paranasal sinuses and nasal nitric oxide in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Agenesis of paranasal sinuses has only been described in case reports of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). As agenesis of paranasal sinuses may contribute to low nasal nitric oxide levels, a common finding in PCD, we speculated that this condition might frequently occur in PCD patients. Patients referred for PCD evaluation were consecutively recruited for 30 months. In addition to standard diagnostic testing for PCD, a computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal sinuses was performed in all subjects. 86 patients (46 children aged 8-17 yrs) were studied. PCD was diagnosed in 41 subjects and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) was diagnosed in the remaining 45 subjects. Frontal and/or sphenoidal sinuses were either aplastic or hypoplastic on CT scans in 30 (73%) out of 41 PCD patients, but in only 17 (38%) out of 45 with SCD (p = 0.002). There was a significant inverse correlation between the score for aplasia/hypoplasia of each paranasal sinus and nasal NO values in the PCD patients (p = 0.008, r = -0.432) but not in SCD (p = 0.07, r = -0.271). The findings of aplasia/hypoplasia of the frontal and or sphenoidal sinuses may be part of the spectrum of PCD and this finding should prompt exclusion of this condition.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

20682136	Nasal nitric oxide and pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance as supplementary tools in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by abnormalities in ciliary structure and/or function. Frequent, intermittent or chronic airway infections precipitated by impaired airway mucociliary clearance may cause permanent lung damage and reduced lung function. Early diagnosis is considered important for the prevention of lung damage, but diagnosis is probably often delayed or even missed since diagnosis of PCD is both complex and time consuming, and yet not always exact. The aims of this PhD thesis were to evaluate the discriminative capacity and ""real-life"" clinical application of two candidates for supplemental diagnostic testing for PCD: Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement placed as a first line test to point out probable PCD patients for further investigation or exclude patients, regardless of age, Pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance (PRMC) as a second line test for PCD investigation in children from 5 years of age. And additionally, Proposing an algorithm for the pathway of diagnosing PCD based on these two studies and recommendations from the literature. Nasal NO and PRMC demonstrated to be two highly valid supplementary diagnostic tools to be placed in each end of the diagnostic pathway when investigating selected patients referred for PCD work up. Nasal NO measurement demonstrated to have an obvious place as a first line test in the pathway of PCD investigation and PRMC as second line test as a supplement to ciliary function test and EM-test in cases of difficult diagnoses.

20709053	Characterization of the medaka (Oryzias latipes) primary ciliary dyskinesia mutant, jaodori: Redundant and distinct roles of dynein axonemal intermediate chain 2 (dnai2) in motile cilia	Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles that have diverse motility and sensory functions. Motility defects in cilia and flagella result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We isolated a novel medaka PCD mutant, jaodori (joi). Positional cloning showed that axonemal dynein intermediate chain 2 (dnai2) is responsible for joi. The joi mutation was caused by genomic insertion of the medaka transposon, Tol1. In the joi mutant, cilia in Kupffer's vesicle (KV), an organ functionally equivalent to the mouse node in terms of left-right (LR) specification, are generated but their motility is disrupted, resulting in a LR defect. Ultrastructural analysis revealed severe reduction in the outer dynein arms in KV cilia of joi mutants. We also found the other dnai2 gene in the medaka genome. These two dnai2 genes function either redundantly or distinctly in tissues possessing motile cilia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3. NON IN-VIVO HUMAN MODEL SYSTEM	2.1.

20938370	Skeletal muscle metabolism in cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia	Previous studies have reported differences in muscle function and metabolism between patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls (HC), but it is currently unknown whether these abnormalities are specific to CF or also seen in other airway diseases. In this study, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during exercise to assess muscle metabolism in CF patients. Twenty patients with CF and 20 age, gender, and habitual activity-matched HCs and a respiratory disease comparison group with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; n = 10) were studied. Phosphorus MRS (P-MRS) was used to characterize muscle bioenergetic metabolism at rest and after high-, moderate-, and low-intensity exercise. CF patients exhibited lower resting ATP/phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio and significantly higher end-exercise pH values compared with both HC and PCD patients. Both CF and PCD patients demonstrated significantly slower PCr recovery time constants after high-intensity exercise. Our results suggest that not only there are specific abnormalities of muscle metabolism in CF patients but also there is a nonspecific impact of respiratory disease on muscle function.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21073540	Nasal nitric oxide levels in healthy pre-school children	The evaluation of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) has been proposed as a screening tool in children with clinically suspectable primary ciliary dyskinesia. Nevertheless, normal values have been reported for school-aged children. This study was designed to identify normal nNO levels in pre-school children. nNO was assessed in 300 healthy children aged between 1.5 and 7.2. Two hundred and fifty of them were unable to fulfill the guideline requirements for nNO measurement and were assessed by sampling the nasal air continuously with a constant trans-nasal aspiration flow for 30 s during tidal breathing. For those children who were able to cooperate, the average nNO concentration was calculated according to guidelines. A statistically significant relationship between nNO level and age was demonstrated in this study group of pre-school children (p < 0.001). An increase in nNO of about 100 ppb was observed in children older than 6 yr vs. those aged < 3. This study presents a description of normal nNO values in pre-school children. The effect of the age and the eventual presence of rhinitis and snoring need to be considered whenever nNO is evaluated in the clinical practice, in particular in non-cooperative children.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

21131972	CCDC39 is required for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex and for normal ciliary motility in humans and dogs	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, reduced fertility in males and situs inversus in about 50% of affected individuals (Kartagener syndrome). It is caused by motility defects in the respiratory cilia that are responsible for airway clearance, the flagella that propel sperm cells and the nodal monocilia that determine left-right asymmetry. Recessive mutations that cause PCD have been identified in genes encoding components of the outer dynein arms, radial spokes and cytoplasmic pre-assembly factors of axonemal dyneins, but these mutations account for only about 50% of cases of PCD. We exploited the unique properties of dog populations to positionally clone a new PCD gene, CCDC39. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the human ortholog underlie a substantial fraction of PCD cases with axonemal disorganization and abnormal ciliary beating. Functional analyses indicated that CCDC39 localizes to ciliary axonemes and is essential for assembly of inner dynein arms and the dynein regulatory complex.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

21225838	High yield technique to diagnose immotile cilia syndrome: a suggested algorithm	To determine the efficacy of our nasal brush biopsy technique to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia. Retrospective chart review at an urban children's hospital. We obtained medical records of all patients who underwent an endoscopic guided ciliary brush biopsy from January 2000 to June 2008. Data recorded included the procedure date, biopsy location, presence of motility on light microscopy, and whether specimen was sent for electron microscopy and those results. Sixty pediatric patients between the ages of 16 months and 17.3 years with chronic sinusitis (35 males, 25 females) were identified. Three were excluded because biopsies were taken from a non nasal location. Forty-seven specimens had light microscopy evaluation only, as normal motile cilia were identified. Ten had haphazard or absent motility and required further evaluation with electron microscopy. Electron microscopy ruled out defects for three samples, was non-diagnostic for five, and the remaining two reports could not be found. Overall, in 47/57 (82%) cases, light microscopy alone ruled out primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Using both methods, there was a 91% success rate in ruling out PCD. Obtaining an endoscopic biopsy with a cytosoft cytology brush (Camarillo California) from the posterior portion of the inferior turbinate gave sufficient specimen to examine for PCD. Light microscopy alone or in concert with evaluation by electron microscopy confirmed normal cilia in 91% of specimens ruling out the diagnosis of PCD. The algorithm suggested is simple and has high success in allowing the clinician to exclude the diagnosis of PCD in the patient with chronic or recurrent upper respiratory infections.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Gene expression of endothelial (NOS3) and inducible NOS (NOS2) and their correlation with nNO level, ciliary function and morphology were studied in patients with PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). NOS3 gene polymorphisms were studied in blood leukocytes. A total of 212 subjects were studied (48 with PCD, 161 with SCD and three normal subjects). nNO level correlated with mean ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.044; r = 0.174). The lower the nNO level the higher was the percentage of immotile cilia (p<0.001; r = -0.375). A significant positive correlation between NOS2 gene expression and nNO levels was demonstrated in all children (p = 0.001; r = 0.428), and this correlation was confirmed in patients with PCD (p = 0.019; r = 0.484). NOS2 gene expression was lower in PCD than in SCD (p = 0.04). The NOS3 isoform correlated with missing central microtubules (p = 0.048; r = 0.447). nNO levels were higher in PCD subjects with the NOS3 thymidine 894 mutation, and this was associated with a higher ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.045). These results demonstrate a relationship between nNO level, NOS mRNA expression and ciliary beat frequency.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

NOS2 gene expression was lower in PCD than in SCD (p = 0.04). The NOS3 isoform correlated with missing central microtubules (p = 0.048; r = 0.447). nNO levels were higher in PCD subjects with the NOS3 thymidine 894 mutation, and this was associated with a higher ciliary beat frequency (p = 0.045). These results demonstrate a relationship between nNO level, NOS mRNA expression and ciliary beat frequency.
21284095	Diagnostic yield of nasal scrape biopsies in primary ciliary dyskinesia: a multicenter experience	Examination of ciliary ultrastructure remains the cornerstone diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of abnormal ciliary structure and/or function. Obtaining a biopsy with sufficient interpretable cilia and producing quality transmission electron micrographs (TEM) is challenging. Methods for processing tissues for optimal preservation of axonemal structures are not standardized. This study describes our experience using a standard operating procedure (SOP) for collecting nasal scrape biopsies and processing TEMs in a centralized laboratory. We enrolled patients with suspected PCD at research sites of the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium. Biopsies were performed according to a SOP whereby curettes were used to scrape the inferior surface of the inferior turbinate, with samples placed in fixative. Specimens were shipped to a central laboratory where TEMs were prepared and blindly reviewed. Four hundred forty-eight specimens were obtained from 107 young children (0-5 years), 189 older children (5-18 years), and 152 adults (> 18 years), and 88% were adequate for formal interpretation. The proportion of adequate specimens was higher in adults than in children. Fifty percent of the adequate TEMs showed normal ciliary ultrastructure, 39% showed hallmark ultrastructural changes of PCD, and 11% had indeterminate findings. Among specimens without clearly normal ultrastructure, 72% had defects of the outer and/or inner dynein arms (IDA), while 7% had central apparatus defects with or without IDA defects. In summary, nasal scrape biopsies can be performed in the outpatient setting and yield interpretable samples, when performed by individuals with adequate training and experience according to an SOP.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21406509	Inner dynein arm defects causing primary ciliary dyskinesia: repeat testing required	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) results in chronic nasal symptoms and chest disease leading to bronchiectasis. We noted a number of patients referred for diagnostic testing whose initial results suggested PCD due to an inner dynein arm or radial spoke defect but in whom no abnormality was found on retesting. The present study was an audit of all patients referred for PCD diagnostic testing over a 3-yr period whose initial electron microscopy (EM) and beat pattern analysis suggested an inner dynein arm or radial spoke defect. 21 patients referred for diagnostic testing for PCD suspected of an inner dynein arm defect and six suspected of a radial spoke defect on initial EM and beat pattern analysis had repeat testing performed. On repeat testing, five patients initially suspected of an inner dynein arm defect and one with a radial spoke defect had normal EM and beat pattern, leading to the initial diagnosis being questioned. Patients suspected of PCD due to an inner dynein arm defect or radial spoke defect should have the diagnosis reassessed if it has been based on only one diagnostic sample.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21413977	Measurement of nasal nitric oxide by hand-held and stationary devices	Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is assessed by nasal aspiration/insufflation via one nostril or by nasal silent exhalation through a facemask and is also measured during humming, a manoeuvre that results in increased nNO in the presence of a patent osteomeatal complex. Humming nNO peak is absent in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hand-held devices are used successfully for exhaled or nNO analysis. No study compared nNO during silent and humming exhalation using hand-held and stationary analysers. Thirty-eight subjects (14 PCD; 11 CF; 13 healthy individuals) measured nNO with a stationary and a hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalations. No difference between nNO obtained from stationary or hand-held analyser during silent and humming exhalation was found (P > 0·05). Patients with PCD exhibited lower silent and humming nNO than CF or controls (P < 0·001). During both silent and humming exhalation, there was a significant correlation between nNO from the two analyzers both in the whole study population and within each group (r ≥ 0·7, P < 0·01). Bland-Altman plots confirmed this agreement. Using the hand-held device during humming, nNO values of 50, 81 and 21 ppb had sensitivity and specificity > 90% for discriminating PCD or CF from healthy subjects, and patients with PCD from patients with CF, respectively. The hand-held device is as effective as the stationary analyzer for assessing nNO during silent and humming exhalation. Its wider use might result in an increased number of subjects suspected to have PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21447516	Complex cardiac anatomy and catheter access: the role of imaging in patients referred for catheter ablation	A 66-year-old man with Kartagener's syndrome, situs inversus totalis, and recurrent supraventricular tachycardia and a 49-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and drug-refractory rapid ventricular rate response were referred for catheter ablation. In the first case, the mirrored anatomy of the right atrium was reconstructed using three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping, which guided successful ablation of a typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. In the second case, computerized tomography showed the presence of left atrial isomerism with interruption of the inferior vena cava and azygous continuation into the superior vena cava, guiding advancement of the ablation catheter for access into the positionally right atrial ablation site. These cases illustrate the role of imaging in patients with unusual anatomy of the cardiac chambers and major blood vessels guiding optimal catheter access for catheter ablation.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

21508109	Optic nerve projections in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Recently, it has been suggested that misprojections of the temporal retina to the contralateral hemisphere might not be specific for patients with albinism and might also be associated with the Kartagener syndrome (i.e., with situs inversus totalis in the presence of primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). The authors tested whether such projection abnormalities are associated with PCD and situs inversus. In 10 patients with PCD (five with situs inversus totalis) and in 10 age- and sex-matched controls, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded monocularly, as follows: conventional pattern-onset VEPs (cVEPs) and multifocal VEPs (mfVEPs) for 60 locations constituting a visual field of 44° diameter. cVEPs from 13 albinotic subjects were included as a reference. For each eye, interhemispheric difference potentials were calculated and correlated with each other to assess the lateralization of the responses: positive and negative correlation coefficients indicated lateralizations on same or opposite hemispheres, respectively. Misrouted optic nerves are expected to yield negative interocular correlations. For both cVEPs and mfVEPs, the distribution of the correlation coefficients in the PCD patients yielded largely positive values and did not differ from that of the controls. Consequently, neither large- nor small-scale lateralization abnormalities were observed in PCD. Further, the optic nerve projection did not depend on the presence of situs inversus. The absence of evidence for projection abnormalities in a cohort of 10 subjects with PCD, five of whom had Kartagener syndrome, underscores that misrouting of the optic nerves is not a common trait of these subjects.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Case report. Private assisted reproductive technology clinic in Japan. A couple with male factor infertility due to Kartagener's syndrome. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection using ejaculated sperm activated by pentoxifylline. Semen characteristics, sperm ultrastructure, fertilization, pregnancy, and birth after ICSI. The fertilization rate was 7 of 12 (58.3%), and the blastocyst formation rate was 4 of 7 (57.1%); all blastocysts were vitrified. After a single blastcyst transfer, a pregnancy ensued and progressed to term; a healthy female infant was delivered. With ejaculated sperm, which was activated by pentoxifylline, successful fertilization was accomplished by ICSI; thus, fertilization, vitrification, pregnancy, and delivery are attainable with sperm obtained from men with Kartagener's syndrome.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

21514598	Diagnostic value of nasal nitric oxide measured with non-velum closure techniques for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is a reliable non-invasive screening test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but the recommended technique, exhalation against resistance (ER), requires cooperation limiting its use in young children. Our objectives were to determine whether easier non-velum closure techniques have the ability to discriminate PCD and longitudinal reproducibility. We conducted a case-control study evaluating 5 breathing techniques (ER, breath hold, tidal breathing mouth open, tidal breathing mouth closed, and humming) for measuring nNO in patients with PCD compared with control subjects (cystic fibrosis [CF], non-PCD non-CF bronchiectasis, and healthy). A subgroup repeated measurements 1 month later. Sensitivity, specificity, and intraclass correlation coefficient of each nNO technique were determined. We tested 85 children (20 PCD, 32 CF, 14 broncheoctasis, and 19 healthy), aged 5 to 18 years (mean age, 11.5 years); 52% of children were male. All breathing techniques discriminated patients with PCD from control subjects with high specificity (>90%), 100% sensitivity, and intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8. nNO output cutoff values for diagnosing PCD varied with techniques (ER, 59 nL/min; breath hold, 61 nL/min; tidal breathing mouth open, 37 nL/min; tidal breathing mouth closed, 30 nL/min; humming, 41 nL/min). Non-velum closure techniques are reproducible and valid to discriminate PCD; however, they generally yield lower values than ER.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21534334	Pediatric pulmonology in a developing country: our focus	This study was designed to determine the profile of our pediatric pulmonology unit in Turkey, a developing country, by investigating the patients admitted to our unit for the first time. Our objectives were: to determine the profile of patients admitted for the first time, to compare their initial diagnoses before referral to our hospital with the diagnoses determined in our unit, to determine the definitive diagnoses for patients requiring advanced intervention with invasive diagnostic methods, and to follow the treatments, operations and invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation practices. With these objectives in mind, the records of 412 patients who visited the pediatric pulmonology clinic within a six-month period were reviewed. The referral diagnoses, consisting mostly of primary ciliary dyskinesia, recurrent lung infections caused by immune deficiency and bronchiectasis, as well as definitive diagnoses were recorded. Tuberculosis (14%), cystic fibrosis (7.8%), bronchiectasis (4.6%), immune deficiency (1.6%), hydatid cyst (2%), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (1%) were the most commonly diagnosed diseases. Final diagnosis in 145 of the 412 patients (35.2%) differed from the referral diagnosis. Consanguineous marriages are encountered more commonly in developing countries like Turkey, leading to an increased incidence of genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dysgenesis, cystic fibrosis and immune deficiencies. Infectious diseases such as hydatid cyst and tuberculosis are also common. In any country in which there is a unique distribution of diseases, in other words, a characteristic and unique disease spectrum, courses and instructional fellowship programs should be arranged accordingly.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21625832	Clinical Pearls in pediatric infections	This series of Clinical Pearls presents four cases presenting with infection. Each of these cases had clinical clues to the correct diagnosis, which could be picked up on meticulous history, clinical examination, or basic laboratory investigations. The authors highlight the important lessons to be learnt from each case. The first is a 7 year old boy with recurrent respiratory tract infections since early life. Clinical examination revealed the presence of dextrocardia and situs inversus and bronchiectasis leading to a diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. The second case is a 1.5-month-old infant who presented with meningitis and increasing head size since birth. CSF examination and CT scanning led to the correct diagnosis of congenital Toxoplasmosis. The next case is an infant with high grade fever and neck swelling. He had the rare Lemierre's syndrome comprising of oro-pharyngeal infection, suppurative thrompbophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and systemic dissemination of septic emboli. The fourth case is a 2-year-old infant with recurrent respiratory tract infections and discharging neck swellings from early life. Repeated testing for tuberculosis was negative. The diagnosis was Chronic granulomatous disease. The authors describe the clinical approach and investigations in these cases; along with an outline of the management.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21663943	Expression of nitric oxide synthases in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Nitric oxide is believed to play a central role in nonspecific defense of upper airways. Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have very low concentration of nasal nitric oxide, which may contribute to the chronic upper airway diseases encountered by these patients. The mechanisms underlying this drop of nasal nitric oxide in primary ciliary dyskinesia are still unknown. The goal of the present work was to study nitric oxide synthases expression in upper airway tissues from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. For this purpose, 5 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and 10 nonallergic age-matched patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia undergoing nasal polypectomy were included. Nasal nitric oxide concentration was measured before polypectomy, and nitric oxide synthase expression and function were studied in nasal polyps. The nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia was lower than that in patients without primary ciliary dyskinesia (13 [9-16] ppb versus 210 [167-254] ppb, P < .0001). Nitric oxide synthase 2 immunostaining was prominent at the apical part of the ciliated epithelial cells and was similar in both groups. Nitric oxide synthase 3 staining was restricted to endothelial cells in both groups. In addition, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase activity was superimposable to nitric oxide synthases 2 and 3 immunostaining, suggesting a preserved NADPH-activity of nitric oxide synthase. We therefore conclude that the drop in nasal nitric oxide in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia is not secondary to the loss of nitric oxide synthase expression.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

21684128	Primary ciliary dyskinesia: who and how to confirm the diagnosis?	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disease associated with abnormal ciliary structure and function, which results in retention of mucus and bacteria in the respiratory tract, leading to chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease from early childhood, situs abnormalities and abnormal sperm motility. The diagnosis of PCD can be difficult and is based on the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotype, evidence of abnormal ciliary function and specific ultrastructural ciliary defects identified by transmission electron microscopy. Because prognosis of the disease is related to the age of diagnosis, we suggest in this article, elements that should early orientate diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

21715716	Loss of SPEF2 function in mice results in spermatogenesis defects and primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) results from defects in motile cilia function. Mice homozygous for the mutation big giant head (bgh) have several abnormalities commonly associated with PCD, including hydrocephalus, male infertility, and sinusitis. In the present study, we use a variety of histopathological and cell biological techniques to characterize the bgh phenotype, and we identify the bgh mutation using a positional cloning approach. Histopathological, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic analyses demonstrate that the male infertility results from shortened flagella and disorganized axonemal and accessory structures in elongating spermatids and mature sperm. In addition, there is a reduced number of elongating spermatids during spermatogenesis and mature sperm in the epididymis. Histological analyses show that the hydrocephalus is characterized by severe dilatation of the lateral ventricles and that bgh sinuses have an accumulation of mucus infiltrated by neutrophils. In contrast to the sperm phenotype, electron microscopy demonstrates that mutant respiratory epithelial cilia are ultrastructurally normal, but video microscopic analysis shows that their beat frequency is lower than that of wild-type cilia. Through a positional cloning approach, we identified two sequence variants in the gene encoding sperm flagellar protein 2 (SPEF2), which has been postulated to play an important role in spermatogenesis and flagellar assembly. A causative nonsense mutation was validated by Western blot analysis, strongly suggesting that the bgh phenotype results from the loss of SPEF2 function. Taken together, the data in this study demonstrate that SPEF2 is required for cilia function and identify a new genetic cause of PCD in mice.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	2.3.

A causative nonsense mutation was validated by Western blot analysis, strongly suggesting that the bgh phenotype results from the loss of SPEF2 function. Taken together, the data in this study demonstrate that SPEF2 is required for cilia function and identify a new genetic cause of PCD in mice.
21718985	Birth of a healthy boy using fresh testicular sperm in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome	To report a case of Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome. Case report. Private IVF center. A 35-year-old man with Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome causing primary infertility. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Sperm recovery, fertilization, and live birth. Ovulation induction of the female partner, recovery of spermatozoa by TESE from the male partner and ICSI of 9 metaphase II oocytes resulted in two fertilized oocytes. The delivery of a healthy boy with normal anatomy and 46,XY karyotype was achieved after the transfer of only one 4-cell grade 1 embryo. To our knowledge, this case with nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener's syndrome is unique and demonstrates the revolutionary aspects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) concerning male factor infertility.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

21868036	Lower airway nitric oxide is increased in children with sickle cell disease	To determine alveolar and airways nitric oxide (NO) levels in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Multiple flows fractional exhaled NO (FE(NO)), bronchial NO flux (J'aw(NO)), and alveolar NO concentration (Ca(NO)) were determined prospectively in 16 non-atopic children with SCD in a tertiary ambulatory clinic and compared with those in 10 children with primary ciliary dyskinesia and 22 healthy control subjects. Differences in FE(NO), J'aw(NO), and Ca(NO) were compared with mixed model analysis and Mann-Whitney tests. Children with SCD had reference range FE(NO) at 50 mL/sec, but FE(NO) was elevated across all flows compared with healthy control subjects (mean difference=2.10±0.91 parts per billion, P=.03). Subjects with SCD had increased J'aw(NO) (1177±533 picoliters per second versus 833±343 picolitres per second, P=.03), and Ca(NO) was no different from control subjects. In contrast, children with primary ciliary dyskinesia had decreased FE(NO) (mean difference=3.36±1.24 parts per billion, P<.01) and J'aw(NO) (507±259 picoliters per second versus 833±343 picoliters per second, P<.01). Lower airways NO is increased in children with SCD. Elevation of J'aw(NO) may represent dysregulation of NO metabolism or subclinical airways inflammation.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

21907944	Development and validation of a method of cilia motility analysis for the early diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinically uniform entity, but cilia motility and structure can vary between patients, making the diagnostic difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PCD of a system of high-resolution digital high-speed video analysis with proprietary software that we developed for analysis of ciliary motility (Desinsoft-Bio 200). The secondary aim was to correlate nasal ciliary activity with clinical and structural abnormalities in PCD. We analysed nasal mucociliary transport, cilia ultrastructure, nasal ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern studied by high-resolution digital high-speed video in 25 cases of PCD (11 Kartagener syndrome), 27 secondary ciliary dyskinesia and 34 healthy volunteers. Nasal mucociliary transport was defective in both primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Ciliary immotility was observed only in 6 patients with Kartagener syndrome and correlated with the absence of dynein. We observed a correlation between partial dynein deficiencies and ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia activity and structure was normal in secondary ciliary dyskinesia. Nasal mucociliary transport showed high sensitivity for PCD diagnosis with a low specificity. High-resolution digital high-speed video has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PCD. This system of video analysis is more useful than ultrastructural study and mucociliary transport for PCD screening. Dynein absence is correlated with cilia immotility and is more common in patients with Kartagener syndrome.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22006708	Progression of lung disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia: is spirometry less accurate than CT?	Despite its extensive use, there is no evidence that spirometry is useful in the assessment of progression of lung disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We hypothesize that high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a better indicator of PCD lung disease progression than spirometry. We retrospectively evaluated two paired spirometry and HRCT examinations from 20 PCD patients (age, 11.6 years; range, 6.5-27.5 years). The evaluations were performed in stable state and during unstable lung disease. HRCT scans were scored blind by two raters. Compared to the first assessment, at the second evaluation spirometry did not change while HRCT scores significantly worsened (P < 0.01). Age was significantly related to HRCT total (r = 0.5; P = 0.02) and bronchiectasis scores (r = 0.5; P = 0.02). At both evaluations, HRCT total score correlated with FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.01; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.006; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively), and bronchiectasis score was related to FEV(1) (r = -0.5, P = 0.03; r = -0.6; P = 0.002, respectively) and FVC Z scores (r = -0.6, P = 0.008; r = -0.7, P = 0.001, respectively). No relationship was found between the change in HRCT scores and the change in spirometry. In PCD, structural lung disease may worsen despite spirometry being stable.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22102620	Static respiratory cilia associated with mutations in Dnahc11/DNAH11: a mouse model of PCD	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder causing significant upper and lower respiratory tract morbidity and impaired fertility. Half of PCD patients show abnormal situs. Human disease loci have been identified but a mouse model without additional deleterious defects is elusive. The inversus viscerum mouse, mutated at the outer arm dynein heavy chain 11 locus (Dnahc11) is a known model of heterotaxy. We demonstrated immotile tracheal cilia with normal ultrastructure and reduced sperm motility in the Dnahc11(iv) mouse. This is accompanied by gross rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis media, all indicators of human PCD. Strikingly, age-related progression of the disease is evident. The Dnahc11(iv) mouse is robust, lacks secondary defects, and requires no intervention to precipitate the phenotype. Together these findings show the Dnahc11(iv) mouse to be an excellent model of many aspects of human PCD. Mutation of the homologous human locus has previously been associated with hyperkinetic tracheal cilia in PCD. Two PCD patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure, one with immotile and one with hyperkinetic cilia were found to carry DNAH11 mutations. Three novel DNAH11 mutations were detected indicating that this gene should be investigated in patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure and static, as well as hyperkinetic cilia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

22121832	Cardiopulmonary assessment in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive disorder of ciliary dysfunction associated with lung involvement, which has a great impact on health. There is limited information concerning the aerobic fitness of children and adolescents with PCD. The aim of this study was to assess cardiopulmonary functional capacity and its relationship with pulmonary function and physical activity (PA) levels in patients with PCD. Ten patients with PCD (age 13·2 ± 2·8 years) underwent spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. PA was investigated through a questionnaire. Eight age- and body mass index-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Main variables were forced expiratory volume at 1 s, peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak) ) and time spent in PA. Forty per cent of patients with PCD had impaired lung function as expressed by FEV(1) < 85% predicted. Only patients with impaired lung function exhibited reduced VO(2peak) (18·1 ± 7·9 mL/kg/min). Time spent in total daily PA was slightly lower in patients than controls, with no difference between patients with normal or reduced lung function. In multiple regression models, male gender (β = 0·518, P = 0·018), age (β = 0·752, P = 0·035) and time spent in vigorous PA (β = 0·353, P = 0·049) were independent predictors of aerobic fitness. Assessment of resting pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary functional capacity could contribute to the evaluation of pulmonary impairment in PCD. Given the benefit of physical exercise on airway clearance and on general health and quality of life, patients with PCD should be encouraged to adopt an active lifestyle.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22135026	Twenty-year review of quantitative transmission electron microscopy for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	The examination of ciliary ultrastructure in a nasal sample remains a definitive diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The quantitative assessment of ciliary ultrastructure in the diagnosis of PCD over a 20-year period was reviewed. During this period, 1182 patients were referred for ciliary ultrastructural analysis, 242 (20%) of whom were confirmed as having the disease. The two main causes of PCD identified were a lack of outer dynein arms (43%) and a lack of both inner and outer dynein arms (24%). Other causes included transposition, radial spoke and inner dynein arm defects. No specific ultrastructural defects were detected in 33 patients (3%) diagnosed as having PCD on the basis of their clinical features and screening tests that included a low nasal nitric oxide concentration or slow saccharine clearance and abnormal ciliary beat frequency or pattern. Electron microscopy analysis can confirm but does not always exclude a diagnosis of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22157010	Functional architecture of the outer arm dynein conformational switch.	Dynein light chain 1 (LC1/DNAL1) is one of the most highly conserved components of ciliary axonemal outer arm dyneins, and it associates with both a heavy chain motor unit and tubulin located within the A-tubule of the axonemal outer doublet microtubules. In a variety of model systems, lack of LC1 or expression of mutant forms leads to profound defects in ciliary motility, including the failure of the hydrodynamic coupling needed for ciliary metachronal synchrony, random stalling during the power/recovery stroke transition, an aberrant response to imposed viscous load, and in some cases partial failure of motor assembly. These phenotypes have led to the proposal that LC1 acts as part of a mechanical switch to control motor function in response to alterations in axonemal curvature. Here we have used NMR chemical shift mapping to define the regions perturbed by a series of mutations in the C-terminal domain that yield a range of phenotypic effects on motility. In addition, we have identified the subdomain of LC1 involved in binding microtubules and characterized the consequences of an Asn → Ser alteration within the terminal leucine-rich repeat that in humans causes primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together, these data define a series of functional subdomains within LC1 and allow us to propose a structural model for the organization of the dynein heavy chain-LC1-microtubule ternary complex that is required for the coordinated activity of dynein motors in cilia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

22416021	Effectiveness of sequencing selected exons of DNAH5 and DNAI1 in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetically heterogenous condition. Mutations in DNAH5 or DNAI1 genes can be found in about a third of the patients with PCD. Increased occurrence of mutations was described in several exons of these long genes. The objective of the study was to test the sensitivity of sequencing of selected 13 exons (as compared to costly sequencing of all 100 exons of the two genes), and to determine the prevalence of the DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations in the Czech PCD database. The Czech national PCD database has identified 31 pediatric patients, diagnosed based on clinical findings and tests on the ciliated epithelium. Twenty-seven patients from 24 families agreed on genetic testing. In the first step, direct sequencing of selected 13 exons (9 of DNAH5 and 4 of DNAI1) was performed, and then we compared its effectiveness in detecting at least one mutation with results of sequencing all 100 exons of the two genes. The sequencing of all exons identified compound heterozygosity for PCD mutations in nine patients from eight families (DNAH5 in eight and DNAI1 in one patient), and heterozygozity for a DNAH5 mutation of uncertain functional significance in one additional patient. The first step of selected exon sequencing detected a mutation in five out of these eight families, its actual sensitivity being 62.5%, with a high predictive value. The phenotypic and clinical characteristics of all the paediatric patients with PCD are shown. Selected exon sequencing detects at least one mutated allele in over a half of our patients who have PCD due to DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutations. To lower the costs of the genetic testing, targeted step-wise genetic testing may be a reasonable approach to detect mutations in PCD patients, especially if their phenotype is taken into account.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

22538046	Forgotten T-tube in the middle ear	Retention within the middle ear cleft is an unusual complication of T-tube insertion. A 40-year-old woman with Kartagener's Syndrome presented with hearing impairment in the right ear. She was found to have a previously inserted Goode T-tube lying within the middle ear behind an intact drum. She underwent successful removal of the T-tube via a myringotomy, and a new tube was re-inserted. Migration of a T-tube into the middle ear cleft should always be kept in mind in patients who present with otological symptoms and have a history of T-tube insertion, even in the presence of an intact drum.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

22551925	An unusual regression of the symptoms of Kartagener syndrome	Kartagener's syndrome is a rare autosomal-recessive genetic disease with progressive damage of the respiratory system and situs inversus. Although the management of patients with Kartagener's syndrome remains uncertain and evidence is limited, it is important to follow up these patients with an adequate and shared care system. This report presents a clinical case of Kartagener's syndrome in a 25-year-old woman. Computed tomography showed dextrocardia and bronchiectasis. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound confirmed situs inversus totalis. After 7 years, good treatment results were achieved: lung function improved and radiological findings showed no changes. The present case discusses the complex interrelationship between the genetic variation and a proper nonspecific management of Kartagener's syndrome.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

22570319	Longitudinal lung function and structural changes in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Functional and structural lung evaluations are part of the follow-up of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We aimed to evaluate transversal and longitudinal relationships between lung function test (LFT) and chest computed tomography (CT) in children with PCD, in stable clinical condition. Data from children followed in the French National Center were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were (i) definitive diagnosis of PCD, (ii) age less than 15 years at the beginning of follow-up, (iii) at least 8 years of follow-up, (iv) at least two couples of concurrent CT and LFT available in a phase of clinical stability of the lung disease without modification of the treatment regimen in the last 4 weeks. Twenty children (median age at entry 4.6 years, median follow-up 15.4 years) were included. Concurrent LFT (blood gas and spirometry) and CT (score) results were recorded. LFT indices (PaO(2) (n = 210), FVC, FEV(1) , FEF(2575%) (n = 195)) significantly decreased with age, and the mean annual decrease (z-score (% predicted)) was -0.17 (-0.49%), -0.09 (-0.50%), -0.10 (-0.89%), and -0.07 (-1.73%), respectively. First CT (median age 8.7 years) revealed bronchiectasis (70%), mucous plugging (70%), peribronchial thickening (90%), parenchymal abnormalities (65%), and hyperinflation (50%). CT scores (n = 74) significantly increased with age, and was negatively correlated to PaO(2), FVC, FEV(1), and FEF(2575%) longitudinal changes. In stable clinical condition, functional, and structural progressive impairments significantly correlated in children with PCD. Further prospective studies, including large populations of patients with various levels of disease severity, are needed to confirm whether lung function follow-up can be used to adjust CT frequency and help at minimizing the radiation burden in children with a good life expectancy.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22693285	Delineation of CCDC39/CCDC40 mutation spectrum and associated phenotypes in primary ciliary dyskinesia	CCDC39 and CCDC40 genes have recently been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects and axonemal disorganisation; their contribution to the disease is, however, unknown. Aiming to delineate the CCDC39/CCDC40 mutation spectrum and associated phenotypes, this study screened a large cohort of patients with IDA defects, in whom clinical and ciliary phenotypes were accurately described. All CCDC39 and CCDC40 exons and intronic boundaries were sequenced in 43 patients from 40 unrelated families. The study recorded and compared clinical features (sex, origin, consanguinity, laterality defects, ages at first symptoms and at phenotype evaluation, neonatal respiratory distress, airway infections, nasal polyposis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, infertility), ciliary beat frequency, and quantitative ultrastructural analyses of cilia and sperm flagella. Biallelic CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations were identified in 30/34 (88.2%) unrelated families with IDA defects associated with axonemal disorganisation (22 and eight families, respectively). Fourteen of the 28 identified mutations are novel. No mutation was found in the six families with isolated IDA defects. Patients with identified mutations shared a similar phenotype, in terms of both clinical features and ciliary structure and function. The sperm flagellar ultrastructure, analysed in 4/7 infertile males, showed evidence of abnormalities similar to the ciliary ones. CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations represent the major cause of PCD with IDA defects and axonemal disorganisation. Patients carrying CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations are phenotypically indistinguishable. CCDC39 and CCDC40 analyses in selected patients ensure mutations are found with high probability, even if clinical or ciliary phenotypes cannot prioritise one analysis over the other.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

22888088	RPGR mutations might cause reduced orientation of respiratory cilia	RPGR gene encodes retinitis pigmentosa guanosine triphosphatase regulator protein, mutations of which cause 70% of the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) cases. Rarely, RPGR mutations can also cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a multisystem disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and male subfertility. Two patients with PCD\_RP and their relatives were analyzed using DNA sequencing, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), photometry, and high-speed videomicroscopy. The Polish patient carried a previously known c.154G>A substitution (p.Gly52Arg) in exon 2 (known to affect splicing); the mutation was co-segregating with the XLRP symptoms in his family. The c.824 G>T mutation (p. Gly275Val) in the Australian patient was a de novo mutation. In both patients, TEM and IF did not reveal any changes in the respiratory cilia structure. However, following ciliogenesis in vitro, in contrast to the ciliary beat frequency, the ciliary beat coordination in the spheroids from the Polish proband and his relatives carrying the c.154G>A mutation was reduced. Analysis of the ciliary alignment indicated severely disturbed orientation of cilia. Therefore, we confirm that defects in the RPGR protein may contribute to syndromic PCD. Lack of ultrastructural defects in respiratory cilia of the probands, the reduced ciliary orientation and the decreased coordination of the ciliary bundles observed in the Polish patient suggested that the RPGR protein may play a role in the establishment of the proper respiratory cilia orientation.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

22890535	Kartagener's syndrome--anaesthetic considerations for ENT surgery	Kartagener's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder presenting a triad of sinusitis, bronchicetasis and situs inversus with dextrocardia. It occurs in 50% of patients with situs inversus. The most important anesthetic implications of Kartegener's syndrome surgery are assessement of pulmonary and cardiac structure and function. We present a case of 43-year-old woman with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and bilateral sectetory otitis media. The chest radiograph and CT scans showed dextrocardia and situs inversus with chronic bronchitis without bronchiectasis. Spirometry showed forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.66 L and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.62 L. Electroechography showed no cardiac abnormalities with 55-60% of EF. The anesthetic implications of Kartagener's syndrome are varied. The regional or general anesthesia might be involved with sinus surgery, ear surgery, pulmonary surgery, infertility or abdominal and cardiac surgery. The main anesthetic considerations among patients with Kartagener's syndrome are related to the pulmonary function which include preoperative respiratory infections due to bronchiectasis. We should also monitor potentially occluded congenital heart diseases. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare disease and when the patient need an operation we have to consider surgery with regional or general anesthesia. The general anesthesia would be safe after complete preanaesthetic examination of the patient. The ECG, chest CT scans, spirometry and echocardiography are mandatory before the operation.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

23144323	Human airway ciliary dynamics	Airway cilia depend on precise changes in shape to transport the mucus gel overlying mucosal surfaces. The ciliary motion can be recorded in several planes using video microscopy. However, cilia are densely packed, and automated computerized systems are not available to convert these ciliary shape changes into forms that are useful for testing theoretical models of ciliary function. We developed a system for converting planar ciliary motions recorded by video microscopy into an empirical quantitative model, which is easy to use in validating mathematical models, or in examining ciliary function, e.g., in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The system we developed allows the manipulation of a model cilium superimposed over a video of beating cilia. Data were analyzed to determine shear angles and velocity vectors of points along the cilium. Extracted waveforms were used to construct a composite waveform, which could be used as a standard. Variability was measured as the mean difference in position of points on individual waveforms and the standard. The shapes analyzed were the end-recovery, end-effective, and fastest moving effective and recovery with mean (± SE) differences of 0.31(0.04), 0.25(0.06), 0.50(0.12), 0.50(0.10), μm, respectively. In contrast, the same measures for three different PCD waveforms had values far outside this range.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY + INFORMATICS	2.1.

23232004	The Cough Cylinder: a tool to study measures against airborne spread of (myco-) bacteria	'Covering your cough' reduces droplet number, but its effect on airborne pathogen transmission is less clear. The World Health Organization specifically recommends cough etiquette to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but implementation is generally poor and evidence supporting its value is lacking. We constructed a model to assess 'real life' transmission risk by counting viable pathogens from aerosols produced by coughing patients, thus allowing the assessment of outward protection measures in a standardised fashion. During the validation process, we focused on rod-shaped bacteria as surrogates for M. tuberculosis. The Cough Cylinder enabled us to sample Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and mycobacteria from aerosols produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and tuberculosis. Pathogens in droplets and in airborne particles could be sampled. Delayed air sampling allowed specific measurement of persistent airborne particles. This novel experimental system allows measurement of aerosol pathogen spread in a highly standardised fashion. It also offers the possibility to assess the impact of different interventions to limit aerosol transmission.	primary ciliary dyskinesia			203	The Cough Cylinder: a tool to study measures against airborne spread of (myco-) bacteria.

23292041	Ciliary ultrastructure in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and primary ciliary dyskinesia	The Cilia represent one of the main mechanisms contributing to the clearance of microorganisms and particles from the respiratory epithelium. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically determined disorder characterized by irreversible systemic dysmotility of the cilia. Secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD) differs from primary defects on the reversible ultrastructural alterations that can occur after any insult to a previously normal mucosa. Hence, this study aimed to describe and compare the main ultrastructural ciliary features in PCD and SCD through transmission electron microscopy. The most frequent PCD abnormalities were missing or short dynein arms, missing central microtubules, and displacement of one of the nine peripheral doublets. The most common changes found in SCD were compound cilia and peripheral microtubule alterations associated with modifications of the respiratory epithelium. PCD presented a higher percentage of altered cilia (>30 %) when compared to SCD (5 %), demonstrating that SCD is more limited in area than PCD. Whereas in PCD the changes in the dynein arms and in the central microtubules are fundamental for diagnostic confirmation, the diagnosis of SCD usually involves compound cilia and disarrangements in peripheral microtubules.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

23299155	Significance of fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurements in detecting primary ciliary dyskinesia in Saudi children	To examine the usefulness of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurements in detecting primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in children. This observational study was conducted at the Department of Pediatrics and Physiology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from January 2011 to December 2011. The study population consisted of 22 children with symptoms suggestive of PCD and the diagnosis was confirmed by ciliary biopsy. Using the American Thoracic Society guidelines, measurements of FENO were performed in 22 subjects with proven PCD biopsies and in 11 healthy age-matched subjects. No significant differences were found on the basis of age or ventilatory function tests between the PCD patients and control groups. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide values were significantly lower in children with PCD (6.19+/-1.43) compared to control group (17.00+/-6.30) (CI: -14.854 to -5.927, p<0.0001). Rhinorrhea was seen in 7 (31.8%), recurrent acute otitis media in 16 (72.7%), chronic otitis media in 5 (22.7%), recurrent sinusitis in 5 (22.7%), chronic productive cough in 8 (36.4%), bronchospasm in 11 (50%), and dextrocardia in 3 (13.6%) subjects. There was no correlation between age, FENO, and ventilatory function parameters. The measurement of FENO appears to be a useful tool for screening children for PCD. It can complement other tests such as nasal biopsy and electron microscopy studies.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

23351276	ciliaFA: a research tool for automated, high-throughput measurement of ciliary beat frequency using freely available software	Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz. Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal (frequency range 34 to 52 Hz) and respiratory epithelial cells (frequency 3 to 18 Hz) were captured using a high-speed digital video recorder. To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system. The overall mean difference (± SD) between the ciliaFA and direct measurement high-speed digital imaging methods was -0.05 ± 1.25 Hz, the correlation coefficient was shown to be 0.991 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from -1.99 to 1.49 Hz for respiratory and from -2.55 to 3.25 Hz for ependymal cilia. A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) using Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias. We have included free access to the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY + INFORMATICS		378	ciliaFA: a research tool for automated, high-throughput measurement of ciliary beat frequency using freely available software. Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming.

23354437	The nexin-dynein regulatory complex subunit DRC1 is essential for motile cilia function in algae and humans	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by dysfunction of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella and random determination of visceral asymmetry. Here, we identify the DRC1 subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), an axonemal structure critical for the regulation of dynein motors, and show that mutations in the gene encoding DRC1, CCDC164, are involved in PCD pathogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations disrupting DRC1 result in severe defects in assembly of the N-DRC structure and defective ciliary movement in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and humans. Our results highlight a role for N-DRC integrity in regulating ciliary beating and provide the first direct evidence that mutations in DRC genes cause human disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

23418344	Sperm-associated antigen-17 gene is essential for motile cilia function and neonatal survival	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting from defects in cilia assembly or motility, is caused by mutations in a number of genes encoding axonemal proteins. PCD phenotypes are variable, and include recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, hydrocephaly, situs inversus, and male infertility. We generated knockout mice for the sperm-associated antigen-17 (Spag17) gene, which encodes a central pair (CP) protein present in the axonemes of cells with ""9 + 2"" motile cilia or flagella. The targeting of Spag17 resulted in a severe phenotype characterized by immotile nasal and tracheal cilia, reduced clearance of nasal mucus, profound respiratory distress associated with lung fluid accumulation and disruption of the alveolar epithelium, cerebral ventricular expansion consistent with emerging hydrocephalus, failure to suckle, and neonatal demise within 12 hours of birth. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the loss of one CP microtubule in approximately one quarter of tracheal cilia axonemes, an absence of a C1 microtubule projection, and other less frequent CP structural abnormalities. SPAG6 and SPAG16 (CP proteins that interact with SPAG17) were increased in tracheal tissue from SPAG17-deficient mice. We conclude that Spag17 plays a critical role in the function and structure of motile cilia, and that neonatal lethality is likely explained by impaired airway mucociliary clearance."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

23437356	Hand-held tidal breathing nasal nitric oxide measurement--a promising targeted case-finding tool for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement is an established first line test in the work-up for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Tidal breathing nNO (TB-nNO) measurements require minimal cooperation and are potentially useful even in young children. Hand-held NO devices are becoming increasingly widespread for asthma management. Therefore, we chose to assess whether hand-held TB-nNO measurements reliably discriminate between PCD, and Healthy Subjects (HS) and included Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients as a disease control group known to have intermediate nNO levels. In this cross sectional, single centre, single occasion, proof-of-concept study in children and adults with PCD and CF, and in HS we compared feasibility, success rates, discriminatory capacity, repeatability and agreement between a hand-held electrochemical device equipped with a nNO software application sampling at flow rates 2 ml/s or 5 ml/s, and two stationary chemiluminescence devices, applying both tidal breathing and velum closure techniques. Measurements were done in 16 PCD patients, 21 patients with CF and 20 HS aged between 3.8 and 60.9 years. Hand-held TB-nNO showed high success rate (96.5-100%) vs. velum closure nNO techniques (70.2-89.5%). Hand-held TB-nNO sampling at flow rate 5 ml/s showed equally high discriminative power (PCD vs. HS [p<0.0001] and PCD vs. CF [p<0.0001]) and reaching close to 100% sensitivity and specificity, superior repeatability (CV% = 10%) and equal limits of agreement compared to TB-nNO by stationary devices and even compared to velum closure sampling. Hand-held TB-nNO discriminates significantly between PCD, CF and HS and shows promising potential as a widespread targeted case-finding tool for PCD, although further studies are warranted before implementation.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

23772318	A rare case of respiratory disorders associated with two autosomal recessive diseases and male infertility	The study of nasal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and ultrastructure may contribute to the understanding of pathognomonic cases of male infertility associated with defects in sperm motility. This study was designed to report a particular case of male infertility, characterized by the association of two respiratory autosomal recessive genetic diseases (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency [AAT-D] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]). A 39-year-old patient with complete sperm immotility, AAT-D, and bronchiectasis was studied in the Laboratory of Male Fertility, the Department of Urology, the Respiratory Center of a Pediatric Hospital, and in the Department of Clinical Medicine of a Rehabilitation Respiratory Hospital. Family history, physical examination, hormonal analysis, microbial assays, semen analysis, nasal ciliary function, and structure study by digital high-speed video photography and transmission electron microscopy are described. A noninvasive nasal biopsy to retrieve ciliated epithelium lining the inferior surface of the inferior nasal turbinates was performed and CBF was determined. Beat pattern was slightly curved and rigid, not wide, and metacronic in all the observed fields analyzed. CBF was 8.2 Hz in average (reference value, 10-15 Hz) Ultrastructural assay revealed absence of the inner dynein arms in 97% of the cilia observed. The final infertility accurate diagnosis was achieved by the study of nasal CBF and ultrastructure contributing to the patient health management and genetic counseling while deciding fatherhood. Beyond this particular case, the present report may open a new field of studies in male infertility, mainly in cases of asthenozoospermia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

23798057	Founder mutation in RSPH4A identified in patients of Hispanic descent with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by ciliary dysfunction resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, respiratory distress in term neonates, laterality (situs) defects, and bronchiectasis. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities seen by electron microscopy. Mutations in radial spoke head proteins occur in PCD patients with central apparatus defects. Advances in genetic testing have been crucial in addressing the diagnostic challenge. Here, we describe a novel splice-site mutation (c.921+3_6delAAGT) in RSPH4A, which leads to a premature translation termination signal in nine subjects with PCD (seven families). Loss-of-function was confirmed with quantitative ciliary ultrastructural analysis, measurement of ciliary beat frequency and waveform, and transcript analysis. All nine individuals carrying c.921+3_6delAAGT splice-site mutation in RSPH4A were Hispanic with ancestry tracing to Puerto Rico. This mutation is a founder mutation and a common cause of PCD without situs abnormalities in patients of Puerto Rican descent.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

23872636	DYX1C1 is required for axonemal dynein assembly and ciliary motility	DYX1C1 has been associated with dyslexia and neuronal migration in the developing neocortex. Unexpectedly, we found that deleting exons 2-4 of Dyx1c1 in mice caused a phenotype resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic airway disease, laterality defects and male infertility. This phenotype was confirmed independently in mice with a Dyx1c1 c.T2A start-codon mutation recovered from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. Morpholinos targeting dyx1c1 in zebrafish also caused laterality and ciliary motility defects. In humans, we identified recessive loss-of-function DYX1C1 mutations in 12 individuals with PCD. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analyses of DYX1C1-mutant motile cilia in mice and humans showed disruptions of outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs, respectively). DYX1C1 localizes to the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells, its interactome is enriched for molecular chaperones, and it interacts with the cytoplasmic ODA and IDA assembly factor DNAAF2 (KTU). Thus, we propose that DYX1C1 is a newly identified dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF4).	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24055112	Mutations in SPAG1 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with defective outer and inner dynein arms	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 20 genes, but collectively they account for only ∼65% of all PCDs. To identify mutations in additional genes that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on three unrelated probands with ciliary outer and inner dynein arm (ODA+IDA) defects. Mutations in SPAG1 were identified in one family with three affected siblings. Further screening of SPAG1 in 98 unrelated affected individuals (62 with ODA+IDA defects, 35 with ODA defects, 1 without available ciliary ultrastructure) revealed biallelic loss-of-function mutations in 11 additional individuals (including one sib-pair). All 14 affected individuals with SPAG1 mutations had a characteristic PCD phenotype, including 8 with situs abnormalities. Additionally, all individuals with mutations who had defined ciliary ultrastructure had ODA+IDA defects. SPAG1 was present in human airway epithelial cell lysates but was not present in isolated axonemes, and immunofluorescence staining showed an absence of ODA and IDA proteins in cilia from an affected individual, thus indicating that SPAG1 probably plays a role in the cytoplasmic assembly and/or trafficking of the axonemal dynein arms. Zebrafish morpholino studies of spag1 produced cilia-related phenotypes previously reported for PCD-causing mutations in genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins. Together, these results demonstrate that mutations in SPAG1 cause PCD with ciliary ODA+IDA defects and that exome sequencing is useful to identify genetic causes of heterogeneous recessive disorders.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24091606	Differences in disease expression between primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis with and without pancreatic insufficiency	Impaired mucociliary clearance causes pulmonary disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Although the sinopulmonary disease is similar, morbidity and mortality are different. Both patients with PCD and patients with CF with pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS) show no nutrient malabsorption and are diagnosed at a later age compared with patients with CF with pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI). Clinical status, microbiology, FEV1, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans presented as total Brody score (CT-TBS) were compared for patients with PCD, CF-PI, and CF-PS, all treated at the same medical center, by the same team, and by a similar routine follow-up. One hundred sixty-four patients, 34 with PCD, 88 with CF-PI, and 42 with CF-PS were enrolled. PCD was diagnosed at a similar age as CF-PS but significantly later than CF-PI. Mean FEV1 % predicted was similar for the three groups. The rate of FEV1 change with age in PCD was similar to CF-PS but significantly lower than in CF-PI. Severity of structural lung disease (CT-TBS) was similar for PCD and CF-PS and significantly higher in CF-PI. No correlation between TBS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and FEV1 in PCD was seen, whereas a negative correlation with FEV1 was observed for both CF groups. Although in our study PCD was similar to CF-PS, the lack of correlation between FEV1 and age, CT-TBS, and P aeruginosa infection in PCD suggests that impaired mucociliary clearance is not the only cause for inducing pulmonary damage in these diseases. Furthermore, a comparison of disease characteristics for PCD and CF should distinguish between CF-PI and CF-PS as different entities.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

Clinical status, microbiology, FEV1, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans presented as total Brody score (CT-TBS) were compared for patients with PCD, CF-PI, and CF-PS, all treated at the same medical center, by the same team, and by a similar routine follow-up. One hundred sixty-four patients, 34 with PCD, 88 with CF-PI, and 42 with CF-PS were enrolled. PCD was diagnosed at a similar age as CF-PS but significantly later than CF-PI. Mean FEV1 % predicted was similar for the three groups. The rate of FEV1 change with age in PCD was similar to CF-PS but significantly lower than in CF-PI. Severity of structural lung disease (CT-TBS) was similar for PCD and CF-PS and significantly higher in CF-PI. No correlation between TBS or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and FEV1 in PCD was seen, whereas a negative correlation with FEV1 was observed for both CF groups. Although in our study PCD was similar to CF-PS, the lack of correlation between FEV1 and age, CT-TBS, and P aeruginosa infection in PCD suggests that impaired mucociliary clearance is not the only cause for inducing pulmonary damage in these diseases. Furthermore, a comparison of disease characteristics for PCD and CF should distinguish between CF-PI and CF-PS as different entities.
24092478	Acute hypoxemia in a parturient with primary ciliary dyskinesia following the administration of intravenous oxytocin: a case report	We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

24094744	Zebrafish Ciliopathy Screen Plus Human Mutational Analysis Identifies C21orf59 and CCDC65 Defects as Causing Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused when defects of motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, male infertility, and situs abnormalities. Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia function remain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an in vivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24150548	A novel mutation of DNAH5 in chronic rhinosinusitis and primary ciliary dyskinesia in a Chinese family	The genetic factors underlying the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) remains unclear. We herein identified four related subjects with CRS and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) from geographically disperse Chinese Han communities and performed exome capture and sequencing of one affected individual and unaffected parents. We found a novel mutation in DNAH5 (c. 8030G>A) in CRS and PCD which was different from those attributed to cystic fibrosis and a defect of cilia motility in a Chinese family through exome capture and sequencing. Our findings showed that c. 8030G>A of DNAH5 may be implicated as the disease-causing gene of CRS and PCD in this Chinese family, which may expand the understanding of clinicians on the pathogenesis of CRS. Moreover, the identification of this novel mutation in DNAH5 indirectly indicates that exome capture and sequencing are beneficial in the genetic research of midget consanguinity families.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24226769	The heterotaxy gene GALNT11 glycosylates Notch to orchestrate cilia type and laterality	Heterotaxy is a disorder of left-right body patterning, or laterality, that is associated with major congenital heart disease. The aetiology and mechanisms underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals. The mechanism that specifies these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a patient with heterotaxy, and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11 activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1 signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch, establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for human heterotaxy.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24236100	Reduced nasal nitric oxide production in cystic fibrosis patients with elevated systemic inflammation markers	Nitric oxide (NO) is produced within the respiratory tract and can be detected in exhaled bronchial and nasal air. The concentration varies in specific diseases, being elevated in patients with asthma and bronchiectasis, but decreased in primary ciliary dyskinesia. In cystic fibrosis (CF), conflicting data exist on NO levels, which are reported unexplained as either decreased or normal. Functionally, NO production in the paranasal sinuses is considered as a location-specific first-line defence mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between upper and lower airway NO levels and blood inflammatory parameters, CF-pathogen colonisation, and clinical data. Nasal and bronchial NO concentrations from 57 CF patients were determined using an electrochemical analyser and correlated to pathogen colonisation of the upper and lower airways which were microbiologically assessed from nasal lavage and sputum samples. Statistical analyses were performed with respect to clinical parameters (lung function, BMI), laboratory findings (CRP, leucocytes, total-IgG, fibrinogen), and anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapy. There were significant correlations between nasal and bronchial NO levels (rho = 0.48, p<0.001), but no correlation between NO levels and specific pathogen colonisation. In patients receiving azithromycin, significantly reduced bronchial NO and a tendency to reduced nasal NO could be found. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation of nasal NO to CRP (rho = -0.28, p = 0.04) and to leucocytes (rho = -0.41, p = 0.003) was observed. In contrast, bronchial NO levels showed no correlation to clinical or inflammatory parameters. Given that NO in the paranasal sinuses is part of the first-line defence mechanism against pathogens, our finding of reduced nasal NO in CF patients with elevated systemic inflammatory markers indicates impaired upper airway defence. This may facilitate further pathogen acquisition in the sinonasal area, with consequences for lung colonisation and the overall outcome in CF.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Kartagener syndrome (KS) is a clinical variant of primary ciliary dyskinesia which is involved in situs inversus associated with chronic respiratory infections. In addition, glomerular disease in KS syndrome is rare and reported cases are limited. We had a 27-year-old female patient with KS who presented with proteinuria, hematuria, normal kidney function, and a family history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Kidney biopsy showed segmental scar with adhesion to Bowman capsule, which was indicative of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

24360805	Mutations in DNAH1, which encodes an inner arm heavy chain dynein, lead to male infertility from multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella	Ten to fifteen percent of couples are confronted with infertility and a male factor is involved in approximately half the cases. A genetic etiology is likely in most cases yet only few genes have been formally correlated with male infertility. Homozygosity mapping was carried out on a cohort of 20 North African individuals, including 18 index cases, presenting with primary infertility resulting from impaired sperm motility caused by a mosaic of multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) including absent, short, coiled, bent, and irregular flagella. Five unrelated subjects out of 18 (28%) carried a homozygous variant in DNAH1, which encodes an inner dynein heavy chain and is expressed in testis. RT-PCR, immunostaining, and electronic microscopy were carried out on samples from one of the subjects with a mutation located on a donor splice site. Neither the transcript nor the protein was observed in this individual, confirming the pathogenicity of this variant. A general axonemal disorganization including mislocalization of the microtubule doublets and loss of the inner dynein arms was observed. Although DNAH1 is also expressed in other ciliated cells, infertility was the only symptom of primary ciliary dyskinesia observed in affected subjects, suggesting that DNAH1 function in cilium is not as critical as in sperm flagellum.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24388318	Prevalence of and associations with allergic rhinitis in children with chronic rhinosinusitis	Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in children has been associated with a variety of disorders including atopic disease, cystic fibrosis, immunologic disorders and ciliary dyskinesia. Although a strong association, or even cause and effect relationship, between allergic rhinitis (AR) and CRS is commonly assumed, the epidemiologic relationship between these disorders has not yet been defined in children. A retrospective review of all children diagnosed with CRS on otolaryngology or allergy office evaluation at a large tertiary-care pediatric hospital over a ten-year period was performed. Demographic data and concomitant diagnoses of AR, cystic fibrosis, immunologic disorders and primary ciliary dyskinesia were analyzed for relationships with CRS. A total of 4044 children with an average age of 8.9 years and a slight male predominance (53.8%) with CRS were identified. Of these children, 0.2% had primary ciliary dyskinesia, 4.1% had cystic fibrosis, 12.3% had an immunologic disorder, and 26.9% had AR. A concomitant asthma diagnosis was positively associated with a diagnosis of AR (OR=6.24, 95% CI: 5.27-7.39, P<0.001), whereas a concomitant cystic fibrosis diagnosis was negatively associated (OR=0.12, 95% CI: 0.06-0.26, P<0.001). AR is more prevalent than the other comorbidities combined in children with CRS, and is independently associated with the presence of asthma. Formal allergy testing, guided by clinical history and regional allergen sensitivity prevalence, should be strongly considered in all children with CRS, in particular those with reactive airway disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

24420929	Multicenter analysis of body mass index, lung function, and sputum microbiology in primary ciliary dyskinesia	No studies longitudinally, simultaneously assessed body mass index (BMI) and spirometry in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We determined BMI and spirometry in 158 PCD children and adolescents from London, UK (n = 75), Naples, Italy (n = 23) and Copenhagen, Denmark (n = 60) at first presentation and during follow-up. Annual BMI and spirometry were prospectively collected and analyzed over blocks of 2, 4, and 6 consecutive years. Sputum pathogens were recorded. Age at first spirometry was 8.7 years (range, 4.2-17.4). Mean Z scores of first measured BMI, FEV1, FVC, and FEF(25-75) were 0.01, -1.37, -0.84, and -1.68, respectively. First spirometry was not more frequently impaired in patients referred at age ≥6 years than in those referred at preschool age (P = 0.13). There were no differences in slopes for BMI, FEV1, FVC, or FEF(25-75) over any time block. H. influenzae was the most common pathogen, isolated at least once in 65% of patients. P. aeruginosa was found in 58 subjects (37%) of whom 8 (5%) were chronically infected. Neither pathogens was associated with spirometry changes. Preschool referral to a PCD center was not associated with better spirometry or BMI. PCD children and adolescents receiving centralized care show steady BMI and spirometry during medium term follow-up. There was a high prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, but the evolution of spirometry or BMI was not affected by this microorganism in medium term. Despite our longitudinal analysis showed no differences between the three centers, the assessment of spirometry and BMI over time represents a quality improvement tool. Future studies are needed to highlight the role of spirometry and BMI in long term PCD management and identify subgroups of patients with a higher risk of early lung failure or nutritional problems.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

24450482	Primary ciliary dyskinesia: critical evaluation of clinical symptoms and diagnosis in patients with normal and abnormal ultrastructure	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disorder with variable disease progression. To date, mutations in more than 20 different genes have been found. At present, PCD subtypes are described according to the ultrastructural defect on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the motile cilia. PCD with normal ultrastructure (NU) is rarely reported because it requires additional testing. Biallelic mutations in DNAH11 have been described as one cause of PCD with NU.The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD, in relation to the ultrastructural defect. Additionally, we aimed to demonstrate the need for biopsy and cell culture to reliably diagnose PCD, especially the NU subtype. We retrospectively analyzed data from 206 patients with PCD. We compared the clinical characteristics, lung function, microbiology and imaging results of 68 patients with PCD and NU to those of 90 patients with dynein deficiencies and 41 patients with central pair abnormalities. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the robustness of the diagnosis of the NU subtype in cell culture by data from genetic analysis. PCD with NU comprised 33% (68/206) of all patients with PCD. Compared to other subtypes, patients with PCD and NU had a similar frequency of upper and lower respiratory tract problems, as well as similar lung function and imaging. With the currently widely applied approach, without cell culture, the diagnosis would have been missed in 16% (11/68) of patients with NU. Genetic analysis was performed in 29/68 patients with PCD and NU, and biallelic mutations were found in 79% (23/29) of tested patients. We reported on the clinical characteristics of a large population of patients with PCD and NU. We have shown that systematic performance of biopsy and cell culture increases sensitivity to detect PCD, especially the subtype with NU.PCD with NU has similar clinical characteristics as other PCD types and requires biopsy plus ciliogenesis in culture for optimal diagnostic yield.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

We have shown that systematic performance of biopsy and cell culture increases sensitivity to detect PCD, especially the subtype with NU.PCD with NU has similar clinical characteristics as other PCD types and requires biopsy plus ciliogenesis in culture for optimal diagnostic yield.
24451115	Restoring ciliary function to differentiated primary ciliary dyskinesia cells with a lentiviral vector	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogenous autosomal recessive disease in which mutations disrupt ciliary function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and life-long lung disease. Mouse tracheal cells with a targeted deletion in the axonemal dynein intermediate chain 1 (Dnaic1) gene differentiate normally in culture but lack ciliary activity. Gene transfer to undifferentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with avian influenza hemagglutinin restored Dnaic1 expression and ciliary activity. Importantly, apical treatment of well-differentiated cultures of mouse Dnaic1(-/-) cells with lentiviral vector also restored ciliary activity, demonstrating successful gene transfer from the apical surface. Treatment of Dnaic1(flox/flox) mice expressing an estrogen-responsive Cre recombinase with different doses of tamoxifen indicated that restoration of ∼20% of ciliary activity may be sufficient to prevent the development of rhinosinusitis. However, although administration of a β-galactosidase-expressing vector into control mice demonstrated efficient gene transfer to the nasal epithelium, treatment of Dnaic1(-/-) mice resulted in a low level of gene transfer, demonstrating that the severe rhinitis present in these animals impedes gene transfer. The results demonstrate that gene replacement therapy may be a viable treatment option for PCD, but further improvements in the efficiency of gene transfer are necessary.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.3.

24454367	Impaired Growth during Childhood in Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) leads to recurrent/chronic respiratory infections, resulting in chronic inflammation and potentially in chronic pulmonary disease with bronchiectasis. We analyzed longitudinal data on body length/height and body mass index (BMI) for 29 children and young adults with PCD aging 1.5-24 years (median, 14.5) who had been diagnosed at the age of 0.5-17 years (median, 8). Of these, 10 carried pathogenic mutations in either DNAH5 or DNAI1. In children with PCD, body length/height progressively decreased from +0.40 ± 0.24 SDS (the 1st birthday), +0.16 ± 0.23 SDS (3 years old), and -0.13 ± 0.21 SDS (5 years old) to -0.54 ± 0.19 SDS (7 years old; P = 0.01 versus 0), -0.67 ± 0.21 SDS (9 years old; P = 0.005 versus 0), -0.52 ± 0.24 SDS (11 years old; P = 0.04 versus 0), and -0.53 ± 0.23 SDS (13 years old; P = 0.03 versus 0). These results reflect low growth rates during the childhood growth period. Thereafter, heights stabilized up to the age of 17 years. The growth deterioration was not dependent on sex or disease severity but was more pronounced in DNAH5 or DNAI1 mutation carriers. BMI did not differ from population standards, which suggests that nutritional deficits are not the cause of growth delay. We conclude that PCD leads to chronic deprivation with significant growth deterioration during childhood.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

24498942	The role of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of motile cilia. The diagnosis of PCD has previously relied on ciliary analysis with transmission electron microscopy or video microscopy. However, patients with PCD may have normal ultrastructural appearance, and ciliary analysis has limited accessibility. Alternatively, PCD can be diagnosed by demonstrating biallelic mutations in known PCD genes. Genetic testing is emerging as a diagnostic tool to complement ciliary analysis where interpretation and access may delay diagnosis. To determine the diagnostic yield of genetic testing of patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of PCD in a multiethnic urban center. Twenty-eight individuals with confirmed PCD on transmission electron microscopy of ciliary ultrastructure and 24 individuals with a probable diagnosis of PCD based on a classical PCD phenotype and low nasal nitric oxide had molecular analysis of 12 genes associated with PCD. Of 49 subjects who underwent ciliary biopsy, 28 (57%) were diagnosed with PCD through an ultrastructural defect. Of the 52 individuals who underwent molecular genetic analysis, 22 (42%) individuals had two mutations in known PCD genes. Twenty-four previously unreported mutations in known PCD genes were observed. Combining both diagnostic modalities of biopsy and molecular genetics, the diagnostic yield increased to 69% compared with 57% based on biopsy alone. The diagnosis of PCD is challenging and has traditionally relied on ciliary biopsy, which is unreliable as the sole criterion for a definitive diagnosis. Molecular genetic analysis can be used as a complementary test to increase the diagnostic yield.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

24516614	Ciliary genes are down-regulated in bronchial tissue of primary ciliary dyskinesia patients	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, bronchiectasis and male infertility. The pulmonary phenotype in PCD is caused by the impaired motility of cilia in the respiratory epithelium, due to ultrastructural defects of these organelles. We hypothesized that defects of multi-protein ciliary complexes should be reflected by gene expression changes in the respiratory epithelium. We have previously found that large group of genes functionally related to cilia share highly correlated expression pattern in PCD bronchial tissue. Here we performed an explorative analysis of differential gene expression in the bronchial tissue from six PCD patients and nine non-PCD controls, using Illumina HumanRef-12 Whole Genome BeadChips. We observed 1323 genes with at least 2-fold difference in the mean expression level between the two groups (t-test p-value <0.05). Annotation analysis showed that the genes down-regulated in PCD biopsies (602) were significantly enriched for terms related to cilia, whereas the up-regulated genes (721) were significantly enriched for terms related to cell cycle and mitosis. We assembled a list of human genes predicted to encode ciliary proteins, components of outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, radial spokes, and intraflagellar transport proteins. A significant down-regulation of the expression of genes from all the four groups was observed in PCD, compared to non-PCD biopsies. Our data suggest that a coordinated down-regulation of the ciliome genes plays an important role in the molecular pathomechanism of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

24533546	Coexistence of two rare genetic disorders: Kartagener syndrome and familial Mediterranean fever	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease, predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessive, with ciliary dysfunction leading to impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic airway infection and inflammation. Situs inversus totalis occurs in ~50 % of PCD patients and it is known as Kartagener syndome. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and peritonitis, pleuritis, arthritis, or erysipelas-like skin disease. FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene which is located on chromosome 16p13.3. p.M680I, p.M694 V, p.M694I, p.V726A on exon 10 and p.E148Q on exon 2 are the most common mutations among FMF patients and these constitute 85 % of all. Homozygosity of R202Q polymorphism is strongly associated with FMF. We would like to present a case of Kartagener syndrome accompanied by FMF with R202Q polymorphism. Our case is the first in the literature indicating the accidental coexistence of FMF and Kartagener syndrome.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

24554765	hemingway is required for sperm flagella assembly and ciliary motility in Drosophila	Cilia play major functions in physiology and development, and ciliary dysfunctions are responsible for several diseases in humans called ciliopathies. Cilia motility is required for cell and fluid propulsion in organisms. In humans, cilia motility deficiencies lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, with upper-airways recurrent infections, left-right asymmetry perturbations, and fertility defects. In Drosophila, we identified hemingway (hmw) as a novel component required for motile cilia function. hmw encodes a 604-amino acid protein characterized by a highly conserved coiled-coil domain also found in the human orthologue, KIAA1430. We show that HMW is conserved in species with motile cilia and that, in Drosophila, hmw is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and spermatozoa. We created hmw-knockout flies and found that they are hearing impaired and male sterile. hmw is implicated in the motility of ciliated auditory sensory neurons and, in the testis, is required for elongation and maintenance of sperm flagella. Because HMW is absent from mature flagella, we propose that HMW is not a structural component of the motile axoneme but is required for proper acquisition of motile properties. This identifies HMW as a novel, evolutionarily conserved component necessary for motile cilium function and flagella assembly.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2. NORMAL BIOLOGY	2.3.

24742509	Clinical characteristics of primary ciliary dyskinesia	To analyze the clinical characteristics of primary ciliary dyskinesia(PCD) so as to improve the diagnostic level of this rarely seen disease. Ten patients with PCD were retrospectively reviewed, the medical history, symptoms, signs, lung CT or chest X-ray, rhino-sinus CT scan, nasal nitric oxide (NO) levels, nasal ciliary ultrastructure, DNAH5 and DNAH11 genetic mutation, as well as treatment outcome were analyzed. All 10 patients had recurrent chronic sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis/bronchiectasis since childhood. Nine cases with translocation of heart and big vessels were diagnosed as Kartagener syndrome. One woman was suffering from barrenness and one man sterility after marriage for long time without birth control. Nasal NO levels were significantly lower in 2 patients with PCD but it was almost normal in one patient. Ciliary ultrastructure investigated by transmission electron microscope were almost normal in 4 cases without missing of inner or outer dynein arms. Two cases taking exome capture sequencing showed that mutations happened in DNAH5 and DNAH11. Five subjects underwenting sanger sequencing on 6 common exon fragments of DNAH5 and DNAH11 did not show any abnormality. Ten cases took medication therapy, while 5 patients once underwent functional endoscope sinus surgery. All of the 10 patients had improvement of their symptoms and signs after treatment. The PCD is so rare in clinic that it is easily misdiagnosed.

24753481	Mannose-binding lectin 2 gene polymorphism and lung damage in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in innate immunity and has been reported to be associated with the age-related decline in lung function in cystic fibrosis. MBL polymorphisms are associated with lung function decline in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). We performed sputum microbiology, spirometry pre- and post-administration of salbutamol, ciliary motion analysis, ultrastructural assessment of cilia, ciliogenesis in culture, and chest high resolution computed tomography in children with a clinical history of respiratory tract infections and/or presence of bronchiectasis suggestive of PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). All subjects were evaluated for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding MBL-2. The diagnosis of PCD was established in 45 subjects, while in the remaining 53 the diagnosis was SCD. A significant bronchodilator response was observed only in PCD associated with the MBL2-3 genotype, which is known to be associated with low/undetectable MBL serum levels. Also, bronchiectasis severity was significantly greater in subjects with MBL2-3 in both PCD and SCD. No other association was found between MBL genotypes and clinical findings. MBL plays a relatively minor role as a disease modifier in PCD. A similar finding in SCD supports the likely significance of this result.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

A mutation in a new causative gene (CCDC39) has been identified in the Old English Sheepdog (OES). To describe the clinical findings and the molecular changes of affected dogs and estimate the worldwide prevalence of the mutation in a large cohort of OES. 578 OES, including 28 affected and 550 clinically healthy dogs. This retrospective study reviewed the data of OES diagnosed with PCD and OES tested for the mutation. Clinical data including results of physical examination and further investigations were obtained on 11/28 dogs. CCDC39 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis in affected dogs and healthy dogs. DNA was extracted on 561/578 dogs and a genetic test by Taqman technology was developed to genotype the CCDC39 mutation in these dogs. Clinical findings were recurrent nasal discharge and cough, pyrexia, leucocytosis, and bronchopneumonia. Ultrastructural defects were characterized by central microtubular abnormalities and decreased number of inner dynein arms (IDAs). Molecular analysis revealed a reduced expression of CCDC39 RNA and an absence of CCDC39 protein in affected dogs compared to healthy dogs. The mutation was more frequent in nonrandomly selected European OES population with a higher proportion of carriers (19%) compared to non-European dogs (7%). CCDC39 mutation is dispersed in a worldwide population and is responsible for PCD in this breed. Genetic testing might enable control of this disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

24824133	Unexpected genetic heterogeneity for primary ciliary dyskinesia in the Irish Traveller population	We present a study of five children from three unrelated Irish Traveller families presenting with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). As previously characterized disorders in the Irish Traveller population are caused by common homozygous mutations, we hypothesised that all three PCD families shared the same recessive mutation. However, exome sequencing showed that there was no pathogenic homozygous mutation common to all families. This finding was supported by histology, which showed that each family has a different type of ciliary defect; transposition defect (family A), nude epithelium (family B) and absence of inner and outer dynein arms (family C). Therefore, each family was analysed independently using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The affected siblings in family A share a novel 1 bp duplication in RSPH4A (NM\_001161664.1:c.166dup; p.Arg56Profs_11), a radial-spoke head protein involved in ciliary movement. In family B, we identified three candidate genes (CCNO, KCNN3 and CDKN1C), with a 5-bp duplication in CCNO (NM021147.3:c.258262dup; p.Gln88Argfs_8) being the most likely cause of ciliary aplasia. This is the first study to implicate CCNO, a DNA repair gene reported to be involved in multiciliogenesis, in PCD. In family C, we identified a ∼3.5-kb deletion in DYX1C1, a neuronal migration gene previously associated with PCD. This is the first report of a disorder in the relatively small Irish Traveller population to be caused by >1 disease gene. Our study identified at least three different PCD genes in the Irish Traveller population, highlighting that one cannot always assume genetic homogeneity, even in small consanguineous populations.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

In family B, we identified three candidate genes (CCNO, KCNN3 and CDKN1C), with a 5-bp duplication in CCNO (NM021147.3:c.258262dup; p.Gln88Argfs_8) being the most likely cause of ciliary aplasia. This is the first study to implicate CCNO, a DNA repair gene reported to be involved in multiciliogenesis, in PCD. In family C, we identified a ∼3.5-kb deletion in DYX1C1, a neuronal migration gene previously associated with PCD. This is the first report of a disorder in the relatively small Irish Traveller population to be caused by >1 disease gene. Our study identified at least three different PCD genes in the Irish Traveller population, highlighting that one cannot always assume genetic homogeneity, even in small consanguineous populations.
25048963	MCIDAS mutations result in a mucociliary clearance disorder with reduced generation of multiple motile cilia.	Reduced generation of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) is a rare mucociliary clearance disorder. Affected persons suffer from recurrent infections of upper and lower airways because of highly reduced numbers of multiple motile respiratory cilia. Here we report recessive loss-of-function and missense mutations in MCIDAS-encoding Multicilin, which was shown to promote the early steps of multiciliated cell differentiation in Xenopus. MCIDAS mutant respiratory epithelial cells carry only one or two cilia per cell, which lack ciliary motility-related proteins (DNAH5; CCDC39) as seen in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Consistent with this finding, FOXJ1-regulating axonemal motor protein expression is absent in respiratory cells of MCIDAS mutant individuals. CCNO, when mutated known to cause RGMC, is also absent in MCIDAS mutant respiratory cells, consistent with its downstream activity. Thus, our findings identify Multicilin as a key regulator of CCNO/FOXJ1 for human multiciliated cell differentiation, and highlight the 5q11 region containing CCNO and MCIDAS as a locus underlying RGMC.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

25139857	Systematic discovery of novel ciliary genes through functional genomics in the zebrafish	Cilia are microtubule-based hair-like organelles that play many important roles in development and physiology, and are implicated in a rapidly expanding spectrum of human diseases, collectively termed ciliopathies. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), one of the most prevalent of ciliopathies, arises from abnormalities in the differentiation or motility of the motile cilia. Despite their biomedical importance, a methodical functional screen for ciliary genes has not been carried out in any vertebrate at the organismal level. We sought to systematically discover novel motile cilia genes by identifying the genes induced by Foxj1, a winged-helix transcription factor that has an evolutionarily conserved role as the master regulator of motile cilia biogenesis. Unexpectedly, we find that the majority of the Foxj1-induced genes have not been associated with cilia before. To characterize these novel putative ciliary genes, we subjected 50 randomly selected candidates to a systematic functional phenotypic screen in zebrafish embryos. Remarkably, we find that over 60% are required for ciliary differentiation or function, whereas 30% of the proteins encoded by these genes localize to motile cilia. We also show that these genes regulate the proper differentiation and beating of motile cilia. This collection of Foxj1-induced genes will be invaluable for furthering our understanding of ciliary biology, and in the identification of new mutations underlying ciliary disorders in humans.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

25178347	Primary ciliary dyskinesia diagnosed by electron microscopy in one case of Kartagener syndrome	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is associated with abnormalities in the structure of a function of motile cilia, causing impairment of muco-ciliary clearence, with bacterial overinfection of the upper and lower respiratory tract (chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease), heterotaxia (situs abnormalities), with/without congenital heart disease, abnormal sperm motility with male infertility, higher frequency of ectopic pregnancy and female subfertility. The presence of recurrent respiratory tract infections in the pediatric age requires differentiation between primary immunodeficiency, diseases with abnormal mucus (e.g., cystic fibrosis) and abnormal ciliary diseases. This case was hospitalized for recurrent respiratory tract infections and total situs inversus at the age of five years, which has enabled the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome. The PCD confirmation was performed by electron microscopy examination of nasal mucosa cells through which were confirmed dynein arms abnormalities. The diagnosis and early treatment of childhood PCD allows a positive development and a good prognosis, thus improving the quality of life.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Although congenital ciliary defect is recognised as the main cause of this syndrome, it remains difficult to treat the associated airway infection. A 17-year-old female patient presented with repeated refractory airway infection. She also had bronchiectasis and situs inversus. Electron microscopic evaluation of her nasal mucosa revealed ciliary defect and confirmed the diagnosis of KS. She underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) followed by long-term postoperative debridement of the sinonasal cavity. This treatment reduced chronic rhinosinusitis and protected against subsequent airway infection in a 7-year follow-up. FESS is effective for relieving both chronic rhinosinusitis and lung infection of KS in the long term.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

PCD is also a genetically heterogeneous disorder with many single gene mutations leading to similar clinical phenotypes. Here, we present a novel PCD causal gene, coiled-coil domain containing 151 (CCDC151), which has been shown to be essential in motile cilia of many animals and other vertebrates but its effects in humans was not observed until currently. We observed a novel nonsense mutation in a homozygous state in the CCDC151 gene (NM\_145045.4:c.925G>T:p.[E309\*]) in a clinically diagnosed PCD patient from a consanguineous family of Arabic ancestry. The variant was absent in 238 randomly selected individuals indicating that the variant is rare and likely not to be a founder mutation. Our finding also shows that given prior knowledge from model organisms, even a single whole-exome sequence can be sufficient to discover a novel causal gene.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

25226371	Peripheral vestibular dysfunction in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia: abnormal otoconial development?	Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) have absent or reduced otoconial function compared to the normal population. Investigations in zebrafish show that ciliation is important for the development of the otolith organs, but this has never been evaluated in humans. PCD is a congenital defect of ciliary structure. We undertook a pilot study to determine whether patients with PCD have absent or reduced otoconial function compared to the normal population. Vestibular function testing, including utricular centrifugation (UCF) testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and electronystagmography, was undertaken in five patients with known PCD. Patients also completed validated questionnaires regarding subjective balance function and symptoms. There were markedly reduced or unobtainable VEMPs bilaterally in three of the five subjects and unilaterally in the remaining two subjects. No subject had a pathological UCF asymmetry, but three subjects showed utricular abnormalities. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) at 0.25 Hz sinusoidal rotation was normal in all subjects. There were no subjective dizzy symptoms or balance issues. We speculate that the reduced saccular and utricular function in PCD patients observed in this pilot study suggests a relationship between cilia structure and/or motility, and otoconia seeding and/or positioning. Further investigation is warranted.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25232951	HEATR2 plays a conserved role in assembly of the ciliary motile apparatus	Cilia are highly conserved microtubule-based structures that perform a variety of sensory and motility functions during development and adult homeostasis. In humans, defects specifically affecting motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, infertility and laterality defects in the genetically heterogeneous disorder Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Using the comparatively simple Drosophila system, in which mechanosensory neurons possess modified motile cilia, we employed a recently elucidated cilia transcriptional RFX-FOX code to identify novel PCD candidate genes. Here, we report characterization of CG31320/HEATR2, which plays a conserved critical role in forming the axonemal dynein arms required for ciliary motility in both flies and humans. Inner and outer arm dyneins are absent from axonemes of CG31320 mutant flies and from PCD individuals with a novel splice-acceptor HEATR2 mutation. Functional conservation of closely arranged RFX-FOX binding sites upstream of HEATR2 orthologues may drive higher cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during early motile ciliogenesis. Immunoprecipitation reveals HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2, but not HSP70 or HSP90, distinguishing it from the client/chaperone functions described for other cytoplasmic proteins required for dynein arm assembly such as DNAAF1-4. These data implicate CG31320/HEATR2 in a growing intracellular pre-assembly and transport network that is necessary to deliver functional dynein machinery to the ciliary compartment for integration into the motile axoneme.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

25299134	Ciliary inclusion disease: report of a new primary ciliary dyskinesia variant	Biopsies from 6 children with clinical presentations suggestive of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) displayed respiratory epithelial cells with disorganized accumulations of basal bodies within the cytoplasm and large intracytoplasmic vesicles into which projected numerous microvilli and cilia. Microvilli, but few cilia, were present at the cell surface. Ultrastructural study revealed a variety of nonspecific abnormalities but demonstrated the cilia generally to be morphologically normal, suggesting that the cause of cilia malfunction was not any recognized primary cause or secondary effect. Repeat studies from 2 patients produced similar findings. It is proposed that this entity, termed ciliary inclusion disease, represents a variant form of PCD manifesting as a consequence of improper ciliogenesis caused by inhibited cytoskeleton-regulated migration of basal bodies to the luminal surface of the airway respiratory epithelial cells.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.1.

25302410	Airway ciliary dysfunction and sinopulmonary symptoms in patients with congenital heart disease	Patients with congenital heart disease with heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal airway ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide, characteristics associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a reflection of the role of motile cilia in airway clearance and left-right patterning. To assess the potential broader clinical significance of airway ciliary dysfunction in congenital heart disease, we assessed the prevalence of ciliary dysfunction versus respiratory symptoms in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease were recruited (n = 218), 39 with heterotaxy. Nasal nitric oxide measurements and nasal biopsies for ciliary motion video microscopy were conducted. Sinopulmonary symptoms were reviewed by questionnaire. A high prevalence of ciliary motion defects (51.8%) and low or borderline low nasal nitric oxide levels (35.5%) were observed in patients with congenital heart disease with or without heterotaxy. Patients with ciliary motion defects or low nasal nitric oxide showed increased sinopulmonary symptoms, with most respiratory symptoms seen in those with both abnormal ciliary motion and low nitric oxide. Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide were more important in determining risk of sinopulmonary symptoms than heterotaxy status. Patients with congenital heart disease without heterotaxy exhibit a high prevalence of abnormal ciliary motion and low nasal nitric oxide. This was associated with more sinopulmonary symptoms. These findings suggest that patients with a broad spectrum of congenital heart disease and respiratory symptoms may benefit from screening for ciliary dysfunction and implementation of medical interventions to reduce sinopulmonary morbidities.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare condition attributed to cilia dysfunction. Murine models of BBS suggest a respiratory phenotype; however, no reports have studied the translation of these findings in patients. We assessed the clinical symptoms of motile cilia dysfunction and the histology of ciliated respiratory epithelium in patients with BBS. We report an increased prevalence of neonatal respiratory distress at birth (12%), general practitioner-diagnosed asthma (21%), otitis media (33%), and rhinitis (36%) in patients with BBS. These symptoms, however, occurred at a significantly reduced prevalence compared with patients with known motile cilia dysfunction (primary ciliary dyskinesia). Respiratory epithelial assessment revealed cellular damage, significant ciliary depletion (on 60% of ciliated cells), and goblet cell hyperplasia in patients with BBS (50% goblet cells). These findings were quantifiably similar to those of patients with asthma (P > .05). Surprisingly, motile cilia function and ultrastructure were grossly normal with the exception of occasional unique inclusions within the ciliary membrane. In conclusion, motile ciliary structure and function are essentially normal in patients with BBS.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25386990	Cilia dysfunction in lung disease	A characteristic feature of the human airway epithelium is the presence of ciliated cells bearing motile cilia, specialized cell surface projections containing axonemes composed of microtubules and dynein arms, which provide ATP-driven motility. In the airways, cilia function in concert with airway mucus to mediate the critical function of mucociliary clearance, cleansing the airways of inhaled particles and pathogens. The prototypical disorder of respiratory cilia is primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder that leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, to repeated chest infections, and to the progressive destruction of lung architecture. Numerous acquired lung diseases are also marked by abnormalities in both cilia structure and function. In this review we summarize current knowledge regarding airway ciliated cells and cilia, how they function to maintain a healthy epithelium, and how disorders of cilia structure and function contribute to inherited and acquired lung disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

25422025	Primary ciliary dyskinesia and neonatal respiratory distress	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease affecting motile cilia lining the respiratory tract. Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25469542	A human laterality disorder associated with a homozygous WDR16 deletion	The laterality in the embryo is determined by left-right asymmetric gene expression driven by the flow of extraembryonic fluid, which is maintained by the rotary movement of monocilia on the nodal cells. Defects manifest by abnormal formation and arrangement of visceral organs. The genetic etiology of defects not associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the cause of situs anomalies, including heterotaxy syndrome and situs inversus totalis, in a consanguineous family. Whole-exome analysis revealed a homozygous deleterious deletion in the WDR16 gene, which segregated with the phenotype. WDR16 protein was previously proposed to play a role in cilia-related signal transduction processes; the rat Wdr16 protein was shown to be confined to cilia-possessing tissues and severe hydrocephalus was observed in the wdr16 gene knockdown zebrafish. The phenotype associated with the homozygous deletion in our patients suggests a role for WDR16 in human laterality patterning. Exome analysis is a valuable tool for molecular investigation even in cases of large deletions.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		189	A human laterality disorder associated with a homozygous WDR16 deletion. The laterality in the embryo is determined by left-right asymmetric gene expression driven by the flow of extraembryonic fluid, which is maintained by the rotary movement of monocilia on the nodal cells. Defects manifest by abnormal formation and arrangement of visceral organs. The genetic etiology of defects not associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the cause of situs anomalies, including heterotaxy syndrome and situs inversus totalis, in a consanguineous family.

25473808	Cryo-electron tomography reveals ciliary defects underlying human RSPH1 primary ciliary dyskinesia	Cilia play essential roles in normal human development and health; cilia dysfunction results in diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite their importance, the native structure of human cilia is unknown, and structural defects in the cilia of patients are often undetectable or remain elusive because of heterogeneity. Here we develop an approach that enables visualization of human (patient) cilia at high-resolution using cryo-electron tomography of samples obtained noninvasively by nasal scrape biopsy. We present the native 3D structures of normal and PCD-causing RSPH1-mutant human respiratory cilia in unprecedented detail; this allows comparisons of cilia structure across evolutionarily distant species and reveals the previously unknown primary defect and the heterogeneous secondary defects in RSPH1-mutant cilia. Our data provide evidence for structural and functional heterogeneity in radial spokes, suggest a mechanism for the milder RSPH1 PCD phenotype and demonstrate that cryo-electron tomography can be applied to human disease by directly imaging patient samples.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25489202	Kartagener's syndrome: a classical case	Recurrent lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a very common problem we encounter in our clinical practice. Failure to recognize the specific cause of this condition may subject the patients to unnecessary and inappropriate treatment. among the various causes of recurrent LRTI, the most frequent causes are abnormalities of general or local impairment of immune mechanism and abnormalities of cilia or mucus of respiratory tract. We report an adult case of recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections since childhood along with situs inversus totalis which was diagnosed as Kartagener's syndrome. He had all the classical clinical and radiological features of Kartagener's syndrome which is a rare inherited disorder which is seen in nearly half of the cases of primary cilliary dyskinesia (PCD). One should always keep in mind the possibilities of Kartagener's syndrome in patients presenting with recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, sinusitis or bronchiectasis. Inability to diagnose this condition may subject the patient to unnecessary and repeated hospital admissions, investigations and treatment failure.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25562561	A 15-year old girl with asthma and lower lobe bronchiectasis	Wet cough, wheeze, and sputum in an adolescent with evidence for bronchiectasis is an uncommon presentation. The differential diagnosis includes cystic fibrosis (CF), immunodeficiency disorders, complement deficiency, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin disease, repeated aspiration pneumonia, foreign body, bronchial carcinoid, unresolved right middle lobe pneumonia, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The likely diagnosis proceeds from the more to less common in patients with these symptoms. The location of disease on computed tomography scanning, nasal and bronchial exhaled nitric oxide, identification of ultrastructural defects on electron microscopy, and specific genetic mutation help separate CF and PCD. Although differentiating these conditions is vital, the chronic management of the bronchiectasis usually includes clearance mechanisms, bronchodilators, regular exercise, appropriate vaccinations, and judicious antibiotics for airway infections.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25731630	Technical and practical issues for tidal breathing measurements of nasal nitric oxide in children	To promote early screening of patients with suspected Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurements during tidal breathing (TB) have been developed for children unable to ensure velum closure (VC) during breath hold or expiration against resistance. To investigate technical and practical issues related to TB-nNO methods in children referred for suspected or asserted PCD, we recorded, in a prospective multicenter study, TB-nNO (calculated as the mean of 5 peaks, 10 or 30 sec during tidal breathing) and VC-nNO when available. We studied 142 children (PCD diagnosis asserted in 47, excluded in 39). Nasal NO values were significantly different according to methods, VC-nNO being higher than TB-nNO (TB-nNO 5 peaks higher than mean of 10 or 30 sec). Specificity (90-94%) and sensitivity (86-97%) were similar between TB-nNO and VC-nNO methods. Age was more correlated with VC-nNO than with TB-nNO. TB-nNO could differ between the two nostrils by more than 10% (or 10 ppb when nNO absolute value lower 100 ppb) in 32-43% of the tested children, according to the different tidal breathing values, and was reproducible in the long term but influenced by ambient NO. Despite TB-nNO values being lower than VC-nNO, TB-nNO was found to be as discriminant for PCD, and probably more discriminant in children less than 8 years old, as the VC method. These results were obtained using the chemiluminescence technique which allows an easier assessment of relevant factors such as nasal permeability and ambient NO than the electrochemical technique.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

25764361	Clinical analysis of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia in mainland China	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetic disorder featured with dysfunctional motility of cilia. Clinical presentations of PCD include situs inversus, repeated respiratory tract infections, otitis media, sinusitis and infertility. This study aims to provide clinical strategies on diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Clinical data of seven patients diagnosed as PCD in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were analyzed. We also extracted data from other cases in mainland China from the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database by the end of 2012. A total of 127 cases of PCD were summarized and analyzed in this study. Seven patients in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were finally confirmed to have PCD. All of them had clinical history of recurrent respiratory infection. Imaging analysis showed varying degrees of bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests in four patients showed combined obstructive and restrictive patterns. Three cases were confirmed to have PCD by electron microscopy. We then further extracted information from literature for those 127 PCD patients in mainland China. All of them had chronic respiratory infection. Seven cases were complicated with recurrent otitis media and 15 cases were complicated with infertility. A total of 119 patients were diagnosed with situs inversus totalis (94%). Among those 127 patients, only 9 patients' diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy. Four patients received sinus resection, and one patient received pulmonary lobectomy due to recurrent hemoptysis. One patient died of massive hemoptysis. Being a rare disease and easily confused with uncomplicated bronchiectasis, PCD diagnosis warrants particular attention. Recurrent respiratory infection, especially situs inversus could be the most important indicator of this disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.5.

A previously reported missense mutation in the CTSC gene (NM\_001814.4:c.899G>A:p.(G300D)) was identified in a homozygous state in two siblings diagnosed with PLS in a consanguineous family of Arabic ancestry. The variant was initially identified in a heterozygous state in a PLS unaffected sibling whose whole exome had been sequenced as part of a previous Primary ciliary dyskinesia study. Using this information, a proxy molecular diagnosis was made on the PLS affected siblings after consent was given to study this second disorder found to be segregating within the family. The prevalence of the mutation was then assayed in the local population using a representative sample of 256 unrelated individuals. The variant was absent in all subjects indicating that the variant is rare in Saudi Arabia. This family study illustrates how whole-exome sequencing can generate findings and inferences beyond its primary goal.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

25802884	Carrier frequencies of eleven mutations in eight genes associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder that results from functional and ultrastructural abnormalities of motile cilia. Patients with PCD have diverse clinical phenotypes that include chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections, situs inversus, heterotaxy with or without congenital heart disease, and male infertility, among others. In this report, the carrier frequencies for eleven mutations in eight PCD-associated genes (DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11, CCDC114, CCDC40, CCDC65, and C21orf59) that had been found in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent were investigated in order to advise on including them in existing clinical mutation panels for this population. Results showed relatively high carrier frequencies for the DNAH5 c.7502G>C mutation (0.58%), the DNAI2 c.1304G>A mutation (0.50%), and the C21orf59 c.735C>G mutation (0.48%), as well as lower frequencies for mutations in DNAI1, CCDC65, CCDC114, and DNAH11 (0.10-0.29%). These results suggest that several of these genes should be considered for inclusion in carrier screening panels in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.4. EPIDEMIOLOGY	2.1.

25887861	Hypovitaminosis D: a novel finding in primary ciliary dyskinesia	A relationship between low levels of serum vitamin D and respiratory infections has been established. No study has examined the frequency and clinical relevance of vitamin D deficiency in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Vitamin D levels were measured in 22 PCD patients (7 females, 10.5 years, range, 2-34 years). In PCD, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), sputum microbiology, self-reported physical activity (PA) level, and quality of life (QoL) by means of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), were also assessed. Seventy-two percent of PCD patients were vitamin-D deficient-to-insufficient and 28% were sufficient. No differences in PFTs parameters were found between vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups. Patients with vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency had significantly higher SGRQ total scores, and thus poorer QoL (p = 0.03). Seventy-nine percent of PCD subjects had limitations in performing vigorous activities, and 53% performed less than 3 hours of PA per week. Vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency and sufficiency groups did not show any differences in age at PCD diagnosis or at onset of respiratory symptoms, BMI, atopy, current asthma or bronchiectasis. However, 79% of patients with bronchiectasis had vitamin D deficiency-to-insufficiency. No differences were found in the rate of positive sputum cultures and in the number of antibiotic courses between the two groups. Hypovitaminosis D is common in PCD patients, and is associated with poorer QoL. We recommend the assessment and treatment of hypovitaminosis D to be included in the routine management of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.2.

Here we describe our search to delineate the molecular basis in two affected sisters with clinically diagnosed PCD from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family, in which all known genes have been excluded. A homozygosity mapping-based approach was utilized that ultimately identified one single affected-shared region of homozygosity using 10 additional unaffected family members. A plausible candidate gene was directly sequenced and analyzed for mutations. A novel homozygous missense aberration (p.Lys1154Gln) was identified in both sisters in the DNAH1 gene that segregated completely with the disease phenotype. Further confirmation of this interesting variant was provided by exome-wide analysis in the proband.

25979076	Continuous mucociliary transport by primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro	Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is an important innate defense mechanism that continuously removes inhaled pathogens and particulates from the airways. Normal MCC is essential for maintaining a healthy respiratory system, and impaired MCC is a feature of many airway diseases, including both genetic (cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia) and acquired (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis) disorders. Research into the fundamental processes controlling MCC, therefore, has direct clinical application, but has been limited in part due to the difficulty of studying this complex multicomponent system in vitro. In this study, we have characterized a novel method that allows human airway epithelial cells to differentiate into a mucociliary epithelium that transports mucus in a continuous circular track. The mucociliary transport device allows the measurement and manipulation of all features of mucociliary transport in a controlled in vitro system. In this initial study, the effect of ciliary beat frequency and mucus concentration on the speed of mucociliary transport was investigated.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

26139845	Whole-Exome Sequencing and Targeted Copy Number Analysis in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting from loss of normal ciliary function. Symptoms include neonatal respiratory distress, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, situs inversus, and infertility. Clinical features may be subtle and highly variable, making the diagnosis of PCD challenging. The diagnosis can be confirmed with ciliary ultrastructure analysis and/or molecular genetic testing of 32 PCD-associated genes. However, because of this genetic heterogeneity, comprehensive molecular genetic testing is not considered the standard of care, and the most efficient molecular approach has yet to be elucidated. Here, we propose a cost-effective and time-efficient molecular genetic algorithm to solve cases of PCD. We conducted targeted copy number variation (CNV) analysis and/or whole-exome sequencing on 20 families (22 patients) from a subset of 45 families (52 patients) with a clinical diagnosis of PCD who did not have a molecular genetic diagnosis after Sanger sequencing of 12 PCD-associated genes. This combined molecular genetic approach led to the identification of 4 of 20 (20%) families with clinically significant CNVs and 7 of 20 (35%) families with biallelic pathogenic mutations in recently identified PCD genes, resulting in an increased molecular genetic diagnostic rate of 55% (11/20). In patients with a clinical diagnosis of PCD, whole-exome sequencing followed by targeted CNV analysis results in an overall molecular genetic yield of 76% (34/45).	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5.

The umbilicus placement of the device allows the avoidance of any visible scars. Kartagener syndrome is a rare genetic disorder (1:15 000) accompanied by the combination of chronic sinusitis/bronchiectasis leading to respiratory insufficiency and situs inversus totalis (SIT) in half of the patients.

26246169	Automated identification of abnormal respiratory ciliary motion in nasal biopsies	"Motile cilia lining the nasal and bronchial passages beat synchronously to clear mucus and foreign matter from the respiratory tract. This mucociliary defense mechanism is essential for pulmonary health, because respiratory ciliary motion defects, such as those in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or congenital heart disease, can cause severe sinopulmonary disease necessitating organ transplant. The visual examination of nasal or bronchial biopsies is critical for the diagnosis of ciliary motion defects, but these analyses are highly subjective and error-prone. Although ciliary beat frequency can be computed, this metric cannot sensitively characterize ciliary motion defects. Furthermore, PCD can present without any ultrastructural defects, limiting the use of other detection methods, such as electron microscopy. Therefore, an unbiased, computational method for analyzing ciliary motion is clinically compelling. We present a computational pipeline using algorithms from computer vision and machine learning to decompose ciliary motion into quantitative elemental components. Using this framework, we constructed digital signatures for ciliary motion recognition and quantified specific properties of the ciliary motion that allowed high-throughput classification of ciliary motion as normal or abnormal. We achieved >90% classification accuracy in two independent data cohorts composed of patients with congenital heart disease, PCD, or heterotaxy, as well as healthy controls.

Rare diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), cystic fibrosis (CF) or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) can be easily missed at the general practitioner (GP). To develop and test a questionnaire-based and data mining-supported tool providing diagnostic support for selected pulmonary diseases. First, interviews with parents of affected children were conducted and analysed. These parental observations during the pre-diagnostic time formed the basis for a new questionnaire addressing the parents' view on the disease. Secondly, parents with a sick child (e.g. PCD, PBB) answered the questionnaire and a data base was set up. Finally, a computer program consisting of eight different classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy rule-based, random forest, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and nearest neighbour) and an ensemble classifier was developed and trained to categorise any given new questionnaire and suggest a diagnosis. For estimating the diagnostic accuracy, we applied ten-fold stratified cross validation. All questionnaires of patients suffering from CF, asthma (AS), PCD, acute bronchitis (AB) and the healthy control group were correctly diagnosed by the fusion algorithm. For the pneumonia (PM) group 19/21 (90.5%) and for the PBB group 17/18 (94.4%) correct diagnoses could be reached. The program detected the correct diagnoses with an overall sensitivity of 98.8%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses confirmed the accuracy of this diagnostic tool. Case studies highlighted the applicability of the tool in the daily work of a GP. For children with symptoms of pulmonary diseases a questionnaire-based diagnostic support tool using data mining techniques exhibited good results in arriving at diagnostic suggestions. In the hands of a doctor, this tool could be of value in arousing awareness for rare pulmonary diseases such as PCD or CF.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY + INFORMATICS	1.1.

26341913	A longitudinal study of lung bacterial pathogens in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia	In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), impaired mucociliary clearance leads to an accumulation of secretions in the airways and susceptibility to repeated bacterial infections. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial flora in non-chronic and chronic infections in the lower airways of patients with PCD. We retrospectively reviewed the presence of bacteria from patients with PCD during an 11-year period and genotyped 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from 12 patients with chronic infection using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We identified 5450 evaluable cultures from 107 patients with PCD (median age 17 years, range 0-74 years) (median age at diagnosis 7.8 years, range 0-63 years). Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent microorganism. Other common pathogens were P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The number of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa at least once varied from 11 to 44 patients (15-47%) annually, and 42 patients (39%) met the criteria for chronic infection at least once. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated in teenagers and adults than children (p 0.02) and the prevalence was significantly lower in patients with preschool (<6 years) PCD diagnosis (p 0.04). Ten out of 12 patients (83%) were chronically infected with a unique clone-type of P. aeruginosa. No sharing of clone-types or patient-to-patient transmission was observed. In conclusion, PCD patients were infected by a unique set of bacteria acquired in an age-dependent sequence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently colonizes the lower respiratory tract and the incidence of chronic infection was higher than previously reported.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

26373788	Ciliary function and motor protein composition of human fallopian tubes	What is the motor protein composition and function of human fallopian tube (FT) cilia? Although the motor protein composition and function of human FT cilia resemble that of respiratory cilia, females with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are not necessarily infertile. FTs are lined with multiple motile cilia, which show a 9 + 2 ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. Case reports suggest an increased incidence of subfertility and ectopic pregnancy in women with PCD, a disease characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. This study consisted of an observational laboratory study on human FT specimens from five healthy females recruited from April 2012 to December 2013 and a descriptive observational retrospective analysis of a clinical PCD database. Human FT tissue was obtained from five healthy females after tubal ligation during caesarean delivery. Motor protein composition was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against dynein arms and nexin-dynein regulatory complex subunits. Ciliary motility was analysed by high-speed video microscopy. A retrospective search of our database of PCD individuals was performed for information on conception and childbirth. The motor protein composition of human FT cilia was identical to that of respiratory cilia. FT cilia showed coordinated beating, resulting in a directed fluid flow towards the uterine cavity. We identified nine PCD individuals with severe dysfunction of respiratory cilia who gave birth to children after spontaneous conception. This suggests that ciliary beating is not the key motor of ovum transport. FT cilia of affected PCD females were not available for analysis. Thus, it remains to be proven that FT cilia indeed show the same defects as respiratory cilia in PCD individuals. Comprehensive epidemiological studies are needed to determine the extent of female (sub-) fertility in PCD. Knowledge of the exact protein composition and function of FT cilia will contribute to a better understanding of cilia-generated fluid flow in female reproduction. These findings are important for subsequent studies of function and protein composition of FT cilia in PCD patients.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	2.4.

Congenital disorders of ciliary beating, referred to as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), are characterized by deficient mucociliary clearance and severe, recurrent respiratory infections. Numerous genetic defects, most of which can be detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are so far known to cause different abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. However, some defects are not regularly discernable by TEM because the ciliary architecture of the axoneme remains preserved. This applies in particular to isolated defects of the nexin links, also known as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), connecting the peripheral outer microtubular doublets. Immunofluorescence analyses of respiratory cells from PCD-affected individuals detected a N-DRC defect. Genome-wide exome sequence analyses identified recessive loss-of-function mutations in GAS8 encoding DRC4 in three independent PCD-affected families.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5.

26567984	Noninvasive Imaging Reveals Stable Transgene Expression in Mouse Airways After Delivery of a Nonintegrating Recombinant Adeno-Associated Viral Vector	Gene therapy holds promise to cure a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. Recent successes in recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-based gene therapy in the clinic for hereditary disorders such as Leber's congenital amaurosis and hemophilia B encouraged us to reexplore an rAAV approach for pulmonary gene transfer. Only limited clinical successes have been achieved for airway gene transfer so far, underscoring the need for further preclinical development of rAAV-based gene therapy for pulmonary disorders. We sought to determine the preclinical potential of an airway-tropic serotype, rAAV2/5, encoding reporter genes when delivered to mouse airways. Although several groups have assessed the stability of gene transfer using a nonintegrating rAAV in mouse airways, long-term stability for more than a year has not been reported. Additionally, an extensive quantitative analysis of the specific cell types targeted by rAAV2/5 using cell-specific markers is lacking. We obtained sustained gene expression in upper and lower airways up to 15 months after vector administration, a substantial proportion of the lifespan of a laboratory mouse. In addition, we demonstrated that readministration of rAAV2/5 to the airways is feasible and increases gene expression 14 months after primary vector administration, despite the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies. Finally, identification of transduced cell types revealed different subpopulations being targeted by rAAV2/5, with 64% of β-galactosidase-positive cells being ciliated cells, 34% club cells in the conducting airways, and 75% alveolar type II cells in the alveoli at 1 month postinjection. This underscores the therapeutic potential of a nonintegrating rAAV vector to develop a gene therapeutic drug for a variety of pulmonary disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and surfactant deficiencies.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.3.

26824761	ZMYND10--Mutation Analysis in Slavic Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare recessive disease with a prevalence of 1/10,000; its symptoms are caused by a kinetic dysfunction of motile cilia in the respiratory epithelium, flagella in spermatozoids, and primary cilia in the embryonic node. PCD is genetically heterogeneous: genotyping the already known PCD-related genes explains the genetic basis in 60-65% of the cases, depending on the population. While identification of new genes involved in PCD pathogenesis remains crucial, the search for new, population-specific mutations causative for PCD is equally important. The Slavs remain far less characterized in this respect compared to West European populations, which significantly limits diagnostic capability. The main goal of this study was to characterize the profile of causative genetic defects in one of the PCD-causing genes, ZMYND10, in the cohort of PCD patients of Slavic origin. The study was carried out using biological material from 172 unrelated PCD individuals of Polish origin, with no causative mutation found in nine major PCD genes. While none of the previously described mutations was found using the HRM-based screening, a novel frameshift mutation (c.367delC) in ZMYND10, unique for Slavic PCD population, was found in homozygous state in two unrelated PCD patients. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms from the ciliary axoneme, consistent with the already published ZMYND10-mutated phenotype; cDNA analysis revealed the lack of ZMYND10 mRNA, indicating nonsense-mediated decay of the truncated transcript.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

This study aims to develop a practical clinical diagnostic tool to identify patients requiring testing.Patients consecutively referred for testing were studied. Information readily obtained from patient history was correlated with diagnostic outcome. Using logistic regression, the predictive performance of the best model was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The model was simplified into a practical tool (PICADAR) and externally validated in a second diagnostic centre.Of 641 referrals with a definitive diagnostic outcome, 75 (12%) were positive. PICADAR applies to patients with persistent wet cough and has seven predictive parameters: full-term gestation, neonatal chest symptoms, neonatal intensive care admittance, chronic rhinitis, ear symptoms, situs inversus and congenital cardiac defect. Sensitivity and specificity of the tool were 0.90 and 0.75 for a cut-off score of 5 points. Area under the curve for the internally and externally validated tool was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively.PICADAR represents a simple diagnostic clinical prediction rule with good accuracy and validity, ready for testing in respiratory centres referring to PCD centres.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5.

26918822	DNAH6 and Its Interactions with PCD Genes in Heterotaxy and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving left-right patterning defects, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a sinopulmonary disease with dyskinetic/immotile cilia in the airway are seemingly disparate diseases. However, they have an overlapping genetic etiology involving mutations in cilia genes, a reflection of the common requirement for motile cilia in left-right patterning and airway clearance. While PCD is a monogenic recessive disorder, heterotaxy has a more complex, largely non-monogenic etiology. In this study, we show mutations in the novel dynein gene DNAH6 can cause heterotaxy and ciliary dysfunction similar to PCD. We provide the first evidence that trans-heterozygous interactions between DNAH6 and other PCD genes potentially can cause heterotaxy. DNAH6 was initially identified as a candidate heterotaxy/PCD gene by filtering exome-sequencing data from 25 heterotaxy patients stratified by whether they have airway motile cilia defects. dnah6 morpholino knockdown in zebrafish disrupted motile cilia in Kupffer's vesicle required for left-right patterning and caused heterotaxy with abnormal cardiac/gut looping. Similarly DNAH6 shRNA knockdown disrupted motile cilia in human and mouse respiratory epithelia. Notably a heterotaxy patient harboring heterozygous DNAH6 mutation was identified to also carry a rare heterozygous PCD-causing DNAI1 mutation, suggesting a DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interaction. Furthermore, sequencing of 149 additional heterotaxy patients showed 5 of 6 patients with heterozygous DNAH6 mutations also had heterozygous mutations in DNAH5 or other PCD genes. We functionally assayed for DNAH6/DNAH5 and DNAH6/DNAI1 trans-heterozygous interactions using subthreshold double-morpholino knockdown in zebrafish and showed this caused heterotaxy. Similarly, subthreshold siRNA knockdown of Dnah6 in heterozygous Dnah5 or Dnai1 mutant mouse respiratory epithelia disrupted motile cilia function. Together, these findings support an oligogenic disease model with broad relevance for further interrogating the genetic etiology of human ciliopathies.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

26976528	Pitfalls and Challenges of Lung Transplant in a Patient With Kartagener Syndrome and Scoliosis	We present a 22-year-old woman with Kartagener syndrome and scoliosis who died 112 days after single lung transplant. The classic thoracic involvement of situs inversus totalis and the asymmetric arrangement of the thoracic vascular structures might be a pitfall for surgeon. Anatomic obstacles have forced the surgeon to perform a single transplant. The period of primary graft dysfunction in a single transplanted lung patient was a challenge; supporting the patient with a high flow and long period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might lead to a vanishing bronchus. Immotile cilia, a feature of Kartagener syndrome, were another challenge and patient needed several daily aspiration bronchoscopies. Vanishing bronchus is a gradual process with high mortality rates; commonly, stenosis is at the non anastomotic bronchial tree because of insufficient nourishment of the bronchial cartilages. Several repeat bronchoscopic balloon dilatations accompanied with medical treatment were unsuccessful.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

27070726	Clinical Features and Associated Likelihood of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia in Children and Adolescents	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous, recessive disorder of motile cilia, is associated with distinct clinical features. Diagnostic tests, including ultrastructural analysis of cilia, nasal nitric oxide measurements, and molecular testing for mutations in PCD genes, have inherent limitations. To define a statistically valid combination of systematically defined clinical features that strongly associates with PCD in children and adolescents. Investigators at seven North American sites in the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium prospectively and systematically assessed individuals (aged 0-18 yr) referred due to high suspicion for PCD. The investigators defined specific clinical questions for the clinical report form based on expert opinion. Diagnostic testing was performed using standardized protocols and included nasal nitric oxide measurement, ciliary biopsy for ultrastructural analysis of cilia, and molecular genetic testing for PCD-associated genes. Final diagnoses were assigned as ""definite PCD"" (hallmark ultrastructural defects and/or two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), ""probable/possible PCD"" (no ultrastructural defect or genetic diagnosis, but compatible clinical features and nasal nitric oxide level in PCD range), and ""other diagnosis or undefined."" Criteria were developed to define early childhood clinical features on the basis of responses to multiple specific queries. Each defined feature was tested by logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to define the most robust set of clinical features associated with PCD. From 534 participants 18 years of age and younger, 205 were identified as having ""definite PCD"" (including 164 with two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), 187 were categorized as ""other diagnosis or undefined,"" and 142 were defined as having ""probable/possible PCD."" Participants with ""definite PCD"" were compared with the ""other diagnosis or undefined"" group. Four criteria-defined clinical features were statistically predictive of PCD: laterality defect; unexplained neonatal respiratory distress; early-onset, year-round nasal congestion; and early-onset, year-round wet cough (adjusted odds ratios of 7.7, 6.6, 3.4, and 3.1, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity based on the number of criteria-defined clinical features were four features, 0.21 and 0.99, respectively; three features, 0.50 and 0.96, respectively; and two features, 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.

27081490	Primary ciliary dyskinesia with complex abnormalities including cleavage of B-subfibers	A 25-year-old Japanese woman suffered from repeated respiratory tract infections. Because of her characteristic medical history and imaging findings, we suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and performed a transbronchial biopsy. The biopsy revealed complex abnormalities of the ciliary structure including cleavage of the B-subfibers observed by transmission electron microscopy analysis and the complete loss of ciliary motion by video analysis. Genetic examinations to diagnose PCD have progressed in recent years. However, in this case, the well-known genetic mutations in causal genes of PCD were not detected via whole-exome sequencing of the blood. Cleavage of the B-subfibers in patients with PCD has never been reported. This case appears to be the first report of this PCD subtype in humans.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

27288033	A longitudinal study characterising a large adult primary ciliary dyskinesia population	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in adults has not been well described. In this retrospective observational study we aimed to characterise a large adult population and identify features associated with disease progression.We retrospectively analysed 151 adult patients at a single tertiary centre at baseline and longitudinally for a median of 7 years.We found significant variation in age at diagnosis (median 23.5 years; range <1-72 years). Older age at diagnosis was associated with impaired baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (r= -0.30, p=0.01) and increased Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation (difference in medians 17 years (95% CI 4.5-20 years); p=0.002). Lung function decline was estimated at FEV1 decline of 0.49% predicted per year. Lung function decline was associated with ciliary ultrastructure, with microtubular defect patients having the greatest decline (p=0.04). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores of severity of bronchial wall dilatation (p<0.001) and extent of bronchiectasis (p=0.03) additionally showed evidence of modifying FEV1 decline with age.Our study reveals that a large proportion of adult PCD patients are diagnosed late, with impaired FEV1 and increased P. aeruginosa colonisation. Increased disease burden on HRCT and ciliary ultrastructure may predict progressive lung function decline. This study characterises a large adult PCD population, identifies features associated with disease progression and highlights the need for prospective trials to determine whether early diagnosis of high-risk subgroups alongside optimal management can modify disease progression.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

27366497	Anaesthetic Management of a Patient with Synchronous Kartagener Syndrome and Biliary Atresia	Kartagener syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by primary ciliary dyskinesia accompanied by sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. Synchronous extrahepatic biliary atresia and Kartagener syndrome are very rare. During the preoperative preparation of patients with Kartagener syndrome, special attention is required for the respiratory and cardiovascular system. It is important to provide suitable anaesthetic management to avoid problems because of ciliary dysfunction in the perioperative period. Further, maintaining an effective pain control with regional anaesthetic methods reduces the risk of pulmonary complications. Infants with biliary atresia operated earlier have a higher chance of survival. Hepatic dysfunction and decrease in plasma proteins are important for the kinetics of drugs.

Bicentric retrospective study, focusing on adults (≥18 years) with an asserted diagnosis of PCD based on the presence of bronchiectasis with typical ultrastructural defect of cilia and/or situs inversus (SI). Clinical symptoms, respiratory function, extent of bronchiectasis, microbiology and molecular analysis were assessed. Results are expressed as median (25th; 75th centile). 78 patients were included with a median follow-up of 8.1 years. 91% of patients had respiratory symptoms and 95% had chronic rhinosinusitis. Half of ultrastructural defects concerned dynein arms. Respiratory function was significantly lower in women (FEV1=60% predicted (50; 76), vs 77% (62; 95), p=0.009) and in patients with chronic airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA, n=21) infection (FEV1=60% (48; 71) vs 75% (55; 89), p=0.04).

27435107	Contribution of mucus concentration and secreted mucins Muc5ac and Muc5b to the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive lung disease	Airway diseases, including cigarette smoke-induced chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and primary ciliary dyskinesia are associated with decreased mucociliary clearance (MCC). However, it is not known whether a simple reduction in MCC or concentration-dependent mucus adhesion to airway surfaces dominates disease pathogenesis or whether decreasing the concentration of secreted mucins may be therapeutic. To address these questions, Scnn1b-Tg mice, which exhibit airway mucus dehydration/adhesion, were compared and crossed with Muc5b- and Muc5ac-deficient mice. Absence of Muc5b caused a 90% reduction in MCC, whereas Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited an ∼50% reduction. However, the degree of MCC reduction did not correlate with bronchitic airway pathology, which was observed only in Scnn1b-Tg mice. Ablation of Muc5b significantly reduced the extent of mucus plugging in Scnn1b-Tg mice. However, complete absence of Muc5b in Scnn1b-Tg mice was associated with increased airway inflammation, suggesting that Muc5b is required to maintain immune homeostasis. Loss of Muc5ac had few phenotypic consequences in Scnn1b-Tg mice. These data suggest that: (i) mucus hyperconcentration dominates over MCC reduction alone to produce bronchitic airway pathology; (ii) Muc5b is the dominant contributor to the Scnn1b-Tg phenotype; and (iii) therapies that limit mucin secretion may reduce plugging, but complete Muc5b removal from airway surfaces may be detrimental.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

27450411	Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections, through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

27464304	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: First Health-related Quality-of-Life Measures for Pediatric Patients	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease. There are no available data on disease-specific pediatric patient-reported outcomes. Our objective was to create developmentally appropriate, health-related quality-of-life questionnaires (QOL-PCD) for children (6-12 yr) and adolescents (13-17 yr) with PCD and a parent proxy measure. The QOL-PCD was developed using a cross-cultural protocol-driven approach satisfying both North American and European drug regulatory agency guidelines. A conceptual framework was generated by literature review, focus groups (expert clinicians and patients/parents), and open-ended interviews with children, adolescents, and parents of patients with PCD. We recruited participants from international research consortiums, PCD clinics, and patient advocacy groups, aiming for representation of a wide spectrum of disease severity, sociodemographic status, and ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained and experienced research assistants and psychologists. Transcripts were content-analyzed with Atlas.ti/NVivo to assess saturation of content. A self-completed item relevance survey was administered to E.U. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to construct draft instruments. Questionnaires were further refined after cognitive interviews. Focus groups (n = 62 experts; n = 20 patients/parents) and open-ended interviews with patients/parents (n = 69; 34 males; age at diagnosis, 0-15 yr; FEV1, 58-118% predicted) revealed a wide spectrum of issues unique to this population. Content analysis of transcripts identified the following domains, depending on age: Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Treatment Burden, Ears and Hearing, Sinus Symptoms, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, School Functioning, and Eating and Weight. Various items were retained in questionnaires, based on age and role of respondent: 37, 43, and 41 items for children, adolescents, and parent proxy, respectively. The item relevance survey (n = 57) yielded results similar to those of open-ended interviews. Cognitive testing (n = 47; 20 males; age at diagnosis, 0-11 yr; FEV1, 49-124% predicted) confirmed that items and response choices were clear and understood by respondents, and that all relevant items were included. The QOL-PCD measures, developed using rigorous, protocol-driven methods and international collaborations, have demonstrated content validity and cross-cultural equivalence for implementation in English-speaking populations.

A conceptual framework was generated by literature review, focus groups (expert clinicians and patients/parents), and open-ended interviews with children, adolescents, and parents of patients with PCD. We recruited participants from international research consortiums, PCD clinics, and patient advocacy groups, aiming for representation of a wide spectrum of disease severity, sociodemographic status, and ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted by trained and experienced research assistants and psychologists. Transcripts were content-analyzed with Atlas.ti/NVivo to assess saturation of content. A self-completed item relevance survey was administered to E.U. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to construct draft instruments. Questionnaires were further refined after cognitive interviews. Focus groups (n = 62 experts; n = 20 patients/parents) and open-ended interviews with patients/parents (n = 69; 34 males; age at diagnosis, 0-15 yr; FEV1, 58-118% predicted) revealed a wide spectrum of issues unique to this population. Content analysis of transcripts identified the following domains, depending on age: Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Treatment Burden, Ears and Hearing, Sinus Symptoms, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, School Functioning, and Eating and Weight. Various items were retained in questionnaires, based on age and role of respondent: 37, 43, and 41 items for children, adolescents, and parent proxy, respectively. The item relevance survey (n = 57) yielded results similar to those of open-ended interviews. Cognitive testing (n = 47; 20 males; age at diagnosis, 0-11 yr; FEV1, 49-124% predicted) confirmed that items and response choices were clear and understood by respondents, and that all relevant items were included. The QOL-PCD measures, developed using rigorous, protocol-driven methods and international collaborations, have demonstrated content validity and cross-cultural equivalence for implementation in English-speaking populations. Psychometric testing is underway to determine their measurement properties for evaluating clinical interventions and informing quality of care.

27618201	Aminoglycoside-stimulated readthrough of premature termination codons in selected genes involved in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Translational readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) induced by pharmacological compounds has proven to be an effective way of restoring functional protein expression and reducing symptoms in several genetic disorders. We tested the potential of different concentrations of several aminoglycosides (AAGs) for promoting PTC-readthrough in 5 genes involved in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder caused by the dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. The efficiency of readthrough stimulation of PTCs cloned in dual reporter vectors was examined in 2 experimental settings: in vitro (transcription/translation system) and ex vivo (transiently transfected epithelial cell line). PTC-readthrough was observed in 5 of the 16 mutations analyzed. UGA codons were more susceptible to AAG-stimulated readthrough than UAG; no suppression of UAA was observed. The efficiency of PTC-readthrough in vitro (from less than 1% to ∼28% of the translation from the corresponding wild-type constructs) differed with the AAG type and concentration, and depended on the combination of AAG and PTC, indicating that each PTC has to be individually tested with a range of stimulating compounds. The maximal values of PTC suppression observed in the ex vivo experiments were, depending on AAG used, 3-5 times lower than the corresponding values in vitro, despite using AAG concentrations that were 2 orders of magnitude higher. This indicates that, while the in vitro system is sufficient to examine the readthrough-susceptibility of PTCs, it is not sufficient to test the compounds potential to stimulate PTC-readthrough in the living cells. Most of the tested compounds (except for G418) at their highest concentrations did not disturb ciliogenesis in the cultures of primary respiratory epithelial cells from healthy donors.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.2.

27687975	Novel roles for the radial spoke head protein 9 in neural and neurosensory cilia	Cilia are cell surface organelles with key roles in a range of cellular processes, including generation of fluid flow by motile cilia. The axonemes of motile cilia and immotile kinocilia contain 9 peripheral microtubule doublets, a central microtubule pair, and 9 connecting radial spokes. Aberrant radial spoke components RSPH1, 3, 4a and 9 have been linked with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by ciliary dysmotility; yet, radial spoke functions remain unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Rsph9 is expressed in cells bearing motile cilia and kinocilia, and localizes to both 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. Using CRISPR mutagenesis, we show that rsph9 is required for motility of presumptive 9 + 2 olfactory cilia and, unexpectedly, 9 + 0 neural cilia. rsph9 is also required for the structural integrity of 9 + 2 and 9 + 0 ciliary axonemes. rsph9 mutant larvae exhibit reduced initiation of the acoustic startle response consistent with hearing impairment, suggesting a novel role for Rsph9 in the kinocilia of the inner ear and/or lateral line neuromasts. These data identify novel roles for Rsph9 in 9 + 0 motile cilia and in sensory kinocilia, and establish a useful zebrafish PCD model.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

A national multicenter study from 2012 to 2013 recruited patients diagnosed or suspected of having PCD. Diagnosis was verified using: nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO); High-speed Video Microscope Analysis (HVMA); Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of cilia; Immuno-fluorescence staining (IF) for ciliary proteins, and genetic analysis. Of the 203 patients recruited from 14 pediatric centers, 150 had a PCD diagnosis verified. Median age was 15.05y, with range 0.15-60.5y. PCD prevalence was 1:54,000 for the general population and 1:25,000 in children (5-14 y). For the non-Jewish (mainly Druze and Arab Moslem) compared to Jewish populations, prevalence was 1:16,500 and 1:139,000 respectively (p < 0.0001) and parental consanguinity was 85.4% and 21.9% respectively (p < 0.0001). Clinical features included bronchiectasis (88%), rhinitis (81%), recurrent pneumonia (78%), recurrent otitis (62%), neonatal pneumonia (60%) and situs inversus (42%). Prior diagnostic practices varied widely between centers with TEM assessed in 55% and abnormal in 61% of these. Management included antibiotics and airway clearance. Diagnostic verification revealed for 150 PCD patients: 81% nNO<233 ppb, 62% abnormal HVMA, 51% diagnostic TEM, 58% diagnostic IF and, 57% genetic diagnosis. PCD in Israel is rare, with comprehensive diagnostic tests showing prevalence in children similar to Europe. Prevalence was higher in non-Jews, associated with parental consanguinity.

27779714	Whole-exome sequencing identification of novel DNAH5 mutations in a young patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by structural and/or functional impairment of cilia throughout the whole body. Early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long‑term sequelae, however early diagnosis is a challenge due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD. In the current study, the patient with PCD was diagnosed at nine years old following several efforts to control intractable airway symptoms. The patient experienced a chronic productive cough beginning in early childhood and had multiple episodes of pneumonia and otitis media with effusion and sinusitis. No situs inversus or other heterotaxias were reported. Serial chest X‑rays exhibited persistent atelectasis and bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe. When the patient was nine years old, electron microscopy of his cilia and genetic analysis were conducted. Electron microscopy of a biopsy specimen from the nasal mucosa indicated loss of the outer dynein arms. Whole‑exome analysis of the genome demonstrated the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5: NM_001369.2:c.5983C>T, p.Arg1995X in exon 36 and NM_001369.2:c.9101delG, p.Gly3034ValfsX22 in exon 54; neither of which have been previously reported in the literature in a Japanese patient. Notably, this case is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of PCD caused by the DNAH5 mutation in a Japanese patient.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

The BRR is a database of patients with non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) enrolled at 13 sites in the United States. Baseline demographic, spirometric, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data were entered into a central Internet-based database. Patients were subsequently analyzed by the presence of NTM. We enrolled 1,826 patients between 2008 and 2014. Patients were predominantly women (79%), white (89%), and never smokers (60%), with a mean age of 64 ± 14 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients had a history of NTM disease or NTM isolated at baseline evaluation for entry into the BRR. Patients with NTM were older, predominantly women, and had bronchiectasis diagnosed at a later age than those without NTM. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was more common in those with NTM, whereas asthma, primary immunodeficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia were more common in those without NTM. Fifty-one percent of patients had spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction. Patients with NTM were more likely to have diffusely dilated airways and tree-in-bud abnormalities. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were cultured less commonly in patients with NTM. Bronchial hygiene measures were used more often in those with NTM, whereas antibiotics used for exacerbations, rotating oral antibiotics, steroid use, and inhaled bronchodilators were more commonly used in those without NTM. Adult patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the US BRR are described, with differences noted in demographic, radiographic, microbiological, and treatment variables based on stratification of the presence of NTM.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

The aim was to determine the changes in etiology of bronchiectasis. Patients who admitted to Behçet Uz Children Hospital between 2005 and 2015 (n=110) were retrospectively examined. The etiology of bronchiectasis was detected as; primary ciliary dyskinesia 26.4%, protracted bacterial bronchitis 22.8%, primary immune deficiency 11.8%, bronchiolitis obliterans 8.2%, lung disease secondary to gastro-esophageal reflux 3.7%, foreign body aspiration 2.7%, tuberculosis %2.7, congenital malformation 1.8% and asthma 1.8%, respectively. In 15.4% of cases, etiology was not identified clearly. 91% of the patients were medically treated. In ten years, the frequency of asthma and tuberculosis in etiology had decreased but primary ciliary dyskinesia and primary immune deficiency had increased. Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis can be followed up for a long time with medical treatment.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

27979861	BMI-1 extends proliferative potential of human bronchial epithelial cells while retaining their mucociliary differentiation capacity.	Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of primary airway epithelial cells enables mucociliary differentiation providing an in vitro model of the human airway, but their proliferative potential is limited. To extend proliferation, these cells were previously transduced with viral oncogenes or mouse Bmi-1 + hTERT, but the resultant cell lines did not undergo mucociliary differentiation. We hypothesized that use of human BMI-1 alone would increase the proliferative potential of bronchial epithelial cells while retaining their mucociliary differentiation potential. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells were transduced by lentivirus with BMI-1 and then their morphology, replication kinetics, and karyotype were assessed. When differentiated at ALI, mucin production, ciliary function, and transepithelial electrophysiology were measured. Finally, shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells was used to model primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). BMI-1-transduced basal cells showed normal cell morphology, karyotype, and doubling times despite extensive passaging. The cell lines underwent mucociliary differentiation when cultured at ALI with abundant ciliation and production of the gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B evident. Cilia displayed a normal beat frequency and 9+2 ultrastructure. Electrophysiological characteristics of BMI-1-transduced cells were similar to those of untransduced cells. shRNA knockdown of DNAH5 in BMI-1 cells produced immotile cilia and absence of DNAH5 in the ciliary axoneme as seen in cells from patients with PCD. BMI-1 delayed senescence in bronchial epithelial cells, increasing their proliferative potential but maintaining mucociliary differentiation at ALI. We have shown these cells are amenable to genetic manipulation and can be used to produce novel disease models for research and dissemination.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	2.3.

In this study, through two cases of KS, we aimed to assess the clinical and genetic characteristics of KS caused by DNAH5 mutations. The two cases of KS from the same family underwent extensive clinical assessments, with next-generation DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify pathogenic genes. In addition, Sanger sequencing was used to verify the pedigrees. The present study employed a directional capture strategy for hereditary disease screening, which correctly identified the virulence sites in the pedigree, and facilitated the differential diagnosis among multiple genes. Two novel mutations were detected in DNAH5: c.7778C>T (missense mutation) and c.13729G>A (nonsense mutation). They were not found in dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, and ExAC. These findings demonstrated that new DNAH5 mutations could be used for molecular diagnosis of KS, providing families with genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28029746	Respiratory manifestations in 38 patients with Alström syndrome	Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare, multi-system condition characterized by retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, obesity, insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, cardiomyopathy, hepatorenal disease, and recurrent respiratory infections. It belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as primary ciliopathies, which includes autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney diseases, as well as Joubert and Bardet-Biedl syndromes. Prior studies have suggested phenotypic overlap between primary ciliopathies affecting the non-motile, sensory cilia, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a motile ciliopathy characterized by respiratory tract disease. We describe the burden of oto-sino-pulmonary disease in 38 individuals with AS and examines the degree of clinical overlap between PCD and AS. Evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center included clinical examination, chest imaging, and clinical history surveys, as well as measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in nine patients. Recurrent otitis media was ubiquitous in the AS cohort (92%) with 50% requiring pressure equalization tube placement. A history of bronchitis/pneumonia and sinusitis was reported in 61% and 50% of individuals, respectively. PCD-characterizing symptoms (laterality defects, unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion, and wet cough) were far less prevalent in the AS cohort compared to PCD, and the average nNO production in the AS cohort was 232 ± 57.1 nl/min compared to a cut-off of <77 nl/min for PCD. These data suggest that the oto-sino-respiratory complications in AS are prominent enough to warrant increased clinical attention, but significantly impaired respiratory cilia function as seen in PCD is unlikely in AS.

Seventy-two adults (mean (range) age: 33 years (18-79 years); mean (range) FEV1% predicted: 68 (26-115)) with PCD completed the 49-item QOL-PCD and generic QOL measures: Short-Form 36 Health Survey, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20) and St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)-C. Thirty-five participants repeated QOL-PCD 10-14 days later to measure stability or reproducibility of the measure. Multitrait analysis was used to evaluate how the items loaded on 10 hypothesised scales: physical, emotional, role and social functioning, treatment burden, vitality, health perceptions, upper respiratory symptoms, lower respiratory symptoms and ears and hearing symptoms. This analysis of item-to-total correlations led to 9 items being dropped; the validated measure now comprises 40 items. Each scale had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.74 to 0.94). Two-week test-retest demonstrated stability for all scales (intraclass coefficients 0.73 to 0.96). Significant correlations were obtained between QOL-PCD scores and age and FEV1. Strong relationships were also found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, lower respiratory symptoms and SGRQ-C (r=0.72, p<0.001), while weak correlations were found between measures of different constructs. QOL-PCD has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity. QOL-PCD offers a promising tool for evaluating new therapies and for measuring symptoms, functioning and QOL during routine care.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.2.

28284321	Matrix metalloproteinases and airway remodeling and function in primary ciliary dyskinesia	The balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) is important in the regulation of airway damage. To evaluate whether they are important in the pathophysiology of primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, SCD). We measured sputum bacteriology, lung CT changes, MMPs, TIMPs and lung function in 86 patients (51 PCD, 35 SCD) in a cross-sectional study; the 10 controls studied did not have HRCT or sputum cultures. MMPs, TIMPs and lung function were evaluated longitudinally for up to one year in 38 PCD patients. At baseline, there were no differences in MMPs, TIMPs and MMPs/TIMPs, between PCD and SCD but lower levels were found in controls. There was an association between poorer lung function with increasing levels of MMPs in PCD, while in SCD only MMP-9/TIMP-1 values correlated with FRC z-scores. Levels of MMPs and TIMPs significantly correlated with severity HRCT changes. Longitudinally, there were significant correlations between slope of changes in spirometric parameters and slope of change in sputum MMPs in PCD patients. In conclusion, we report for the first time that increased MMPs are associated with worse airway damage in PCD and SCD, and thus are potential therapeutic targets.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28290230	Cilia and Ear	To investigate the prevalence of otological complications derived from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in adulthood. Twenty-three patients with diagnosed PCD underwent medical history aimed at recording the presence of ear, nose, and throat manifestations (ENT) and any surgical treatments. The ENT objectivity was annotated, and then patients were subjected to audiometric test, tympanometry, registration of otoacoustic emission, and vestibular evaluation. Otitis media with chronic middle ear effusion (OME) during childhood was reported in 52% of the subjects, no patient had undergone ear surgery, and only 2 patients had an episode of otitis in the last year. Eleven of 23 patients showed normal hearing, 11 had a conductive hearing impairment, and 1 showed a severe sensorineural hearing loss unrelated to the syndrome. The bilateral stapedial reflex was only found in all cases of normoacusia and type A tympanogram, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were present in 8 patients, and no patient had vestibular alterations. Our study confirms a very frequent prevalence of OME in PCD during childhood. Careful monitoring of otological complications of the syndrome is always desirable, also given the high presence in adults of other manifestations in the upper airways, such as chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28344781	Patient-specific three-dimensional explant spheroids derived from human nasal airway epithelium: a simple methodological approach for ex vivo studies of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Three-dimensional explant spheroid formation is an ex vivo technique previously used in studies of airway epithelial ion and water transport. Explanted cells and sheets of nasal epithelium form fully differentiated spheroids enclosing a partly fluid-filled lumen with the ciliated apical surface facing the outside and accessible for analysis of ciliary function. We performed a two-group comparison study of ciliary beat pattern and ciliary beat frequency in spheroids derived from nasal airway epithelium in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in healthy controls. Nasal ciliary cells and sheets were removed on day 1 by nasal brush biopsy and analyzed with regard to ciliary beat pattern-and frequency using high-speed video imaging for standard reference values. Three-dimensional explant spheroid formation was initiated in the same individual on the same day by incubation of cells and sheets from a separate brush biopsy. Harvested spheroids were analyzed earliest possible and values of spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were compared to the corresponding reference values from day 1. Spheroids formed fast in serum-free culture medium. Formation was successful in 15 out of 18 (82%) sampled individuals. Thus, formation was successful in seven healthy controls and eight PCD patients, while unsuccessful in 3 with PCD due to infection. Median (range) number of days in culture before harvesting of spheroids was 4 (1-5) in healthy versus 2 (1-5) in PCD. Spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were unchanged compared to their corresponding day 1 standard reference values. Spheroid ciliary beat frequency discriminated highly significant between healthy controls (9.3 Hz) and PCD patients (2.4 Hz) (P < 0.0001). Survival of spheroids was 16 days in a single healthy person. Patient-specific three-dimensional explant spheroid formation from a minimal invasive nasal brush biopsy is a feasible, fast and valid ex vivo method to assess ciliary function with potential of aiding the diagnosis of PCD. In addition, it may be a useful model in the investigation of pathophysiological aspects and drug effects in human nasal airway epithelium.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28403885	Lung structure and function similarities between primary ciliary dyskinesia and mild cystic fibrosis: a pilot study	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are increasingly compared. There are no chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comparative studies of PCD and CF. We assessed clinical, functional, microbiological and MRI findings in PCD and mild CF patients in order to evaluate different expression of lung disease. Twenty PCD (15.1 years) and 20 CF subjects with mild respiratory impairment (16 years, 70% with pancreatic insufficiency) underwent MRI, spirometry, and sputum cultures when clinically stable. MRI was scored using the modified Helbich system. PCD was diagnosed later than CF (9.9 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.03), despite earlier symptoms (0.1 versus 0.6 years, p = 0.02). In the year preceding the study, patients from both groups underwent two systemic antibiotic courses (p = 0.48). MRI total scores were 11.6 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 1 in PCD and CF, respectively. FEV1 and FVC Z-scores were -1.75 (range, -4.6-0.7) and -0.6 (-3.9-1.8) in PCD, and -0.9 (range, -5.4-2.3) and -0.3 (-3.4-2.5) in CF, respectively. No difference was found between lung function or structure, despite a higher MRI subscore of collapse/consolidation in PCD versus CF (1.6 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed after data-control for diagnostic delay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more frequent in CF than in PCD (p = 0.05 and p = 0.003, respectively). MRI is a valuable radiation-free tool for comparative PCD and CF lung disease assessment. Patients with PCD may exhibit similar MRI and lung function changes as CF subjects with mild pulmonary disease. Delay in PCD diagnosis is unlikely the only determinant of similarities.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

28501546	Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia: When and how?	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital disorder involving permanent ubiquitous structural and/or functional ciliary abnormalities. A single-center retrospective study included 56 cases of PCD (respiratory form) out of a cohort of 280 patients with suspected PCD. The main features of history-taking and clinical examination were analyzed, to formulate a pragmatic diagnostic procedure, easy to implement in clinical practice. Chronic respiratory tract infectious symptoms are sensitive but non-specific for the diagnosis of PCD. Nasal brushing for phase-contrast microscopy study of ciliary morphology and activity proved to be a fast, easy, non-invasive, cost-effective and age-independent diagnostic method. In doubtful cases, depending on local availability, further tests are indicated: nasal nitric oxide level, electronic microscopy, genetic study and cell culture. In suspected PCD, there being no gold standard method of screening and early diagnosis, nasal brushing with ciliary study is contributive, alongside numerous other complementary tests, on condition that the clinician is experienced and results are interpreted in the light of clinical examination and history-taking.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28579561	Normal values of offline exhaled and nasal nitric oxide in healthy children and teens using chemiluminescence	Nitric oxide (NO) can be used to detect respiratory or ciliary diseases. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement can reflect ongoing eosinophilic airway inflammation and has a diagnostic utility as a test for asthma screening and follow-up while nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is a valuable screening tool for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. The possibility of collecting airway gas samples in an offline manner offers the advantage to extend these measures and improve the screening and management of these diseases, but normal values from healthy children and teens remain sparse. Samples were consecutively collected using the offline method for eNO and nNO chemiluminescence measurement in 88 and 31 healthy children and teens, respectively. Offline eNO measurement was also performed in 30 consecutive children with naïve asthma and/or respiratory allergy. The normal offline eNO value was determined by the following regression equation -8.206 + 0.176 × height. The upper limit of the norm for the offline eNO value was 27.4 parts per billion (ppb). A separate analysis was performed in children, pre-teens and teens, for which offline eNO was 13.6 ± 4.7 ppb, 16.3 ± 13.7 ppb and 20.0 ± 7.2 ppb, respectively. The optimal cut-off value of the offline eNO to predict asthma or respiratory allergies was 23.3 ppb, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 91%, respectively. Mean offline nNO was determined at 660 ppb with the lower limit of the norm at 197 ppb. The use of offline eNO and nNO normal values should favour the widespread screening of respiratory diseases in children of school age in their usual environment.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

A 36-year-old nonsmoking Chinese man present to the emergency department of our hospital with acute-onset breathlessness and sudden-onset left-sided chest pain. The patient had 6 years primary infertility and suffered from recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections since childhood. Chest X-ray was performed, which showed a left-sided pneumothorax with lung collapse. His conditions improved in clinical symptoms after 3 days of closed thoracic drainage. Radiographic findings after lung recruitment revealed bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis but no situs inversus. Paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) showed maxillary sinusitis and ethmoid sinusitis. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated severe obstructive ventilation functional impairment. Bronchial mucosal cilia showed the absence of both outer and inner dynein arms of the microtubules (ODA and IDA). A culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. His clinical symptoms and CT images showed improvement after 1 month of treatment. A literature review revealed that few patients are diagnosed with PCD complicated with spontaneous pneumothorax. Within one year of follow-up, the patient showed good responses to local ICS+ LA beta2 agonist combined with oral carbocistein. Pneumothorax might be one of the complications of the PCD. Combination therapy including ICS+ LA beta2 agonist and carbocistein could be a potential therapy to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and delay progression of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

28801648	An effective combination of whole-exome sequencing and runs of homozygosity for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in consanguineous families	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is clinically characterized by neonatal respiratory distress, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and infertility, and situs inversus in 50% of the patients. PCD is a result of mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in ciliary function, and is primarily inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Diagnosis of PCD is often a challenging task due to its high clinical and genetic heterogeneities. In the present study, we attempted to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with runs of homozygosity (ROH) approaches to identify the genetic defects in four Chinese consanguineous families with clinical PCD. We successfully identified three recently acknowledged PCD genes: DYX1C1, CCNO and ARMC4, and one well-characterized PCD gene, DNAI1. Our study provides compelling evidence that WES in combination with ROH analysis is an efficient diagnostic tool for identifying genetic causes of PCD in consanguineous families. Furthermore, our work expands the genetic mutation spectrum in PCD, and provides the additional tools to better serve the counseling of the families with PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

28939216	A targeted next-generation sequencing panel reveals novel mutations in Japanese patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by functional impairment of cilia throughout the body. The early diagnosis of PCD is important for the prevention of long-term sequelae; however, this is often challenging because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PCD and difficulty in genetic analysis. The majority of PCD patients in Japan are not diagnosed properly. To diagnose PCD more accurately, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. We examined 46 patients (age range, 1-64 years; 23 male and 23 female) who were clinically suspected of PCD. First, mutation hotspots in DNAH5 and DNAI1 were sequenced by the Sanger method. Next, exome sequencing was performed in 32 known PCD genes using our novel NGS panel with the Ion Torrent PGM system. Variant annotation was generated by Ion Reporter Version 5.0 (Life Technologies). Mutations found in the panel were validated by Sanger sequencing. Disease-causing gene mutations were found in 10 patients from 7 families: DNAH5 in 4 families, and DNAI1, CCDC40, and RSPH4A in 1 family each. Heterozygous mutations were found in 1 patient. The majority of the mutations found in the present analysis were novel. Japanese PCD patients have novel mutations in cilia-related genes. This targeted NGS panel can identify disease-causing mutations in patients with PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

29018009	Paediatric case of ductal origin of right pulmonary artery presenting with exertional dyspnoea and mimicking asthma and primary ciliary dyskinesia	Ductal origin of pulmonary artery is a rare anomaly that is frequently misdiagnosed. Patients may present with exertional dyspnoea, recurrent respiratory infections and pulmonary hypertension. The presence of pulmonary hypertension can adversely affect clinical outcome in these patients; hence, early identification and intervention is the key to improve survival. A case of a 3-year-old child presenting with exertional dyspnoea is presented in this report. Chest radiograph revealed right-sided pulmonary hypoplasia and mediastinal shift to the right. Pulmonary artery agenesis was suspected when CT of the chest demonstrated right-sided pulmonary artery agenesis. Cardiac catheterisation revealed the correct diagnosis of ductal origin of right pulmonary artery. The most striking feature of this case is that the clinical presentation is mild compared with the findings on imaging.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29056509	The effect of l-Arginine on Ciliary Beat Frequency in PCD patients, non-PCD respiratory patients and healthy controls	Few studies have examined the potentially therapeutic effect of increasing the production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. Nasal NO is low in PCD and has been found to correlate with compromised Ciliary Beat Frequency (CBF). In this study we assessed the effect of increasing l-Arginine, as the substrate of NO synthases, on CBF in biopsies of human respiratory ciliated epithelium. A total of 28 suspect cases with chronic respiratory manifestations referred for PCD diagnostic testing and 8 healthy controls underwent nasal brushing. Obtained epithelial cells were divided between three culture medium 199 solutions, containing different levels of l-Arginine (0.33 mM as baseline, 1 mM and 10 Mm as increased levels). CBF measurements were obtained at 37 °C and 25 °C at 1, 3 and 24 h after sample acquisition. Among a total of 36 recruited subjects, 8 had PCD confirmed (PCD n = 8), 20 had PCD excluded (non-PCD n = 20) and 8 were healthy controls (Healthy Controls = 8). Among PCD subjects, ciliary motility was characterized by rotational (n = 5) or dyskinetic (n = 3) beating. At 37 °C, compared to baseline, higher levels of l-Arginine resulted in up to 9% CBF increase at 1 h (p = 0.007), up to 9% CBF increase at 3 h (p < 0.001) and up to 12% CBF increase at 24 h (p = 0.002). Similar although smaller scale increases were recorded at 25 °C. The effect of l-Arginine was time dependent (interaction p = 0.002) and was similar in PCD patients, non-PCD chronic respiratory patients and healthy controls (interaction p = 0.800). l-Arginine increases CBF and merits to be evaluated as a potential stimulator of mucociliary clearance in chronic respiratory conditions and congenital ciliary disorders with residual motility. Larger human studies are needed to confirm these findings.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

29116124	Monocytes from patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia show enhanced inflammatory properties and produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines	Patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) suffer from recurrent upper and lower airway infections due to defects in the cilia present on the respiratory epithelium. Since chronic inflammatory conditions can cause changes in innate immune responses, we investigated whether monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of pediatric PCD patients respond differently to inflammatory stimuli, compared to monocytes from healthy children and adults. The receptor for C5a (C5aR) was upregulated in PCD, whereas expression levels of the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, BLT1 and FPR1 on PCD monocytes were similar to those on monocytes from healthy individuals. Also in vitro migration of PCD monocytes towards the ligands of those receptors (CCL2, fMLP, C5a and LTB4) was normal. Compared to healthy children, PCD patients had a higher percentage of the non-classic monocyte subset (CD14+CD16++) in circulation. Finally, PCD monocytes produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL18 and CCL22) in response to LPS, peptidoglycan and/or dsRNA stimulation. These data suggest that monocytes might exacerbate inflammatory reactions in PCD patients and might maintain a positive feedback-loop feeding the inflammatory process.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29121203	Functional characterization of tektin-1 in motile cilia and evidence for TEKT1 as a new candidate gene for motile ciliopathies	A child presenting with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS), characterized by renal, retinal and skeletal involvements, was also diagnosed with lung infections and airway ciliary dyskinesia. These manifestations suggested dysfunction of both primary and motile cilia, respectively. Targeted exome sequencing identified biallelic mutations in WDR19, encoding an IFT-A subunit previously associated with MZSDS-related chondrodysplasia, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia and cranioectodermal dysplasia, linked to primary cilia dysfunction, and in TEKT1 which encodes tektin-1 an uncharacterized member of the tektin family, mutations of which may cause ciliary dyskinesia. Tektin-1 localizes at the centrosome in cycling cells, at basal bodies of both primary and motile cilia and to the axoneme of motile cilia in airway cells. The identified mutations impaired these localizations. In addition, airway cells from the affected individual showed severe motility defects without major ultrastructural changes. Knockdown of tekt1 in zebrafish resulted in phenotypes consistent with a function for tektin-1 in ciliary motility, which was confirmed by live imaging. Finally, experiments in the zebrafish also revealed a synergistic effect of tekt1 and wdr19. Altogether, our data show genetic interactions between WDR19 and TEKT1 likely contributing to the overall clinical phenotype observed in the affected individual and provide strong evidence for TEKT1 as a new candidate gene for primary ciliary dyskinesia.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

Fifteen patients (mean age, 16.9 years [range, 1-32 yr]; 8 males and 7 females) diagnosed with PCD at our university hospital in the last 12 years. Diagnostic. Electron microscopy of nasal cilia, gene mutation analysis, endoscopy of 30 eardrums, pure-tone audiometry, and tympanometry. All 15 patients showed ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities on electron microscopy and/or biallelic mutations in genes associated with ciliary function or structure. All 30 eardrums examined showed certain abnormalities. Fourteen patients had otitis media with effusion or its sequelae. The remaining patient had chronic otitis media. Pure-tone audiometry revealed the mean air conduction thresholds to be 25.0 and 26.4 dB in the right and left ears, respectively. In the ears with better hearing and worse hearing, the mean air conduction thresholds were 22.3 and 29.0 dB respectively. Otologic disease among patients with PCD essentially comprised otitis media with effusion, and the patients' eardrums showed a variety of findings. Knowledge of these otologic features may lead to the early detection of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29167384	DRC2/CCDC65 is a central hub for assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex and other regulators of ciliary and flagellar motility	The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) plays a central role in the regulation of ciliary and flagellar motility. In most species, the N-DRC contains at least 11 subunits, but the specific function of each subunit is unknown. Mutations in three subunits (DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, DRC4/GAS8) have been linked to defects in ciliary motility in humans and lead to a ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Here we characterize the biochemical, structural, and motility phenotypes of two mutations in the DRC2 gene of Chlamydomonas Using high-resolution proteomic and structural approaches, we find that the C-terminal region of DRC2 is critical for the coassembly of DRC2 and DRC1 to form the base plate of N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubule. Loss of DRC2 in drc2 mutants disrupts the assembly of several other N-DRC subunits and also destabilizes the assembly of several closely associated structures such as the inner dynein arms, the radial spokes, and the calmodulin- and spoke-associated complex. Our study provides new insights into the range of ciliary defects that can lead to PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

We investigated height, body mass index (BMI), and lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).In this study, based on the international PCD (iPCD) Cohort, we calculated z-scores for height and BMI using World Health Organization (WHO) and national growth references, and assessed associations with age, sex, country, diagnostic certainty, age at diagnosis, organ laterality and lung function in multilevel regression models that accounted for repeated measurements.We analysed 6402 measurements from 1609 iPCD Cohort patients. Height was reduced compared to WHO (z-score -0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) and national references (z-score -0.27, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.21) in male and female patients in all age groups, with variation between countries. Height and BMI were higher in patients diagnosed earlier in life (p=0.026 and p<0.001, respectively) and closely associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity z-scores (p<0.001).Our study indicates that both growth and nutrition are affected adversely in PCD patients from early life and are both strongly associated with lung function. If supported by longitudinal studies, these findings suggest that early diagnosis with multidisciplinary management and nutritional advice could improve growth and delay disease progression and lung function impairment in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Medical charts were reviewed to identify factors that influence severity and progression of hearing loss. 56 patients met inclusion criteria and 42 patients had HL. 66.6% had bilateral and 33.3% had unilateral loss (70 total ears with HL). Conductive hearing loss (CHL) was the most common type of HL, though 30% of children had some sensorineural component to their hearing loss. 92.9% of children with HL received at least one diagnosis of otitis media, but HL did not improve in the majority (77.8%) of ears in our study regardless of ear tube placement. Slight to mild CHL and all types of otitis media are prevalent among patients with PCD, and some of these children have sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).

Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life.

29320622	Kartagener’s syndrome: A case report	Kartagener’s syndrome is a recessive autosomal disease which is mainly seen to affect ciliary movement. The symptoms of the syndrome are the consequence of the defective motility of the cilia found in the respiratory tract and that results with recurrent lung infections caused by mucus stasis in the bronchi. A 37-year-old married, male father of one child, presented with a history of productive cough, wheezing, dispnea, headache, temporary fever. In his 9th year of age, 1986, situs inversus, sinusitis and pectus excavatum were diagnosed. In 1994 he was operated for correction of pectus excavatum. Bronchial asthma was diagnosed in 2008 when he was 31. In the last 2 years he had episodes of breathlessness, wheezing, cough, expectoration, headache, fever and fast declining lung function. The patient was treated with combination of inhaled bronchodilatators (inhaled corticosteroids + long-acting β-2 agonist), and occasional administration of antibiotics, oral prednisolone, mucolytics in episodes of exacerbations of disease over a period of 7−14 days. Treatment for patients with this syndrome has not been established yet, but it is important to control chronic lung infections and prevent declining of lung function.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

29322037	Persistent Bacterial Bronchitis: Time to Venture beyond the Umbrella	Chronic cough in children is common and frequently mismanaged. In the past, cough was diagnosed as asthma and inappropriate asthma therapies prescribed and escalated. It has been realized that persistent bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of wet cough and responds to oral antibiotics. The initial definition comprised a history of chronic wet cough, positive bronchoalveolar (BAL) cultures for a respiratory pathogen and response to a 2-week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This is now termed PBB-micro; PBB-clinical eliminates the need for BAL. PBB-extended is PBB-micro or PBB-clinical but resolution necessitating 4 weeks of antibiotics; and recurrent PBB is >3 attacks of PBB-micro or-clinical/year. However, the airway has only a limited range of responses to chronic inflammation and infection, and neutrophilic airway disease is seen in many other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, both chronic suppurative lung disease endotypes, whose recognition has led to huge scientific and clinical advances. There is an urgent need to extend endotyping into PBB, especially PBB-recurrent. We need to move from associative studies and, in particular, deploy sophisticated modern -omics technologies and systems biology, rather as has been done in the context of asthma in U-BIOPRED. In summary, the use of the term PBB has done signal service in pointing us away from prescribing asthma therapies to children with infected airways, but we now need to move beyond a simple description to teasing out underlying endotypes.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3. THERAPEUTICS IN THE CLINIC		278	Persistent Bacterial Bronchitis: Time to Venture beyond the Umbrella. Chronic cough in children is common and frequently mismanaged.

29339787	Cilia-related protein SPEF2 regulates osteoblast differentiation	Sperm flagellar protein 2 (SPEF2) is essential for motile cilia, and lack of SPEF2 function causes male infertility and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Cilia are pointing out from the cell surface and are involved in signal transduction from extracellular matrix, fluid flow and motility. It has been shown that cilia and cilia-related genes play essential role in commitment and differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts during bone formation. Here we show that SPEF2 is expressed in bone and cartilage. The analysis of a Spef2 knockout (KO) mouse model revealed hydrocephalus, growth retardation and death prior to five weeks of age. To further elucidate the causes of growth retardation we analyzed the bone structure and possible effects of SPEF2 depletion on bone formation. In Spef2 KO mice, long bones (tibia and femur) were shorter compared to wild type, and X-ray analysis revealed reduced bone mineral content. Furthermore, we showed that the in vitro differentiation of osteoblasts isolated from Spef2 KO animals was compromised. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel function for SPEF2 in bone formation through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone growth.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

29362708	Upper airway involvement in bronchiectasis is marked by early onset and allergic features	The association of bronchiectasis with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been reported. However, apart from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), predisposing conditions have not been established. We aimed to define clinical and laboratory features that differentiate patients with bronchiectasis with upper airway symptoms (UASs) and without PCD from patients without UASs. We reviewed charts of adults with bronchiectasis, excluding CF and PCD. UASs were defined as nasal discharge most days of the year, sinusitis or nasal polyps. Laboratory data included IgG, total IgE, blood eosinophils, sputum bacteriology and lung function. A radiologist blinded to UAS presence scored bronchiectasis (Reiff score) and sino-nasal pathology (Lund-Mackay score). Of 197 patients, for the 70 (35%) with UASs, symptoms started earlier (34±25 versus 46±24 years; p=0.001), disease duration was longer (median 24 versus 12 years; p=0.027), exacerbations were more frequent (median 3 versus 2 per year; p=0.14), and peripheral blood eosinophil (median 230 versus 200 μL-1; p=0.015) and total IgE (median 100 versus 42 IU·mL-1; p=0.085) levels were higher. The sinus computed tomography score was independently associated with exacerbations, with 1 point on the Lund-Mackay score associated with a 1.03-fold increase in the number of exacerbations per year (95% CI 1.0-1.05; p=0.004). These findings may implicate a higher disease burden in patients with UASs. We hypothesise that UASs precede and may in some cases lead to the development of bronchiectasis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2. RELATED DISEASES	1.1.

29366817	Gas exchanges in children with cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia: A retrospective study	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) both entail bronchiectasis and pulmonary impairment as measured using spirometry, during childhood. We aimed at looking whether blood gas exchanges progressed differently between CF and PCD children in a retrospective study of repeated measurements. Comparisons between groups (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests) and a mixed linear model, adjusted for age, evaluated associations between diseases and PaO2, PaCO2, or PaO2-PaCO2 ratio. Among 42 PCD and 73 CF children, 62% and 59% had respectively bronchiectasis (P = 0.75). Spirometry and blood gases were similar at inclusion (PaO2 median [IQR] PCD -1.80 [-3.40; -0.40]; CF -1.80 [-4.20; 0.60] z-scores; P = 0.72). PaO2 and PaO2-PaCO2 ratio similarly and significantly decreased with age in both groups (P < 0.01) whereas PaCO2 increased more in CF (P = 0.02) remaining within the range of normal (except for one child). To conclude, gas exchange characteristics, similarly initially impaired in PCD and CF children, tended to less deteriorate with time in PCD children who could benefit from an early diagnosis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

29402277	Live birth after Laser Assisted Viability Assessment (LAVA) to detect pentoxifylline resistant ejaculated immotile spermatozoa during ICSI in a couple with male Kartagener's syndrome	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease with abnormalities in the structure of cilia, causing impairment of muco-ciliary clearance with respiratory tract infections, heterotaxia and abnormal sperm motility with male infertility. Here, with a comprehensive literature review, we report a couple with an infertility history of 9 years and three unsuccessful IVF treatments, where male partner has Kartagener's Syndrome, a subtype of PCD, displaying recurrent respiratory infections, dextrocardia and total asthenozoospermia. His diagnosis was verified with transmission electron microscopy and genetic mutation screening, revealing total absence of dynein arms in sperm tails and homozygous mutation in the ZMYND10, heterozygous mutations in the ARMC4 and DNAH5 genes. Laser assisted viability assay (LAVA) was performed by shooting the sperm tails during sperm retrieval for microinjection, following detection of pentoxifylline resistant immotile sperm. Live births of healthy triplets, one boy and two monozygotic girls, was achieved after double blastocyst transfer.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

29511670	Whole-Exome Sequencing Identified a Novel Compound Heterozygous Mutation of LRRC6  in a Chinese Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Patient	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a clinical rare peculiar disorder, mainly featured by respiratory infection, tympanitis, nasosinusitis, and male infertility. Previous study demonstrated it is an autosomal recessive disease and by 2017 almost 40 pathologic genes have been identified. Among them are the leucine-rich repeat- (LRR-) containing 6 (LRRC6) codes for a 463-amino-acid cytoplasmic protein, expressed distinctively in motile cilia cells, including the testis cells and the respiratory epithelial cells. In this study, we applied whole-exome sequencing combined with PCD-known genes filtering to explore the genetic lesion of a PCD patient. A novel compound heterozygous mutation in LRRC6 (c.183T>G/p.N61K; c.179-1G>A) was identified and coseparated in this family. The missense mutation (c.183T>G/p.N61K) may lead to a substitution of asparagine by lysine at position 61 in exon 3 of LRRC6. The splice site mutation (c.179-1G>A) may cause a premature stop codon in exon 4 and decrease the mRNA levels of LRRC6. Both mutations were not present in our 200 local controls, dbSNP, and 1000 genomes. Three bioinformatics programs also predicted that both mutations are deleterious. Our study not only further supported the importance of LRRC6 in PCD, but also expanded the spectrum of LRRC6 mutations and will contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of PCD patients.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

A 55-year-old woman with Kartagener syndrome and chronic angle closure glaucoma presented for evaluation of the retina. Optos ultra-widefield imaging of the fundus showed glaucomatous cupping, drusen, and retinal pigment epithelium changes within the macular region. Humphrey visual field testing confirmed glaucomatous changes. Drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments were observed bilaterally with optical coherence tomography. We hypothesize that in addition to the lungs, spermatozoa and the Fallopian tubes, the retinal pigment epithelium may also be affected by ciliary dysfunction in individuals with Kartagener syndrome. Given recent advances in our knowledge of retinal ciliopathies, further studies are needed to understand how ciliary dysfunction affects the retina in Kartagener syndrome.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29552400	Novel endoscope with increased depth of field for imaging human nasal tissue by microscopic optical coherence tomography	Intravital microscopy (IVM) offers the opportunity to visualize static and dynamic changes of tissue on a cellular level. It is a valuable tool in research and may considerably improve clinical diagnosis. In contrast to confocal and non-linear microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with microscopic resolution (mOCT) provides intrinsically cross-sectional imaging. Changing focus position is not needed, which simplifies especially endoscopic imaging. For in-vivo imaging, here we are presenting endo-microscopic OCT (emOCT). A graded-index-lens (GRIN) based 2.75 mm outer diameter rigid endoscope is providing 1.5 - 2 µm nearly isotropic resolution over an extended field of depth. Spherical and chromatic aberrations are used to elongate the focus length. Simulation of the OCT image formation, suggests a better overall image quality in this range compared to a focused Gaussian beam. Total imaging depth at a reduced sensitivity and lateral resolution is more than 200 µm. Using a frame rate of 80 Hz cross-sectional images of concha nasalis were demonstrated in humans, which could resolve cilial motion, cellular structures of the epithelium, vessels and blood cells. Mucus transport velocity was successfully determined. The endoscope may be used for diagnosis and treatment control of different lung diseases like cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, which manifest already at the nasal mucosa.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Due to its nonspecific clinical features, the condition is usually diagnosed late in its course, unless situs inversus (SI) or organ laterality defects are discovered at imaging. A small subset of patients with PCD display associated organ laterality defects, different from the classical SI totalis.

29601588	ZMYND10 stabilizes intermediate chain proteins in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of dynein arms	Zinc finger MYND-type-containing 10 (ZMYND10), a cytoplasmic protein expressed in ciliated cells, causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) when mutated; however, its function is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we examined the roles of ZMYND10 using Zmynd10-/-mice exhibiting typical PCD phenotypes, including hydrocephalus and laterality defects. In these mutants, morphology, the number of motile cilia, and the 9+2 axoneme structure were normal; however, inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively) were absent. ZMYND10 interacted with ODA components and proteins, including LRRC6, DYX1C1, and C21ORF59, implicated in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of DAs, whose levels were significantly reduced in Zmynd10-/-mice. LRRC6 and DNAI1 were more stable when co-expressed with ZYMND10 than when expressed alone. DNAI2, which did not interact with ZMYND10, was not stabilized by co-expression with ZMYND10 alone, but was stabilized by co-expression with DNAI1 and ZMYND10, suggesting that ZMYND10 stabilized DNAI1, which subsequently stabilized DNAI2. Together, these results demonstrated that ZMYND10 regulated the early stage of DA cytoplasmic pre-assembly by stabilizing DNAI1.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open-reading frame C11orf70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11orf70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, as a result of the loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11orf70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11orf70 showed that C11orf70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11orf70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein-arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11orf70 is a preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of additional genetic defects that cause PCD and male infertility is of great importance for the clinic as well as for genetic counselling.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

We report feasibility of measurement and natural evolution of nasal NO and upon the impact of respiratory tract infection (RTI) on nasal NO in healthy infants (HI), followed from birth until age 2 years, with comparison to nasal NO in infant PCD.Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurements were performed at scheduled visits at 2 weeks old and at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months old, with extra visits during RTIs. Historical nasal NO measurements for infant PCD were included for comparison.Altogether, 224 nasal NO measurements were performed in 44 enrolled infants. Median newborn nasal NO was 46 ppb (interquartile range (IQR) 29-69 ppb), increasing at a rate of 5.4% per month up to 283 ppb (IQR 203-389 ppb) at the age of 2 years. RTIs in 27 out of 44 infants temporarily suppressed nasal NO by 79%. Values for nasal NO in seven infants with PCD ranged from 6-80 ppb. The success rate to accept nasal NO sampling was 223 out of 224 measurements (99.6%).Tidal-breathing nasal NO measurement was indeed feasible in infancy and nasal NO in HI increased significantly up to 2 years of age, in opposition to nasal NO in PCD cases, which stayed low past 2 years of age. RTI episodes caused marked, temporary reductions in nasal NO in HI indistinguishable from that in infant PCD, suggesting that nasal NO should be measured in RTI-free intervals.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are genetically determined diseases involving different basic defects, but both showing impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic infections and pulmonary destruction early in life. PCD is generally considered a milder disease than CF and it is hypothesized that children with CF would have consistently lower VO2peak and pulmonary function than children with PCD. We performed a prospective, observational single-center, clinical cohort study of VO2peak and pulmonary function in age and gender matched schoolchildren, at two occasions 12 months apart. VO2peak was persistently (at baseline and after 12 months) and significantly reduced in the 22 patients with PCD (z-score = -0.89 and -1.0) and 24 with CF (z-score = -0.94 and -1.1), included in the study. Abnormal VO2peak was detected in a larger proportion of children with PCD (≈30%) than CF (≈13%). Moreover, children with PCD exhibited persistently lower FEV1 (p < 0.0001 at first visit and p = 0.001 at second visit) while FEF25-75 and FVC differed only at baseline. Indeed, a retrospective analysis comparing lung function over the last year in our entire PCD and CF populations between 6 and 18 years of age, revealed lower values in patients with PCD (FEV1 z-score, p = 0.0004, FVC z-score p < 0.0001, FEF25-75 z-score p = 0.008). This is the first report indicating that cardiopulmonary fitness is equally and consistently reduced in both children with PCD and CF along with a consistent lower pulmonary function in PCD compared with CF. A certain reservation for possible selection bias and the small number of patients is necessary. However, increased focus on early diagnosis, evidence-based treatment regimens and close clinical monitoring in PCD are warranted.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29916806	ZMYND10 functions in a chaperone relay during axonemal dynein assembly.	Molecular chaperones promote the folding and macromolecular assembly of a diverse set of 'client' proteins. How ubiquitous chaperone machineries direct their activities towards specific sets of substrates is unclear. Through the use of mouse genetics, imaging and quantitative proteomics we uncover that ZMYND10 is a novel co-chaperone that confers specificity for the FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex towards axonemal dynein clients required for cilia motility. Loss of ZMYND10 perturbs the chaperoning of axonemal dynein heavy chains, triggering broader degradation of dynein motor subunits. We show that pharmacological inhibition of FKBP8 phenocopies dynein motor instability associated with the loss of ZMYND10 in airway cells and that human disease-causing variants of ZMYND10 disrupt its ability to act as an FKBP8-HSP90 co-chaperone. Our study indicates that primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), caused by mutations in dynein assembly factors disrupting cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors, should be considered a cell-type specific protein-misfolding disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

29940967	Ciliated conical epithelial cell protrusions point towards a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia can result from a number of different ciliary defects that adversely affect ciliary function resulting markedly reduced or absent mucociliary clearance. Improvement in diagnostic testing is an area of current research. During diagnostic evaluation of PCD we observed ciliated conical protrusions from part of the apical surface of ciliated cells in those diagnosed with PCD. The aim of this study was to investigate if this abnormality was specific to PCD. Epithelial edges from 67 consecutively diagnosed PCD patients, 67 patients consecutively referred for PCD diagnostic testing in whom PCD was excluded, 22 with asthma and 18 with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) were studied retrospectively in a blinded manner using light microscopy. Forty six out of 67 patients with PCD had ciliated conical epithelial protrusions, whereas none were seen in patients where PCD was excluded, or in patients with asthma or CF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the presence of the ciliated conical protrusions to predict a diagnosis of PCD were 76.5, 100, 100 and 77% respectively. Characteristic ciliated conical protrusions from ciliated epithelial cells maybe a useful pointer to the diagnosis of PCD. However, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

29992786	Neurocognitive disorders and sleep in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients have higher incidence of sleep disordered breathing which lead neurocognitive impairments such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may effect academic performance of children and may cause impairment in emotional relationships. This study aim to evaluate hyperactivity and attention deficiency in PCD patients and investigate the relationship between sleep and hyperactivity and attention deficiency in PCD patients. Fifteen PCD patients aged 8-18 years and 31 age-matched healthy controls were compared. Ear, nose, and throat examination and home sleep testing were performed in PCD patients. Pediatric sleep questionnaire, Conners' Parents and Teacher scale and Stroop test were applied in both groups in order to investigate the relation between sleep disordered breathing and ADHD in PCD children. PCD patients had chronic rhinosinusitis (100%), tonsillar hypertrophy (80%) and adenoidal hypertrophy (60%). FEF25-75 was low in pulmonary function test. Sixty percent of the PCD patients had mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in home sleep testing. Mean AHI was 1.54 ± 0.27. Compared with the controls PCD patients had higher PSQ scores. Hyperactivity scores on Conners' Parents scale and inattention findings in Stroop test were higher in PCD patients than the healthy controls (P < 0.05). Most of PCD children had mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Hyperactivity and inattention findings were higher in PCD patients. Sleep disordered breathing assessment should be a routine part of PCD patients management and these patients should be carefully monitored in terms of hyperactivity and inattention.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

29997923	Next-generation sequencing for identifying genetic mutations in adults with bronchiectasis	Defective airway host-defense (e.g., altered mucus properties, ciliary defects) contributes to the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. This study aims to determine whether genetic mutations associated with defective airway host-defense are implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Based on the systematic screening of 32 frequently reported bronchiectasis-associated genes, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on peripheral blood samples from 192 bronchiectasis patients and 100 healthy subjects. The variant distribution frequency and pathogenicity of mutations were analyzed. We identified 162 rare variants in 192 bronchiectasis patients, and 85 rare variants among 100 healthy subjects. Among bronchiectasis patients, 25 (15.4%), 117 (72.2%) and 18 (11.1%) rare variants were associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR), epithelial sodium channel, and primary ciliary dyskinesia genes, respectively. Biallelic CFTR variants were detected in four bronchiectasis patients but none of the healthy subjects. Carriers of homozygous p.M470 plus at least one CFTR rare variant were detected in 6.3% of bronchiectasis patients (n=12) and in 1.0% of healthy subjects (n=1, P=0.039). Twenty-six patients (16 with idiopathic and 6 with post-infectious bronchiectasis) harbored biallelic variants. Bronchiectasis patients with biallelic DNAH5 variants, or biallelic CFTR variants plus an epithelial sodium channel variant, tended to have greater disease severity. Genetic mutations leading to impaired host-defense might have implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Genetic screening may be a useful tool for unraveling the underlying causes of bronchiectasis, and offers molecular information which is complementary to conventional etiologic assessment for bronchiectasis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

30021461	Variation in treatment strategies for the eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in primary ciliary dyskinesia across European centers	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease causing motile cilia dysfunction, recurrent airway infection, and bronchiectasis. Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey® to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

30023402	Comparison of different analysis algorithms to calculate multiple-breath washout outcomes	Lung clearance index (LCI) is the main outcome of the multiple-breath washout (MBW) test. Current recommendations for LCI acquisition are based on low-grade evidence. The aim of this study was to challenge those recommendations using alternative methods for LCI analysis. Nitrogen MBW measurements from school-aged children, 20 healthy controls, 20 with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 17 with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), were analysed using 1) current algorithms (standard), 2) three alternative algorithms to detect with higher precision the end of MBW testing and 3) two alternative algorithms to determine exhaled tracer gas concentrations. LCI values, intra-test repeatability, and ability to discriminate between health and lung disease were compared between these methods. The analysis methods strongly influenced LCI (mean±sd overall differences (%) between standard and alternative analysis methods: -4.9±5.7%; range: -66-19%), but did not improve intra-test variability. Discrimination between health and disease was comparable as areas under the receiver operator curves were not greater than that from standard analysis. This study supports current recommendations for LCI calculation in children. Alternative methods influence LCI estimates and hamper comparability between MBW setups. Alternative algorithms, whenever used, should be carefully reported.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	0.2.

30032860	Comparative proteomics of respiratory exosomes in cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and asthma	Cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are pulmonary genetic disorders associated with inflammation and heterogeneous progression of the lung disease. We hypothesized that respiratory exosomes, nanovesicles circulating in the respiratory tract, may be involved in the progression of inflammation-related lung damage. We compared proteomic content of respiratory exosomes isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in CF and PCD to asthma (A), a condition also associated with inflammation but with less severe lung damage. BALF were obtained from 3 CF, 3 PCD and 6 A patients. Exosomes were isolated from BALF by ultracentrifugations and characterized using immunoelectron microscopy and western-blot. Exosomal protein analysis was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry using label-free quantification. Exosome enrichment was validated by electron microscopy and immunodetection of CD9, CD63 and ALIX. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the quantification of 665 proteins, of which 14 were statistically differential according to the disease. PCD and CF exosomes contained higher levels of antioxidant proteins (Superoxide-dismutase, Glutathione peroxidase-3, Peroxiredoxin-5) and proteins involved in leukocyte chemotaxis. All these proteins are known activators of the NF-KappaB pathway. Our results suggest that respiratory exosomes are involved in the pro-inflammatory propagation during the extension of CF or PCD lung diseases. The mechanism of local propagation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is not clearly understood.

We calculated z-scores and % predicted values for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) using the Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 values for 991 patients from the international PCD Cohort. We then assessed associations with age, sex, country, diagnostic certainty, organ laterality, body mass index and age at diagnosis in linear regression models. Lung function in PCD patients was reduced compared to reference values in both sexes and all age groups. Children aged 6-9 years had the smallest impairment (FEV1 z-score -0.84 (-1.03 to -0.65), FVC z-score -0.31 (-0.51 to -0.11)). Compared to CF patients, FEV1 was similarly reduced in children (age 6-9 years PCD 91% (88-93%); CF 90% (88-91%)), but less impaired in young adults (age 18-21 years PCD 79% (76-82%); CF 66% (65-68%)).

30151187	Bronchiectasis in PCD looks different to CF on CT scan	The contemporary diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires CT scanning to describe specific structural lung changes. Scoring systems have been designed and validated in some specific causes of bronchiectasis to allow investigators to correlate CT changes with other indices of disease severity, to describe changes over time, with exacerbation and in response to treatment. Several scoring systems have been developed for CF including the Bhalla Score, Brody score, and the Helbich score. These scoring systems have also been applied to other causes of bronchiectasis including Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). This assumes that the nature of structural lung disease in these conditions, as well as the rate and nature of longitudinal changes are identical to, or at least very similar to, those found in CF. This assumption has not been tested. The underlying pathophysiology of PCD is not the same as CF and may cause bronchiectasis that is radiologically similar but not necessarily the same as CF or any other cause of bronchiectasis. The development of a disease specific scoring system for structural change in cases of non-CF bronchiectasis due to any cause, would require consideration of the full range of changes seen in that condition without reference to changes seen in other conditions. We present a summary of structural findings that have been described in PCD and highlight the radiological differences between PCD and other causes of bronchiectasis. We suggest that a PCD specific CT scoring system is required to properly describe changes seen in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

We previously demonstrated that mouse models of PCD lacking ciliary proteins CFAP221, CFAP54 and SPEF2 all have hydrocephalus with a strain-dependent severity. While morphological defects are more severe on the C57BL/6J (B6) background than 129S6/SvEvTac (129), cerebrospinal fluid flow is perturbed on both backgrounds, suggesting that abnormal cilia-driven flow is not the only factor underlying the hydrocephalus phenotype. Here, we performed a microarray analysis on brains from wild type and nm1054 mice lacking CFAP221 on the B6 and 129 backgrounds. Expression differences were observed for a number of genes that cluster into distinct groups based on expression pattern and biological function, many of them implicated in cellular and biochemical processes essential for proper brain development. These include genes known to be functionally relevant to congenital hydrocephalus, as well as formation and function of both motile and sensory cilia. Identification of these genes provides important clues to mechanisms underlying congenital hydrocephalus severity.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	2.3.

30238669	The prevalence of the defining features of primary ciliary dyskinesia within a cri du chat syndrome cohort	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) are distinct disorders that can co-occur due to a common genetic locus on chromosome 5p. Chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD can occur in CdCS and are typically attributed to hypotonia, dysphagia, and aspiration. The prevalence of PCD among individuals with CdCS is not known. An online survey assessing common features of PCD was distributed to members of the 5P Minus Society, a cri du chat patient advocacy group. Respondents who met criteria for elevated risk of PCD (at least 3 symptoms or other features highly suggestive of PCD) were offered PCD genetic testing. For the 123 respondents (median age 10.1 years with IQR 5.5-17.3 years; from 33 U.S. states and 10 other countries) chronic respiratory symptoms associated with PCD were prevalent, including unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, year-round nasal congestion beginning in infancy, and year-round, wet cough beginning in infancy in 35%, 32%, and 20% of respondents, respectively. Fifteen respondents (12%) met criteria for elevated risk for PCD and completed genetic analysis; however, none were diagnostic for PCD. A PCD clinical center evaluated an additional subject with CdCS who met criteria for likely PCD and had negative genetics, but had diagnostic electron microscopy of the respiratory cilia (missing outer dynein arms). Clinicians should be aware of the genetic connection between CdCS and PCD. Non-informative genetic testing does not rule out PCD. CdCS patients with chronic respiratory symptoms may benefit from referral to specialized PCD diagnostic centers.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2. RELATED DISEASES	1.1.

30293640	Thoraco-Abdominal Abnormalities in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome: Situs Inversus and Heterotaxy	To characterize the diversity and prevalence of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a model ciliopathy for understanding the role of cilia in human health. The Clinical Registry Investigating BBS, a worldwide registry exploring the phenotype and natural history of BBS, was used to conduct the study. Protected health information was obtained by subject or family interview and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved release of data including imaging studies and genetic testing. Echocardiography and imaging findings were independently confirmed by 2 cardiologists. Thoraco-abdominal abnormalities were identified in 6 of 368 (1.6%) subjects with a minimum prevalence of 1 in 60 Clinical Registry Investigating BBS participants. Diverse laterality defects were observed suggesting that the underlying ciliopathy randomly alters embryonic left-right axis orientation. Congenital heart disease, common in heterotaxy, was present in 2 subjects. Additional defects, uncommonly reported in BBS, were observed in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems in the subjects. No BBS genotype was favored in the cohort. One subject had genetic and clinical phenotype diagnostic of both primary ciliary dyskinesia and BBS. The variety of thoraco-abdominal abnormalities in BBS suggests the pleiotropic nature of these anomalies is not confined to a single pattern or genotype. Clinicians providing care to individuals with BBS should consider the increased prevalence of thoraco-abdominal anomalies in BBS. Individuals with features suggestive of other ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, should undergo further evaluation for additional genetic disorders.

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from dermal fibroblasts of a female PCD patient carrying disease-causing variants in the CCDC40 gene. Reprogramming was performed with the human OSKM transcription factors using the Sendai-virus delivery system. The resulting transgene free iPSCs had normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, could differentiate into the three germ layers in vivo and retained the disease-causing CCDC40 mutations. This iPSC line could be useful to model PCD disease and test gene therapy strategies. Resource Table.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

30368395	Adenoid hypertrophy affects screening for primary ciliary dyskinesia using nasal nitric oxide	In patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the release of nitric oxide (NO) is extremely low by epithelia of the nasopharynx and sinuses. Measurement of nasal NO (nNO) is recommended as a screening test for PCD. The study aimed to evaluate if adenoids affects nNO and may deteriorate the performance of the test. In 48 nonallergic patients between 5 and 18 years of age with chronic symptoms of nasal obstruction and indications for adenoidectomy, the measurements of nNO by chemiluminescence analyser and nasal patency by active anterior rhinomanometry were performed both before and after adenoidectomy. Adenoidal tissue size was graded during surgery under general anaesthesia using transoral endoscopy. Patients were stratified into groups with adenoids grades 1, 2 and 3 (<1/3, 1/3-2/3 and > 2/3 of the choana and post-nasal space covered by adenoids). Before adenoidectomy, the median of nNO decreased with the increasing grade of adenoids (920, 663, and 491 ppb, P < 0.05). The rhinomanometry results were comparable and showed no correlation with nNO. Seven patients (14.6%) were incorrectly classified to have PCD based on a subthreshold value of the volume flow of nNO (FnNO < 77 nL/min). Following adenoidectomy, nNO of the grade 3 patients increased by 107 ppb (P < 0.05) and no differences were found between groups (P = 0.40). All patients had the postadenoidectomy FnNO >77 nL/min. nNO and FnNO are reduced in nonallergic children with obstructive adenoids. Adenoid hypertrophy can potentially cause a false positive result of the test for PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

30368402	A comparative study between adenoids and nasal mucosa for ciliated epithelium in children with recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis	To determine whether adenoid epithelium is superior to nasal mucosa for biopsy of ciliated epithelium for electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate pediatric patients with rhinosinusitis for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A retrospective review compared electron microscopic results in children with chronic or recurrent rhinosinusitis who underwent both adenoidectomy or nasopharyngeal biopsy and nasal mucosa biopsy in the course of evaluation for PCD at a tertiary care institution. Forty pediatric patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Nine of these patients had a prior adenoidectomy and therefore underwent nasopharyngeal biopsy for collection of adenoid tissue. All nine of the nasopharyngeal biopsies and 25 of the 31 (80.6%) adenoid biopsies had sufficient cilia for EM evaluation of the ultrastructure. Of the 40 patients who also had a nasal biopsy, only 12 (30.0%) had sufficient cilia for EM analysis. The distribution of sufficient versus insufficient cilia for analysis between adenoid and nasal mucosa was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Abnormal cilia were found in only 2.5% of our patients. In current practice, the nasal cavity is a common location for obtaining ciliated epithelium for EM analysis, as it is easily accessible for biopsy and the procedure itself causes relatively low patient morbidity. Chronic rhinosinusitis, however, has been associated with decreased cilia density on nasal respiratory epithelium. Given that adenoidectomies are often performed in children with chronic rhinosinusitis, our data suggest that adenoid tissue is a better source of ciliated tissue for analysis compared to turbinate epithelium.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

30431343	Emerging Concepts and Therapies for Mucoobstructive Lung Disease	"A spectrum of intrapulmonary airway diseases, for example, cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, can be categorized as ""mucoobstructive"" airway diseases. A common theme for these diseases appears to be the failure to properly regulate mucus concentration, producing mucus hyperconcentration that slows mucus transport and, importantly, generates plaque/plug adhesion to airway surfaces. These mucus plaques/plugs generate long diffusion distances for oxygen, producing hypoxic niches within adherent airway mucus and subjacent epithelia. Data suggest that concentrated mucus plaques/plugs are proinflammatory, in part mediated by release of IL-1α from hypoxic cells. The infectious component of mucoobstructive diseases may be initiated by anaerobic bacteria that proliferate within the nutrient-rich hypoxic mucus environment. Anaerobes ultimately may condition mucus to provide the environment for a succession to classic airway pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and ultimately Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Novel therapies to treat mucoobstructive diseases focus on restoring mucus concentration. Strategies to rehydrate mucus range from the inhalation of osmotically active solutes, designed to draw water into airway surfaces, to strategies designed to manipulate the relative rates of sodium absorption versus chloride secretion to endogenously restore epithelial hydration. Similarly, strategies designed to reduce the mucin burden in the airways, either by reducing mucin production/secretion or by clearing accumulated mucus (e.g., reducing agents), are under development. Thus, the new insights into a unifying process, that is, mucus hyperconcentration, that drives a significant component of the pathogenesis of mucoobstructive diseases promise multiple new therapeutic strategies to aid patients with this syndrome."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.1.

She was finally diagnosed with biopsy-proven immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy. KS constitutes a subgroup of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) characterized by structural and/or functional ciliary abnormalities resulting in sinopulmonary involvement with varying severity. Our case does not allow us to corroborate the clinical impact of KS and/or PCD as a pathogenic basis for the IgA nephropathy, and each disease might develop independently. However, systematic studies on this topic are quite lacking, so we strongly recommend the accumulation of more cases similar to our own, which would allow us to clarify the nature of this disease state more precisely.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

30665704	Lack of GAS2L2 Causes PCD by Impairing Cilia Orientation and Mucociliary Clearance	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder in which impaired ciliary function leads to chronic airway disease. Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs∗13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2). Further genetic screening of unrelated PCD subjects identified a second proband with a compound heterozygous variant carrying the identical frameshift variant and a large deletion (c.867_∗343+1207del; p.?) starting in exon 5. Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8 Hz versus control = 15.8 Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2-/- mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X. laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

30691261	The Swiss Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia registry: objectives, methods and first results	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, hereditary, multiorgan disease caused by defects in the structure and function of motile cilia. It results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly in the upper and lower airways. Central data collection in national and international registries is essential to studying the epidemiology of rare diseases and filling in gaps in knowledge of diseases such as PCD. For this reason, the Swiss Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Registry (CH-PCD) was founded in 2013 as a collaborative project between epidemiologists and adult and paediatric pulmonologists. We describe the objectives and methodology of the CH-PCD, present initial results, and give an overview of current and ongoing projects.  The registry records patients of any age, suffering from PCD, who are treated and resident in Switzerland. It collects information from patients identified through physicians, diagnostic facilities and patient organisations. The registry dataset contains data on diagnostic evaluations, lung function, microbiology and imaging, symptoms, treatments and hospitalisations.  By May 2018, CH-PCD has contacted 566 physicians of different specialties and identified 134 patients with PCD. At present, this number represents an overall 1 in 63,000 prevalence of people diagnosed with PCD in Switzerland. Prevalence differs by age and region; it is highest in children and adults younger than 30 years, and in Espace Mittelland. The median age of patients in the registry is 25 years (range 5–73), and 41 patients have a definite PCD diagnosis based on recent international guidelines. Data from CH-PCD are contributed to international collaborative studies and the registry facilitates patient identification for nested studies.  CH-PCD has proven to be a valuable research tool that already has highlighted weaknesses in PCD clinical practice in Switzerland.

We investigated whether tidal breathing sampling for a few seconds was as discriminative between PCD and healthy controls (HC) as conventional tidal breathing sampling (cTB-nNO) for 20-30 s. We performed very rapid sampling of tidal breathing (vrTB-nNO) for 2, 4 and 6 s, respectively. Vacuum sampling with applied negative pressure (vrTB-nNOvac; negative pressure was applied by pinching the sampling tube) for < 2 s resulted in enhanced suction of nasal air during measurement. Feasibility, success rate, discriminatory capacity, repeatability and agreement were assessed for all four sampling modalities. We included 13 patients with PCD, median (IQR) age of 21.8 (12.2-27.7) years and 17 HC, 25.3 (14.5-33.4) years. Measurements were highly feasible (96.7% success rate). Measured NO values with vrTB-nNO modalities differed significantly from TB-nNO measurements (HC: p < 0.001, PCD: p < 0.05). All modalities showed excellent discrimination. The vacuum method gave remarkably high values of nNO in both groups (1865 vs. 86 ppb), but retained excellent discrimination. vrTB-nNO4sec, vrTB-nNO6sec and vrTB-nNOvac showed identical specificity to cTB-nNO (all: 1.0, 95% CI 0.77-1.0). vrTB-nNO sampling requires only a few seconds of probe-in-nose time, is feasible, and provides excellent discrimination between PCD and HC. Rapid TB-nNO sampling needs standardisation and further investigations in infants, young children and patients referred for PCD workup.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

30774648	Survey of the Ciliary Motility Machinery of Drosophila  Sperm and Ciliated Mechanosensory Neurons Reveals Unexpected Cell-Type Specific Variations: A Model for Motile Ciliopathies	"The motile cilium/flagellum is an ancient eukaryotic organelle. The molecular machinery of ciliary motility comprises a variety of cilium-specific dynein motor complexes along with other complexes that regulate their activity. Assembling the motors requires the function of dedicated ""assembly factors"" and transport processes. In humans, mutation of any one of at least 40 different genes encoding components of the motility apparatus causes Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of defective ciliary motility. Recently, Drosophila has emerged as a model for motile cilia biology and motile ciliopathies. This is somewhat surprising as most Drosophila cells lack cilia, and motile cilia are confined to just two specialized cell types: the sperm flagellum with a 9+2 axoneme and the ciliated dendrite of auditory/proprioceptive (chordotonal, Ch) neurons with a 9+0 axoneme. To determine the utility of Drosophila as a model for motile cilia, we survey the Drosophila genome for ciliary motility gene homologs, and assess their expression and function. We find that the molecules of cilium motility are well conserved in Drosophila. Most are readily characterized by their restricted cell-type specific expression patterns and phenotypes. There are also striking differences between the two motile ciliated cell types. Notably, sperm and Ch neuron cilia express and require entirely different outer dynein arm variants-the first time this has been clearly established in any organism. These differences might reflect the specialized functions for motility in the two cilium types. Moreover, the Ch neuron cilia lack the critical two-headed inner arm dynein (I1/f) but surprisingly retain key regulatory proteins previously associated with it. This may have implications for other motile 9+0 cilia, including vertebrate embryonic nodal cilia required for left-right axis asymmetry. We discuss the possibility that cell-type specificity in ciliary motility machinery might occur in humans, and therefore underlie some of the phenotypic variation observed in PCD caused by different gene mutations. Our work lays the foundation for the increasing use of Drosophila as an excellent model for new motile ciliary gene discovery and validation, for understanding motile cilium function and assembly, as well as understanding the nature of genetic defects underlying human motile ciliopathies."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

Genomic DNA of the child and her parents was extracted and subjected to targeted gene capture and next generation sequencing. Suspected mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing, with its nature and impact predicted by Bioinformatic analysis. Clinical manifestations of the child mainly included severe pneumonia, bronchiectasia, nasosinusitis and pneumothorax. DNA sequencing showed that she has carried compound heterozygous mutations of the CCNO gene, namely c.848T>C (p.L283P) and c.262\_263 insGGCCCGGCCC (p.Q88Rfs\*51), which were respectively inherited from her mother and father. The child was diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia caused by the compound heterozygous mutations of the CCNO gene.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

30881373	Identification of Important Effector Proteins in the FOXJ1 Transcriptional Network Associated With Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Function	Developmental defects in motile cilia, arising from genetic abnormalities in one or more ciliary genes, can lead to a common ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Functional studies in model organisms undertaken to understand PCD or cilia biogenesis have identified 100s of genes regulated by Foxj1, the master regulator of motile ciliogenesis. However, limited systems based studies have been performed to elucidate proteins or network/s crucial to the motile ciliary interactome, although this approach holds promise for identification of multiple cilia-associated genes, which, in turn, could be utilized for screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Here, based on the assumption that FOXJ1-mediated regulatory and signaling networks are representative of the motile cilia interactome, we have constructed and analyzed the gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) mediated by FOXJ1. The predicted FOXJ1 regulatory network comprises of 424 directly and 148 indirectly regulated genes. Additionally, based on gene ontology analysis, we have associated 17 directly and 6 indirectly regulated genes with possible ciliary roles. Topological and perturbation analyses of the PPIN (6927 proteins, 40,608 interactions) identified 121 proteins expressed in ciliated cells, which interact with multiple proteins encoded by FoxJ1 induced genes (FIG) as important interacting proteins (IIP). However, it is plausible that IIP transcriptionally regulated by FOXJ1 and/or differentially expressed in PCD are likely to have crucial roles in motile cilia. We have found 20 de-regulated topologically important effector proteins in the FOXJ1 regulatory network, among which some (PLSCR1, SSX2IP, ACTN2, CDC42, HSP90AA1, PIAS4) have previously reported ciliary roles. Furthermore, based on pathway enrichment of these proteins and their primary interactors, we have rationalized their possible roles in the ciliary interactome. For instance, 5 among these novel proteins that are involved in cilia associated signaling pathways (like Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Toll-like receptor etc.) could be 'topologically important signaling proteins.' Therefore, based on this FOXJ1 network study we have predicted important effectors in the motile cilia interactome, which are possibly associated with ciliary biology and/or function and are likely to further our understanding of the pathophysiology in ciliopathies like PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

Uncinate process (UP) angulation measurements in patients and controls to objectify this bulging. Thirty CF, 17 primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), 13 chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwp), and 30 controls were included. Angles were measured bilaterally on computed tomography (CT) scans: A, B, C on coronal sections, D and E on axial sections. Angle A was between the UP and the orbit inner wall, whereas the others were between UP and midline. There was no significant difference between controls, PCD, and CRSwp. However, CF had 3 statistically different angles with controls, 5 with CRSwp, and 4 with PCD. Angle A average value was 126° (±16°) in patients with CF, 138° (±19°) in controls ( P = .007), 145° (±15°) in PCD ( P = .001), and 138° (±14°) in CRSwp ( P = .001). Angle E average value was 35° (±10°) in patients with CF, 20° (±6°) in controls ( P < .001), 21° (±4°) in PCD ( P < .001), and 22° (±6°) in CRSwp ( P < .001).

31012247	The impact of mannose-binding lectin polymorphisms on lung function in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a congenital lung disease that leads to recurrent and chronic lung infection. The resulting inflammation causes lung damage and declines in lung function. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a first line host defense protein of importance for the innate immunity. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene named MBL2 result in unstable and low functional levels MBL proteins. MBL insufficiency is linked to an increased risk of lung infection and to declines in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. We investigated whether there is a similar link in patients with PCD. This retrospective longitudinal study included 85 patients with PCD. Diagnostics and age at diagnosis were recorded, complete spirometry data starting at diagnosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status over the last 2 years were collected, and the patients were grouped according to MBL2 genotype status (MBL2-sufficient or MBL2-deficient). MBL-deficient patients were diagnosed almost 3 years earlier than MBL-sufficient patients (median 6.1 vs 8.9 years, P  < 0.05). There were no differences in the first measured spirometry values, but MBL-deficient patients showed greater declines in forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1 ) than patients with MBL sufficiency (z-score: -0.049 per year [95% CI, -0.075; -0.021] vs -0.009 per year [95% CI, -0.033; 0.015]; P = 0.023). No differences were found in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, or infection status. MBL-deficiency, which is associated with MBL2 mutations, was associated with a lower age at diagnosis and with steeper declines in FEV1 in patients with PCD. This suggests that the MBL genotype might be a disease modifier in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31019772	Additional role of bronchial mucosal biopsy for ciliary structural abnormality in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of diagnostic tests for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The mucosal samples obtained for cilia examination are generally procured from the nasal turbinate, but these specimens often yield inadequate results. The bronchial mucosa is recognized as an alternative sample, but no study has examined the additional utility of bronchial mucosa compared with nasal mucosa in the diagnosis of PCD. The medical records of 96 patients who underwent TEM for suspected PCD between April 1997 and June 2017 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on the site of mucosal biopsy: nasal biopsy (NB) group with nasal mucosal biopsy only; bronchial biopsy (BB) group with bronchial mucosal biopsy only; and nasal and bronchial biopsy (NBB) group with a combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsies. The rate of PCD diagnosis was 28.8% (17/59) in the NB group, 41.2% (7/17) in the BB group, and 60.0% (12/20) in the NBB group. The yield of PCD diagnosis significantly increased in the NBB group compared with the NB group (P=0.012). In the NBB group, 25.0% (5/20) of patients were diagnosed with PCD by nasal mucosal biopsy, and 35.0% (7/20) of patients were additionally diagnosed by bronchial mucosal biopsy. The presence of sinusitis or bronchiectasis was not associated with prediction of PCD diagnosis from nasal or bronchial mucosal biopsy. The combination of nasal and bronchial mucosal biopsy for TEM showed higher yields of PCD diagnosis than nasal mucosal biopsy alone.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31092556	Proteome of the central apparatus of a ciliary axoneme	"Nearly all motile cilia have a ""9+2"" axoneme containing a central apparatus (CA), consisting of two central microtubules with projections, that is essential for motility. To date, only 22 proteins are known to be CA components. To identify new candidate CA proteins, we used mass spectrometry to compare axonemes of wild-type Chlamydomonas and a CA-less mutant. We identified 44 novel candidate CA proteins, of which 13 are conserved in humans. Five of the latter were studied more closely, and all five localized to the CA; therefore, most of the other candidates are likely to also be CA components. Our results reveal that the CA is far more compositionally complex than previously recognized and provide a greatly expanded knowledge base for studies to understand the architecture of the CA and how it functions. The discovery of the new conserved CA proteins will facilitate genetic screening to identify patients with a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia that has been difficult to diagnose."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31128603	Asthma as aetiology of bronchiectasis in Finland	By definition bronchiectasis (BE) means destructed structure of normal bronchus as a consequence of frequent bacterial infections and inflammation. In many senses, BE is a neglected orphan disease. A recent pan-European registry study, EMBARC, has been set up in order to better understand its pathophysiology, better phenotype patients, and to individualize their management. To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland. Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study. Baseline demographics, lung functions, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data, together with co-morbidities were entered into EMBARC database. Clinical characteristics, aetiologic factors, co-morbidities, and risk factors for extensive BE were explored. To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD ± 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1). Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2. RELATED DISEASES		422	... . In many senses, BE is a neglected orphan disease. A recent pan-European registry study, EMBARC, has been set up in order to better understand its pathophysiology, better phenotype patients, and to individualize their management. To examine the aetiology and co-morbidity of BE in the capital area in Finland. Two hundred five patients with BE diagnosis and follow up visits between 2016 and 2017 in Helsinki University Hospital were invited to participate in the study. Baseline demographics, lung functions, imaging, microbiological, and therapeutic data, together with co-morbidities were entered into EMBARC database. Clinical characteristics, aetiologic factors, co-morbidities, and risk factors for extensive BE were explored. To the study included 95 adult patients and seventy nine percent of the BE patients were women. The mean age was 69 years (SD ± 13). Asthma was a comorbid condition in 68% of the patients but in 26% it was estimated to be the cause of BE. Asthma was aetiological factor for BE if it had been diagnosed earlier than BE. As 41% BE were idiopathic, in 11% the disorder was postinfectious and others were associated to rheumatic disease, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, IgG deficiency and Kartagener syndrome. The most common co-morbidities in addition to asthma were cardiovascular disease (30%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26%), overweight (22%), diabetes (16%), inactive neoplasia (15%), and immunodeficiency (12%). Extensive BE was found in 68% of BE patients in whom four or more lobes were affected. Risk factors for extensive BE were asthma (OR 2.7), asthma as aetiology for BE (OR 4.3), and rhinosinusitis (OR 3.1). Asthma was associated to BE in 68% and it was estimated as aetiology in every fourth patient. However, retrospectively, it is difficult to exclude asthma as a background cause in patients with asthma-like symptoms and respiratory infections. We propose asthma as an aetiology factor for BE if it is diagnosed earlier than BE. Asthma and rhinosinusitis were predictive for extensive BE.
31160482	Association of DNAH11  gene polymorphisms with asthenozoospermia in Northeast Chinese patients	Reduced or no progressive sperm motility in the fresh ejaculate defines asthenozoospermia as one of the major causes of male infertility. The axonemal heavy chain dynein type 11 (DNAH11) gene encodes for one of the axonemal dynein heavy chain (DHC) family members and participates in assembling respiratory cilia and sperm flagella. Given the high degree of conservation of DNAH11, mutations could give rise to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and asthenozoospermia. To date, few studies have reported on the association between variants in DNAH11 and asthenozoospermia. In the present study, 87 patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia for variants in DNAH11 were screened by using high-throughput targeted gene sequencing technology. Bioinformatics analysis was further assessed. We found compound heterozygous variants (c.9484-1 G>T, c.12428 T>C) of DNAH11 detected in 1 of 87 patients. The variant c.9484-1 G>T was confirmed as a novel virulence variant which was predicted to affect splicing by Human Splicing Finder 3.1. And c.12428 T>C was predicted to be mildly pathogenic in silico analysis. We found that DNAH11 polymorphisms display strong associations with asthenozoospermia, and may contribute to an increased risk of male infertility in Chinese patients.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31213628	Severe pulmonary disease in an adult primary ciliary dyskinesia population in Brazil	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is underdiagnosed in Brazil. We enrolled patients from an adult service of Bronchiectasis over a two-year period in a cross-sectional study. The inclusion criteria were laterality disorders (LD), cough with recurrent infections and the exclusion of other causes of bronchiectasis. Patients underwent at least two of the following tests: nasal nitric oxide, ciliary movement and analysis of ciliary immunofluorescence, and genetic tests (31 PCD genes + CFTR gene). The clinical characterization included the PICADAR and bronchiectasis scores, pulmonary function, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cPA) colonization, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and mucus rheology (MR). Forty-nine of the 500 patients were diagnosed with definite (42/49), probable (5/49), and clinical (2/49) PCD. Twenty-four patients (24/47) presented bi-allelic pathogenic variants in a total of 31 screened PCD genes. A PICADAR score > 5 was found in 37/49 patients, consanguinity in 27/49, LD in 28/49, and eight PCD sibling groups. FACED diagnosed 23/49 patients with moderate or severe bronchiectasis; FEV1 ≤ 50% in 25/49 patients, eight patients had undergone lung transplantation, four had been lobectomized and cPA+ was determined in 20/49. The EBC and MR were altered in all patients. This adult PCD population was characterized by consanguinity, severe lung impairment, genetic variability, altered EBC and MR.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31240264	Calaxin is required for cilia-driven determination of vertebrate laterality	Calaxin is a Ca2+-binding dynein-associated protein that regulates flagellar and ciliary movement. In ascidians, calaxin plays essential roles in chemotaxis of sperm. However, nothing has been known for the function of calaxin in vertebrates. Here we show that the mice with a null mutation in Efcab1, which encodes calaxin, display typical phenotypes of primary ciliary dyskinesia, including hydrocephalus, situs inversus, and abnormal motility of trachea cilia and sperm flagella. Strikingly, both males and females are viable and fertile, indicating that calaxin is not essential for fertilization in mice. The 9 + 2 axonemal structures of epithelial multicilia and sperm flagella are normal, but the formation of 9 + 0 nodal cilia is significantly disrupted. Knockout of calaxin in zebrafish also causes situs inversus due to the irregular ciliary beating of Kupffer's vesicle cilia, although the 9 + 2 axonemal structure appears to remain normal.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.2.

31273583	Characterization of CCDC103 expression profiles: further insights in primary ciliary dyskinesia and in human reproduction	To study CCDC103 expression profiles and understand how pathogenic variants in CCDC103 affect its expression profile at mRNA and protein level. To increase the knowledge about the CCDC103, we attempted genotype-phenotype correlations in two patients carrying novel homozygous (missense and frameshift) CCDC103 variants. Whole-exome sequencing, quantitative PCR, Western blot, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunogold labelling were performed to characterize CCDC103 expression profiles in reproductive and somatic cells. Our data demonstrate that pathogenic variants in CCDC103 gene negatively affect gene and protein expression in both patients who presented absence of DA on their axonemes. Further, we firstly report that CCDC103 is expressed at different levels in reproductive tissues and somatic cells and described that CCDC103 protein forms oligomers with tissue-specific sizes, which suggests that CCDC103 possibly undergoes post-translational modifications. Moreover, we reported that CCDC103 was restricted to the midpiece of sperm and is present at the cytoplasm of the other cells. Overall, our data support the CCDC103 involvement in PCD and suggest that CCDC103 may have different assemblies and roles in cilia and sperm flagella biology that are still unexplored.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31345208	Primary ciliary dyskinesia in Japan: systematic review and meta-analysis	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder. Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] ≥ 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31345831	Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in a patient with situs inversus totalis  and Kartagener syndrome: an unusual surgical conundrum	Kartagener syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition. Approximately 25% of those with situs inversus totalis suffer the syndrome. With the rising overall number and indications for bariatric surgery, this condition will be increasingly recognised. We present a case of a 25-year-old woman with SIT and Kartagener syndrome who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. As with all bariatric surgery, a multidisciplinary team approach was important in managing such a case. There were considerable cognitive challenges for the surgical team both preoperatively and during the procedure. The patient tolerated the operation well and was discharged 2 days after the surgery. At 12-months follow-up, the patient had achieved 125% excess weight loss. This case illustrates that an experienced surgeon can safely perform a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on a patient with situs inversus totalis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31366608	Truncating mutations in exons 20 and 21 of OFD1  can cause primary ciliary dyskinesia without associated syndromic symptoms	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a motile ciliopathy, whose symptoms include airway infections, male infertility and situs inversus. Apart from the typical forms of PCD, rare syndromic PCD forms exist. Mutations of the X-linked OFD1 gene cause several syndromic ciliopathies, including oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome type 10 (JBTS10), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2, the latter causing the X-linked syndromic form of PCD. Neurological and skeletal symptoms are characteristic for these syndromes, with their severity depending on the location of the mutation within the gene. To elucidate the role of motile cilia defects in the respiratory phenotype of PCD patients with C-terminal OFD1 mutations. Whole-exome sequencing in a group of 120 Polish PCD patients, mutation screening of the OFD1 coding sequence, analysis of motile cilia, and magnetic resonance brain imaging. Four novel hemizygous OFD1 mutations, in exons 20 and 21, were found in men with a typical PCD presentation but without severe neurological, skeletal or renal symptoms characteristic for other OFD1-related syndromes. Magnetic resonance brain imaging in two patients did not show a molar tooth sign typical for JBTS10. Cilia in the respiratory epithelium were sparse, unusually long and displayed a defective motility pattern. Consistent with the literature, truncations of the C-terminal part of OFD1 (exons 16-22) almost invariably cause a respiratory phenotype (due to motile cilia defects) while their impact on the primary cilia function is limited. We suggest that exons 20-21 should be included in the panel for regular mutation screening in PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.1.

Histopathological examination of duodenum and large intestine biopsies showed amyloid A (AA) amyloid deposition. Scintigraphy and alpha-1 anti-trypsin clearance evaluations revealed protein-losing gastroenteropathy. Computed tomography with contrast and positron emission tomography showed a pelvic mass with multiple para-aortic lymph node enlargement. We suspected protein-losing gastroenteropathy secondary to AA amyloid produced related to malignant tumours. Following tumour resection, histopathological examination of the lesion revealed undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown origin. Postoperatively, the patient's nutritional condition improved. There has been no recurrence of protein-losing gastroenteropathy 6 months postoperatively. This is the first report of protein-losing gastroenteropathy and AA amyloidosis secondary to undifferentiated carcinoma. Early recognition and intervention could increase the likelihood of amyloidosis remission.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

31443223	Clinical and Genetic Analysis of Children with Kartagener Syndrome	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dysfunction of motile cilia causing ineffective mucus clearance and organ laterality defects. In this study, two unrelated Portuguese children with strong PCD suspicion underwent extensive clinical and genetic assessments by whole-exome sequencing (WES), as well as ultrastructural analysis of cilia by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to identify their genetic etiology. These analyses confirmed the diagnostic of Kartagener syndrome (KS) (PCD with situs inversus). Patient-1 showed a predominance of the absence of the inner dynein arms with two disease-causing variants in the CCDC40 gene. Patient-2 showed the absence of both dynein arms and WES disclosed two novel high impact variants in the DNAH5 gene and two missense variants in the DNAH7 gene, all possibly deleterious. Moreover, in Patient-2, functional data revealed a reduction of gene expression and protein mislocalization in both genes' products. Our work calls the researcher's attention to the complexity of the PCD and to the possibility of gene interactions modelling the PCD phenotype. Further, it is demonstrated that even for well-known PCD genes, novel pathogenic variants could have importance for a PCD/KS diagnosis, reinforcing the difficulty of providing genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis to families.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31468736	Caregiver burden in children with cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia	Caregiver burden impacts both the social and economic framework of society. Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes significant caregiver burden, but the current data is scarce. In the case of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), even less is known. This study aims to compare the caregiver burden of the parents of patients with CF and PCD. Patients with CF and PCD between the ages of 6 to 13 and their parents were included. Patients' clinical information and parents' demographics were recorded. Caregiver burden was measured with Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCB), while the quality of life (QOL) was measured with CFQOL-revised (CFQOL-R) and PCD QOL questionnaire as the patients' age and diagnosis indicated. A total of 63 patients, 44 with CF (69%) and 85 caregivers (35 mothers, 6 fathers, and 22 mother-father dyads) participated in the study. Caregiver burden was significantly higher in mothers of the CF group with a mean ZCB of 30.5 ± 10.7 when compared to the PCD group with a mean ZCB of 21.93 ± 8.26 (P = .006). This was similar in fathers with mean ZCB of 27.5 ± 9.21 in the CF group and 20.36 ± 7.43 in the PCD group (P = .03). In correlation analyses, mothers' caregiver burden moderately and inversely correlated with CFQOL-R subscales in the CF population. Caregiver burden is significantly higher in the CF population when compared to PCD. It is correlated with pulmonary functions and QOL in patients with CF.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.2.

Even though PCD is widely studied, North-African patients have been rarely explored. In this study, we aim at confirming the clinical diagnosis and explore the genetic spectrum of PCD in a cohort of Tunisian patients. Forty clinically diagnosed patients with PCD belonging to 34 families were recruited from Tunisian pediatric departments. In each proband, targeted capture PCD panel sequencing of the 40 PCD genes was performed. PCD panel sequencing identified bi-allelic mutations in 82% of the families in eight PCD genes. Remarkably, 23.5% of patients carried the same c.2190del CCDC39 mutation. Single nucleotide polymorphism profiling in six unrelated patients carrying this mutation has revealed a founder effect in North-African patients. This mutation is estimated to date back at least 1,400-1,750 years ago. The identification of this major allele allowed us to suggest a cost-effective genetic diagnostic strategy in North-African patients with PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

The identification of this major allele allowed us to suggest a cost-effective genetic diagnostic strategy in North-African patients with PCD.
31475479	Validation of pediatric health-related quality of life instruments for primary ciliary dyskinesia (QOL-PCD)	Having developed the first disease-specific, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), we aimed to assess the psychometric performance of quality of life (QOL)-PCD child, adolescent, and parent-proxy versions in terms of reliability and validity across cross-cultural settings and caring for patients with this rare disease. Children (n = 71), adolescents (n = 85), and parents (n = 68) from multiple centers in the UK and North America completed age-appropriate QOL-PCD and generic QOL measures: pediatric QOL inventory, COPD assessment test (CAT), and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20. Total of 13 children, 13 parents, and 17 adolescents repeated QOL-PCD 10 to 14 days later to assess test-retest reliability. Multitrait analysis evaluated how the items loaded to hypothesized scales: physical, emotional & social functioning, treatment burden, role, vitality, upper and lower respiratory symptoms, and ears and hearing symptoms. Examination of item-to-total correlations led to removal of three, five, and six items, respectively in the prototype child, adolescent and parent-proxy versions; the validated measures now comprise between 34 and 38 items. The QOL-PCD scales had good internal consistency; Cronbach's α for QOL-PCD parent-proxy ranged 0.62 to 0.86. Test-retest reliability demonstrated stability across all scales; for example QOL-PCD adolescent intraclass correlation coefficients ranged 0.71 to 0.89. Significant relationships were found between QOL-PCD scales and similar constructs on generic questionnaires, for example, QOL-PCD adolescent lower respiratory symptoms and the CAT score (r = .64, P < .01); weaker correlations were found between different constructs. Age-specific QOL-PCD demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity. QOL-PCD offers promising outcome measures for multicenter clinical trials, as well as monitoring symptoms, functioning, and QOL during routine care.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.2.

31479451	NME5 frameshift variant in Alaskan Malamutes with primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary defect of motile cilia in humans and several domestic animal species. Typical clinical findings are chronic recurrent infections of the respiratory tract and fertility problems. We analyzed an Alaskan Malamute family, in which two out of six puppies were affected by PCD. The parents were unaffected suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Linkage and homozygosity mapping defined critical intervals comprising ~118 Mb. Whole genome sequencing of one case and comparison to 601 control genomes identified a disease associated frameshift variant, c.43delA, in the NME5 gene encoding a sparsely characterized protein associated with ciliary function. Nme5-/- knockout mice exhibit doming of the skull, hydrocephalus and sperm flagellar defects. The genotypes at NME5:c.43delA showed the expected co-segregation with the phenotype in the Alaskan Malamute family. An additional unrelated Alaskan Malamute with PCD and hydrocephalus that became available later in the study was also homozygous mutant at the NME5:c.43delA variant. The mutant allele was not present in more than 1000 control dogs from different breeds. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated absence of the NME5 protein from nasal epithelia of an affected dog. We therefore propose NME5:c.43delA as the most likely candidate causative variant for PCD in Alaskan Malamutes. These findings enable genetic testing to avoid the unintentional breeding of affected dogs in the future. Furthermore, the results of this study identify NME5 as a novel candidate gene for unsolved human PCD and/or hydrocephalus cases.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3. NON IN-VIVO HUMAN MODEL SYSTEM	2.1.

31545650	SPEF2-  and HYDIN -Mutant Cilia Lack the Central Pair-associated Protein SPEF2, Aiding Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Diagnostics	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous chronic destructive airway disease. PCD is traditionally diagnosed by nasal nitric oxide measurement, analysis of ciliary beating, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and/or genetic testing. In most genetic PCD variants, laterality defects can occur. However, it is difficult to establish a diagnosis in individuals with PCD and central pair (CP) defects, and alternative strategies are required because of very subtle ciliary beating abnormalities, a normal ciliary ultrastructure, and normal situs composition. Mutations in HYDIN are known to cause CP defects, but the genetic analysis of HYDIN variants is confounded by the pseudogene HYDIN2, which is almost identical in terms of intron/exon structure. We have previously shown that several types of PCD can be diagnosed via immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy analyses. Here, using IF microscopy, we demonstrated that in individuals with PCD and CP defects, the CP-associated protein SPEF2 is absent in HYDIN-mutant cells, revealing its dependence on functional HYDIN. Next, we performed IF analyses of SPEF2 in respiratory cells from 189 individuals with suspected PCD and situs solitus. Forty-one of the 189 individuals had undetectable SPEF2 and were subjected to a genetic analysis, which revealed one novel loss-of-function mutation in SPEF2 and three reported and 13 novel HYDIN mutations in 15 individuals. The remaining 25 individuals are good candidates for new, as-yet uncharacterized PCD variants that affect the CP apparatus. SPEF2 mutations have been associated with male infertility but have not previously been identified to cause PCD. We identified a mutation of SPEF2 that is causative for PCD with a CP defect. We conclude that SPEF2 IF analyses can facilitate the detection of CP defects and evaluation of the pathogenicity of HYDIN variants, thus aiding the molecular diagnosis of CP defects.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31610925	Frequency of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Variants in Individuals Evaluated for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	To evaluate whether cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants are more common among individuals tested for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) compared with controls. Data were studied from 1021 individuals with commercial genetic testing for suspected PCD and 91 777 controls with genetic testing at the same company (Invitae) for symptoms/diseases unrelated to PCD or CFTR testing. The prevalence of CFTR variants was compared between controls and each of 3 groups of individuals tested for PCD (PCD-positive, -uncertain, and -negative molecular diagnosis). The prevalence of 1 pathogenic CFTR variant was similar among the individual groups. When combining the PCD-uncertain and PCR-negative molecular diagnosis groups, there was a higher prevalence of single pathogenic CFTR variants compared with controls (P = .03). Importantly, >1% of individuals who had negative genetic testing results for PCD had 2 pathogenic CFTR variants (8 of 723), and the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) (2 pathogenic variants) is roughly 1 in 3000 individuals of Caucasian ethnicity (∼0.03%). This incidence was also greater than that of 2 pathogenic CFTR variants in the control population (0.09% [84 of 91 777]; P = 9.60 × 10-16). These variants correlate with mild CFTR-related disease. Our results suggest that a single pathogenic CFTR variant is not likely to be a PCD-mimetic, but ongoing studies are needed in individuals in whom PCD is suspected and genetic testing results are uncertain or negative. Furthermore, CF may be misdiagnosed as PCD, reflecting phenotypic overlap. Among individuals evaluated for PCD, CF should be considered in the differential even in the CF newborn screening era.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

31650533	Clinical and genetic spectrum in 33 Egyptian families with suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder of motile cilia dysfunction generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Genetic testing is increasingly considered an early step in the PCD diagnostic workflow. We used targeted panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) for genetic screening of 33 Egyptian families with clinically highly suspected PCD. All variants prioritized were Sanger confirmed in the affected individuals and correctly segregated within the family. Targeted NGS yielded a high diagnostic output (70%) with biallelic mutations identified in known PCD genes. Mutations were identified in 13 genes overall, with CCDC40 and CCDC39 the most frequently mutated genes among Egyptian patients. Most identified mutations were predicted null effect variants (79%) and not reported before (85%). This study reveals that the genetic landscape of PCD among Egyptians is highly heterogeneous, indicating that a targeted NGS approach covering multiple genes will provide a superior diagnostic yield compared to Sanger sequencing for genetic diagnosis. The high diagnostic output achieved here highlights the potential of placing genetic testing early within the diagnostic workflow for PCD, in particular in developing countries where other diagnostic tests can be less available.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.5.

31696788	Investigation on Ciliary Functionality of Different Airway Epithelial Cell Lines in Three-Dimensional Cell Culture	Three-dimensional respiratory tissue models have been generated using, for example, human primary airway epithelial cells (hAEC) or respective cell lines. To investigate ciliopathies, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, the presence of functional kinocilia in vitro is an essential prerequisite. Since access to hAEC of healthy donors is limited, we aimed to identify a respiratory epithelial cell line that is capable to display functional kinocilia on at least 60% of the apical surface. Thus, we cultured four different human respiratory cell lines with human primary airway fibroblasts under airlift conditions, characterized the morphology, and analyzed ciliary function. Only one of the tested cell lines showed beating kinocilia; however, <10% of the whole surface was covered and ciliary beating was undirected. Positive control tissue models using hAEC and fibroblasts displayed expected directed ciliary beating pattern around 11 Hz. Our data show that the available cell lines are not suitable for basic and applied research questions whenever functional kinocilia are required and that, rather, hAEC- or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived tissue models need to be generated. Impact Statement To study ciliopathies or Bordetella pertussis infection in vitro, three-dimensional respiratory tissue models with functional kinocilia covering at least 60% of the model's surface are mandatory. We cultured four respiratory cell lines on a fibroblast-loaded biological scaffold and showed that none of them met this requirement. In contrast, primary airway cell-derived models sufficiently reflected the mucociliary phenotype. To further search for an alternative to primary respiratory cells, investigations on other cell lines should be conducted or even new cell lines have to be generated.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

31707647	Ciliated Epithelial Cell Differentiation at Air-Liquid Interface Using Commercially Available Culture Media.	The human nasal epithelium contains basal stem/progenitor cells that produce differentiated multiciliated and mucosecretory progeny. Basal epithelial cells can be expanded in cell culture and instructed to differentiate at an air-liquid interface using transwell membranes and differentiation media. For basal cell expansion, we have used 3T3-J2 co-culture in epithelial culture medium containing EGF, insulin, and a RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632 (3T3 + Y). Here we describe our protocols for ciliated differentiation of these cultures at air-liquid interface and compare four commercially available differentiation media, across nine donor cell cultures (six healthy, two patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and one with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)). Bright-field and immunofluorescence imaging suggested broad similarity between differentiation protocols. Subtle differences were seen in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), ciliary beat frequency, mucus production, and the extent to which basal cells are retained in differentiated cultures. Overall, the specific differentiation medium used in our air-liquid interface culture protocol was not a major determinant of ciliation, and our data suggest that the differentiation potential of basal cells at the outset is a more critical factor in air-liquid interface culture outcome. Detailed information on the constituents of the differentiation media was only available from one of the four manufacturers, a factor that may have profound implications in the interpretation of some research studies.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

31711989	Ventilation Inhomogeneity and Bronchial Basement Membrane Changes in Chronic Neutrophilic Airway Inflammation.	Bronchial epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening occurs in diseases with both eosinophilic (allergic bronchial asthma [BA]) and neutrophilic (cystic fibrosis [CF] and primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD]) chronic airway inflammation; however, the lung function and airway remodeling relation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to test whether ventilation inhomogeneity is related to RBM thickening. Multiple breath washout test, endobronchial biopsy, and BAL were performed in 24 children with CF, 11 with PCD, 15 with BA, and in 19 control subjects. Lung clearance index at 2.5% (1/40th) of starting nitrogen concentration (LCI2.5), RBM thickness, and lavage fluid cytology were quantified; their mutual associations were studied by using Spearman rank correlations (r). In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity (mean ± SD) was mild (LCI2.5, 9.3 ± 1.4 vs 7.9 ± 0.9 in control subjects; P = .0391), and the RBM thickened (5.26 ± 0.98 μm vs 3.12 ± 0.62 μm in control subjects; P < .0001). No relation between RBM thickness and ventilation inhomogeneity or lavage cytology was found. In CF and PCD, RBM thickness was similar to that in asthma (4.54 ± 0.66 μm and 5.27 ± 1.11 μm, respectively), but ventilation inhomogeneity was significantly higher (LCI2.5, 12.5 ± 2.4 and 11.8 ± 2.5). Both in CF and PCD, RBM thickness correlated with LCI2.5 (r = 0.594, P = .015; r = 0.821, P = .023). In PCD only, RBM thickness was also related to the number of neutrophils in lavage fluid (r = 0.821; P = .023). Lung function impairment in relation to RBM thickness was milder in BA than in CF and PCD. In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity did not correlate with RBM thickness, whereas it did in CF and PCD. This outcome suggests a different structure-function relation in these diseases.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	0.2.

In CF and PCD, RBM thickness was similar to that in asthma (4.54 ± 0.66 μm and 5.27 ± 1.11 μm, respectively), but ventilation inhomogeneity was significantly higher (LCI2.5, 12.5 ± 2.4 and 11.8 ± 2.5). Both in CF and PCD, RBM thickness correlated with LCI2.5 (r = 0.594, P = .015; r = 0.821, P = .023). In PCD only, RBM thickness was also related to the number of neutrophils in lavage fluid (r = 0.821; P = .023). Lung function impairment in relation to RBM thickness was milder in BA than in CF and PCD. In asthma, ventilation inhomogeneity did not correlate with RBM thickness, whereas it did in CF and PCD. This outcome suggests a different structure-function relation in these diseases.
31772028	Deep phenotyping, including quantitative ciliary beating parameters, and extensive genotyping in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in abnormal ciliary motility/structure, extremely heterogeneous at genetic and ultrastructural levels. We aimed, in light of extensive genotyping, to identify specific and quantitative ciliary beating anomalies, according to the ultrastructural phenotype. We prospectively included 75 patients with PCD exhibiting the main five ultrastructural phenotypes (n=15/group), screened all corresponding PCD genes and measured quantitative beating parameters by high-speed video-microscopy (HSV). Sixty-eight (91%) patients carried biallelic mutations. Combined outer/inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA) defect induces total ciliary immotility, regardless of the gene involved. ODA defect induces a residual beating with dramatically low ciliary beat frequency (CBF) related to increased recovery stroke and pause durations, especially in case of DNAI1 mutations. IDA defect with microtubular disorganisation induces a low percentage of beating cilia with decreased beating angle and, in case of CCDC39 mutations, a relatively conserved mean CBF with a high maximal CBF. Central complex defect induces nearly normal beating parameters, regardless of the gene involved, and a gyrating motion in a minority of ciliated edges, especially in case of RSPH1 mutations. PCD with normal ultrastructure exhibits heterogeneous HSV values, but mostly an increased CBF with an extremely high maximal CBF. Quantitative HSV analysis in PCD objectives beating anomalies associated with specific ciliary ultrastructures and genotypes. It represents a promising approach to guide the molecular analyses towards the best candidate gene(s) to be analysed or to assess the pathogenicity of the numerous sequence variants identified by next-generation-sequencing.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31858719	The outer dynein arm assembly factor CCDC103 forms molecular scaffolds through multiple self-interaction sites	CCDC103 is a small protein with unusual biophysical properties that is required for outer dynein arm assembly on ciliary axonemes. Mutations in both human and zebrafish CCDC103 proteins lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia. Previous studies revealed that this protein can oligomerize and appears to be arrayed along the entire length of the ciliary axoneme. CCDC103 also binds purified microtubules directly and indeed stabilizes them. Here we use biochemical approaches to identify two regions of CCDC103 that mediate self-interaction. In both cases, these associations are stable to heating in the presence of detergent and are not disrupted by strong reducing agents. One interaction region consists of a 27-residue inherently disorder segment that can mediate heat/detergent-resistant dimerization when attached to unrelated monomeric proteins. The second interface includes the C-terminal RPAP3_C alpha helical domain. Our data suggest that CCDC103 can form an unconventional polymer and we propose models for how the monomers might be organized. We also use molecular modeling of the RPAP3_C domain to determine the structural consequences of the pathogenic H154P mutation found in human PCD patients.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31863646	Identification of Potential Therapeutic Gene Markers in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Based on Bioinformatics Analysis	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer found in the nasopharynx with high metastatic and invasive nature. Increasing evidences have identified the critical role of gene therapy in NPC treatment. Hence, this study was designed to identify specific gene markers that affected NPC progression through gene expression profile analysis. NPC-related gene expression data set gene set enrichment (GSE)53819 were retrieved and analyzed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by determination of their expression in noncancerous tissues and NPC specimens. Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted on DEGs to obtain tumor-associated gene modules. Genes in those modules were intersected with DEGs for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Then protein-protein interaction network of tumor-associated genes was constructed to select genes most closely linked to NPC. Afterward, expression of chromosome 9 open reading frame 24 (c9orf24), primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (PCDP1), and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 46 (LRRC46) was detected in GSE53819 and further verified in GSE12452 and GSE64634. Differential analysis on GSE53819 found that 2,173 genes were aberrantly expressed in NPC, among which 917 genes are upregulated and 1,256 genes are downregulated. WGCNA showed that genes were enriched in 17 modules and 727 genes exhibited ectopic expression in NPC and enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis signaling pathways, among which c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 were poorly expressed in NPC. Therefore, c9orf24, PCDP1, and LRRC46 might serve as prominent diagnostic markers for NPC, which presents new insights for NPC therapy.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

We report an unusual case of dextrocardia with situs inversus in a 59-year-old man, referred for a pelvic ultrasound scan because of symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction and after a fairly normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) value. A diagnosis of enlarged prostate gland with a prominent median lobe and significant residual urine volume was made, which necessitated the examination of the kidneys for hydronephrosis, resulting in the incidental finding of situs inversus. On further investigation, the diagnosis of dextrocardia with situs inversus was made. Physicians should look out for this anomaly primarily because it may be associated with other conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia so appropriate interventions are offered to reduce morbidities and mortality.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	0.2.

31925058	Calaxin is required for cilia-driven determination of vertebrate laterality	Calaxin is a Ca2+-binding dynein-associated protein that regulates flagellar and ciliary movement. In ascidians, calaxin plays essential roles in chemotaxis of sperm. However, nothing has been known for the function of calaxin in vertebrates. Here we show that the mice with a null mutation in Efcab1, which encodes calaxin, display typical phenotypes of primary ciliary dyskinesia, including hydrocephalus, situs inversus, and abnormal motility of trachea cilia and sperm flagella. Strikingly, both males and females are viable and fertile, indicating that calaxin is not essential for fertilization in mice. The 9 + 2 axonemal structures of epithelial multicilia and sperm flagella are normal, but the formation of 9 + 0 nodal cilia is significantly disrupted. Knockout of calaxin in zebrafish also causes situs inversus due to the irregular ciliary beating of Kupffer's vesicle cilia, although the 9 + 2 axonemal structure appears to remain normal.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

31960620	Copy number variation in DRC1 is the major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia in the Japanese population	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by functional impairment of cilia throughout the body. The involvement of copy number variation (CNV) in the development of PCD is largely unknown. We examined 93 Japanese patients with clinically suspected PCD from 84 unrelated families. CNV was examined either by exome sequencing of a PCD gene panel or by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The identified alterations were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Nasal ciliary ultrastructure was examined by electron microscopy. Analysis of CNV by the panel or WES revealed a biallelic deletion in the dynein regulatory complex subunit 1 (DRC1) gene in 21 patients, which accounted for 49% of the PCD patients in whom a disease-causing gene was found. Sanger sequencing of the PCR product revealed a 27,748-bp biallelic deletion including exons 1-4 of DRC1 with identical breakpoints in all 21 patients. The ciliary ultrastructure of the patients with this CNV showed axonemal disorganization and the loss or gain of central microtubules. The deletion of DRC1 is the major cause of PCD in Japan and this alteration can cause various ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.5.

Defects in ODAs and IDAs result in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease characterized by recurrent airway infections and male infertility. PCD mutations in assembly factors have been shown to cause a combined ODA-IDA defect, affecting both cilia and flagella. We identified four loss-of-function mutations in TTC12, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein, in four independent families in which affected individuals displayed a peculiar PCD phenotype characterized by the absence of ODAs and IDAs in sperm flagella, contrasting with the absence of only IDAs in respiratory cilia. Analyses of both primary cells from individuals carrying TTC12 mutations and human differentiated airway cells invalidated for TTC12 by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed an IDA defect restricted to a subset of single-headed IDAs that are different in flagella and cilia, whereas TTC12 depletion in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia recapitulated the sperm phenotype. Overall, our study, which identifies TTC12 as a gene involved in PCD, unveils distinct dynein assembly mechanisms in human motile cilia versus flagella.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

Situs status and comorbidities were independently confirmed by two physicians, based on review of radiologic, ultrasonic examination, operative records, and case notes. A total of 155 children (median age: 1.24 years; range: 1 day-17.8 years) confirmed to have SIT were recruited between January 2008 and December 2018. Associated conditions were diagnosed in 114 children (73.5%). Among them, 25 children (16.1%) had multiple anomalies affecting two or more organ systems. The most commonly associated conditions were congenital heart defects (n = 72, 46.5%) followed by primary ciliary dyskinesia (n = 19, 12.3%), renal disorders (n = 12, 7.7%), biliary atresia (n = 7, 4.5%), skeletal dysplasia (n = 8, 5.2%), and mental retardation (n = 4, 2.6%).

32111882	The genetics of situs inversus without primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Situs inversus (SI), a left-right mirror reversal of the visceral organs, can occur with recessive Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). However, most people with SI do not have PCD, and the etiology of their condition remains poorly studied. We sequenced the genomes of 15 people with SI, of which six had PCD, as well as 15 controls. Subjects with non-PCD SI in this sample had an elevated rate of left-handedness (five out of nine), which suggested possible developmental mechanisms linking brain and body laterality. The six SI subjects with PCD all had likely recessive mutations in genes already known to cause PCD. Two non-PCD SI cases also had recessive mutations in known PCD genes, suggesting reduced penetrance for PCD in some SI cases. One non-PCD SI case had recessive mutations in PKD1L1, and another in CFAP52 (also known as WDR16). Both of these genes have previously been linked to SI without PCD. However, five of the nine non-PCD SI cases, including three of the left-handers in this dataset, had no obvious monogenic basis for their condition.

To investigate the relation between mutations in ciliopathy-related SPAG6 and RSPH3 and male infertility with severe asthenoteratospermia characterized by multiple flagellar malformations and reveal the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes of those primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients. Whole-exome sequencing was applied to identify the pathogenic genes for the five PCD patients. The ICSI outcomes of those patients were compared with eight DNAH1-mutated patients and 215 oligo-asthenospermia (OAT) patients. We identified, for the first time, the compound heterozygous SPAG6 mutations (c.143_145del: p.48_49del, c.585delA: p.Lys196Serfs\*6) in a sporadic PCD patient. Further, a novel homozygous nonsynonymous RSPH3 mutation (c.C799T: p.Arg267Cys) was identified in another PCD patient with consanguineous parents. The pathogenicity of these mutations in the assembly of sperm flagella was confirmed by flagellar ultrastructure analysis, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. All five patients underwent six ICSI cycles. The fertilization rate, blastocyst development rate, and clinical pregnancy rate were 69.3%, 50.0%, and 66.7%, respectively. Four of the five couples, including the subjects carrying mutations in SPAG6 or RSPH3, got healthy children born after ICSI.

Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa were performed. The pathogenicity of the variants was validated using patient's spermatozoa and HEK293T cells.

We identified one novel hemizygous frameshift variant (NM_173494, c.319_329del: p.R107fs) of DNAAF6 gene (previously named PIH1D3) in family 1 and one novel hemizygous missense variant (c.290G>T: p.G97V) in family 2. No hemizygous deleterious variants in DNAAF6 were detected in the control cohort of 442 individuals. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa showed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagella.

32188167	Understanding Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: Experience From a Mediterranean Diagnostic Reference Centre	Due to the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test, reference centres with experienced personnel and costly procedures are needed for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostics. Diagnostic flowcharts always start with clinical symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this work is to define differential clinical criteria so that only patients clinically compatible with PCD are referred to reference centres. 18 variables from 476 Mediterranean patients with clinically suspicious PCD were collected. After analysing cilia function and ultrastructure, 89 individuals were diagnosed with PCD and 387 had a negative diagnosis. Simple logistic regression analysis, considering PCD as a dependent variable and the others as independent variables, was done. In order to define the variables that best explain PCD, a step-wise logistic regression model was defined. Aiming to classify individuals as PCD or PCD-like patients, based on variables included in the study, a classification and regression tree (CART) was designed. Simple logistic regression analysis shows statistically significant association between age at the beginning of their symptomatology, periodicity, fertility, situs inversus, recurrent otitis, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, chronic productive cough, rhinorrea, rhinusinusitis and recurrent pneumonias, and PCD. The step-wise logistic regression model selected situs inversus, atelectasis, rhinorrea, chronic productive cough, bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonias, and otitis as PCD predictive variables (82% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 0.92 Area Under the Curve (AUC)). A decision tree was designed in order to classify new individuals based on pansinusitis, situs inversus, periodicity, rhinorrea, bronchiectasis, and chronic wet cough.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32188719	A quantitative super-resolution imaging toolbox for diagnosis of motile ciliopathies.	Airway clearance of pathogens and particulates relies on motile cilia. Impaired cilia motility can lead to reduction in lung function, lung transplant, or death in some cases. More than 50 proteins regulating cilia motility are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a heterogeneous, mainly recessive genetic lung disease. Accurate PCD molecular diagnosis is essential for identifying therapeutic targets and for initiating therapies that can stabilize lung function, thereby reducing socioeconomic impact of the disease. To date, PCD diagnosis has mainly relied on nonquantitative methods that have limited sensitivity or require a priori knowledge of the genes involved. Here, we developed a quantitative super-resolution microscopy workflow: (i) to increase sensitivity and throughput, (ii) to detect structural defects in PCD patients' cells, and (iii) to quantify motility defects caused by yet to be found PCD genes. Toward these goals, we built a localization map of PCD proteins by three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy and implemented quantitative image analysis and machine learning to detect protein mislocalization, we analyzed axonemal structure by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, and we developed a high-throughput method for detecting motile cilia uncoordination by rotational polarity. Together, our data show that super-resolution methods are powerful tools for improving diagnosis of motile ciliopathies.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.5. COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY + INFORMATICS	1.1.

32235794	Knowledge of Rare Respiratory Diseases among Paediatricians and Medical School Students	Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are underdiagnosed rare diseases showing a median diagnostic delay of five to ten years, which has negative effects on patient prognosis. Lack of awareness and education among healthcare professionals involved in the management of these patients have been suggested as possible causes. Our aim was to assess knowledge of these diseases among paediatricians and medical school students to determine which knowledge areas are most deficient. A survey was designed with questions testing fundamental aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of AATD and PCD. A score equal to or greater than 50% of the maximum score was set as the level necessary to ensure a good knowledge of both diseases. Our results indicate a profound lack of knowledge of rare respiratory diseases among paediatric professionals and medical students, suggesting that it is necessary to increase rare respiratory diseases training among all physicians responsible for suspecting and diagnosing them; this will allow early diagnosis and the setup of preventive measures and appropriate early-stage treatment. The first step in closing this knowledge gap could be to include relevant material in the medical syllabus.	primary ciliary dyskinesia			215	Knowledge of Rare Respiratory Diseases among Paediatricians and Medical School Students.

32253119	Implementation of a Gene Panel for Genetic Diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by an alteration in the ciliary structure causing difficulty in the clearance of respiratory secretions. Diagnosis is complex and based on a combination of techniques. The objective of this study was to design a gene panel including all known causative genes, and to corroborate their diagnostic utility in a cohort of Spanish patients. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of patients with a high suspicion of PCD, according to European Respiratory Society criteria, designed around a gene panel for massive sequencing using SeqCap EZ capture technology that included 44 genes associated with PCD. We included 79 patients, 53 of whom had a diagnosis of confirmed or highly probable PCD. The sensitivity of the gene panel was 81.1%, with a specificity of 100%. Candidate variants were found in some of the genes of the panel in 43 patients with PCD, 51.2% (22/43) of whom were homozygotes and 48.8% (21/43) compound heterozygotes. The most common causative genes were DNAH5 and CCDC39. We found 52 different variants, 36 of which were not previously described in the literature. The design and implementation of a tailored gene panel produces a high yield in the genetic diagnosis of PCD. This panel provides a better understanding of the causative factors involved in these patients and lays down the groundwork for future therapeutic approaches.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

32284045	Exacerbations and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization are associated with altered lung structure and function in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract are one of the major clinical features of the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disease due to malfunctioning of motile cilia. Chronic infections and persistent inflammation of the respiratory system result in progressive lung disease. Aim of the study was to highlight the main factors associated with clinical, functional and anatomical deterioration in PCD patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 58 patients with PCD, 37 adults and 21 children. The demographic and clinical data, forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), sputum microbiology and imaging results (chest CT scores-modified Bhalla) were recorded. Patients were stratified according to the number of exacerbations (< 2/year vs ≥ 2/year) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization. The possible correlations between lung function and chest CT scores were assessed; we also evaluated the correlation between these parameters and the severity scores for bronchiectasis (BSI, FACED and e-FACED). Chest CT scores showed a significant correlation with FEV1 (p = 0.0002), age (p <  0.0001), BMI (p = 0.0002) and number of lung lobes involved (p <  0.0001). PA colonization had an overall prevalence of 32.6%: no significant difference in FEV1 between PA colonized and non-colonized patients was found (p = 0.70), while chest CT score was significantly worse in chronic PA colonized patients (p = 0.009). Patients with a high number of exacerbation (≥ 2/year) were older (p = 0.01), had lower FEV1 (p = 0.03), greater number of lobes involved (p < 0.001) and worse CT score than patients with low number of exacerbations (p = 0.001); they also had higher prevalence of PA chronic bronchial infection (33.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.10). Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for gender, age and BMI showed positive associations between PA colonization and number of exacerbations with severity of disease (number of lobes involved, CT score, BSI, FACED, and e-FACED). In our PCD population the number of exacerbations (≥ 2/year) and PA colonization were the two most relevant factors associated with severity of disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

Computed tomography revealed an endobronchial massive shadow at the ostial site of the right upper lobe bronchus with atelectasis of the right upper lobe. The mass was surgically resected and pathologically diagnosed as mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The lesion had no vascular invasions and no metastases to the lungs or lymph nodes. The surgical margin was negative for carcinoma. Following surgery, the patient has been in good condition. The present case showed different clinicopathological characteristics from those previously reported in cases of Kartagener syndrome complicated by carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a young, non-smoking female with comorbid Kartagener syndrome and pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

32380069	Efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia (BESTCILIA): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial	Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD. The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</≥ 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0·75 (SD 1·12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1·62 (1·64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·26-0·78]; p=0·004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

The abnormal ciliary structure and function lead to variable clinical manifestations, including dextrocardia, pneumonia, bronchitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, reduced fertility in women, and infertility in men. This article reports our experience on general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in a patient with KS. A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with chronic nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, chronic sinusitis, and chronic non-productive cough for FESS. The patient's heart was on the right side of his chest. A chest roentgenogram and a high﻿-resolution chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan identified dextrocardia, situs inversus, and chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis involving both lung bases. CT sinuses showed mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary and ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The patient was prescribed oral medications and nasal spray for crepitations and wheezes heard over bilateral lung fields. Intensive chest physiotherapy and supportive care prior to surgery were provided to prevent worsening of lung function. FESS with bilateral frontal polypectomy was performed. All hemodynamic parameters were stable. The emergence from anesthesia was smooth. After ~20 minutes in the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was fully awake and pain-free. He was then transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and subsequently to the ward. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient felt subjectively ""very well"" and was discharged from the hospital on the 2nd postoperative day.

32482850	CAMSAP3 facilitates basal body polarity and the formation of the central pair of microtubules in motile cilia	"Synchronized beating of cilia on multiciliated cells (MCCs) generates a directional flow of mucus across epithelia. This motility requires a ""9 + 2"" microtubule (MT) configuration in axonemes and the unidirectional array of basal bodies of cilia on the MCCs. However, it is not fully understood what components are needed for central MT-pair assembly as they are not continuous with basal bodies in contrast to the nine outer MT doublets. In this study, we discovered that a homozygous knockdown mouse model for MT minus-end regulator calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3), Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , exhibited multiple phenotypes, some of which are typical of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition caused by motile cilia defects. Anatomical examination of Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  mice revealed severe nasal airway blockage and abnormal ciliary morphologies in nasal MCCs. MCCs from different tissues exhibited defective synchronized beating and ineffective generation of directional flow likely underlying the PCD-like phenotypes. In normal mice, CAMSAP3 localized to the base of axonemes and at the basal bodies in MCCs. However, in Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a  , MCCs lacked CAMSAP3 at the ciliary base. Importantly, the central MT pairs were missing in the majority of cilia, and the polarity of the basal bodies was disorganized. These phenotypes were further confirmed in MCCs of Xenopus embryos when CAMSAP3 expression was knocked down by morpholino injection.

One hundred four children with non-CF bronchiectasis followed between 2002 and 2019 were enrolled. Age of diagnosis, underlying etiology and microorganisms in sputum culture were recorded. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in terms of lung function tests and annual pulmonary exacerbation rates at presentation and within the last 12 months. Mean FEV1 and FVC %predicted at presentation improved compared to historical cohort (76.6 ± 17.1 vs. 63.3 ± 22.1 and 76.6 ± 15.1 vs. 67.3 ± 23.1, respectively; p <  0.001). There was a significant decrease in pulmonary exacerbation rate from 6.05 ± 2.88 at presentation to 3.23 ± 2.08 during follow-up (p <  0.0001). In 80.8% of patients, an underlying etiology was identified. There was an increase in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (32.7% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.001), decrease in idiopathic cases (19.2% vs. 37.8%; p = 0.03) with no change in postinfectious and immunodeficiencies as underlying etiology. Sputum cultures were positive in 77.9% of patients which was 46.9% in the historical cohort (p = 0.001). Baseline pulmonary function tests were better and distribution of underlying etiology had changed with a remarkable increase in diagnosis of PCD in the recent cohort.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32551925	Sinus Development and Pneumatization in a Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Cohort	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically diverse disease which causes impaired mucociliary clearance, and results in pulmonary, otologic, and rhinologic disease in affected patients. Genetic mutations in multiple genes impair the ability of patients to clear mucous from the lungs, middle ear, and sinonasal cavity and lead to chronic pulmonary and sinonasal symptoms. We identified 17 PCD patients who had available CT scans. Volumes for bilateral maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses were calculated. A control population of patients who had preoperative CT scans for endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base pathology without sinonasal cavity involvement was also identified. The mean age of PCD was 33 and ranged from 13 to 54 years. Patients were age- and gender-matched to a control group that underwent resection of anterior skull-base tumors and had a mean age of 35 that ranged between 17-53 years old. The volumes for all thee sinus cavities were significantly smaller (p < 0.007) compared to the control population. The average Lund-Mackay score was 10.6 in the PCD cohort (range 6-16) in comparison to an average of 0.7 in the control cohort (range 0-2). Overall sinus volumes were smaller in patients with PCD compared to our control population. Future studies will be aimed at understanding defects in sinus development as a function of specific genetic mutations in PCD patients. Ultimately, a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of PCD will allow us to identify the optimal treatment practices for this unique patient group.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32560490	Dental Anomalies in Rare, Genetic Ciliopathic Disorder-A Case Report and Review of Literature	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, ciliopathic disorder. In many ciliopathies, dental anomalies are observed alongside other symptoms of the disease. To date, there are no published reports concerning the dental developmental problems that are associated with ciliary defects in PCD patients. Patients suffering from PCD underwent dental clinical examination, which included the assessment of developmental disorders regarding the number and morphological structure of the teeth (size and shape) as well as developmental disorders of mineralised dental tissues. Then, three-dimensional radiographic examination was performed utilising Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Four PCD patients, aged 31-54, agreed to enter the study. Dental examinations showed the presence of dental developmental disorders in three of them. Additionally, CBCT showed abnormalities in those patients. 1. The dental phenotype in PCD patients seems to be heterogeneous. Tooth developmental disorders resulting from abnormal odontogenesis may be a symptom of PCD that is concomitant with other developmental abnormalities resulting from malfunctioning primary cilia. 2. Patients with ciliopathies are likely to develop dental developmental defects. Therefore, beginning in early childhood, they should be included in a targeted specialised dental programme to enable early diagnosis and to ensure dedicated preventive and therapeutic measures.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32603187	Comparison of Multiple Breath Washout and Spirometry in Children with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia and Cystic Fibrosis and Healthy Controls	Rationale: In cystic fibrosis (CF), the lung clearance index (LCI), derived from multiple breath washout (MBW), is more sensitive in detecting early lung disease than FEV1; MBW has been less thoroughly evaluated in young patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).Objectives: Our objectives were 1) to evaluate the sensitivity of MBW and spirometry for the detection of mild lung disease in young children with PCD and CF compared with healthy control (HC) subjects and 2) to compare patterns of airway obstruction between disease populations.Methods: We used a multicenter, single-visit, observational study in children with PCD and CF with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than 60% predicted and HC subjects, ages 3-12 years. Nitrogen MBW and spirometry were performed and overread for acceptability. χ2 and Kruskall-Wallis tests compared demographics and lung function measures between groups, linear regression evaluated the effect of disease state, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient compared the LCI and spirometric measurements.Results: Twenty-five children with PCD, 49 children with CF, and 80 HC children were enrolled, among whom 17 children with PCD (68%), 36 children with CF (73%), and 53 (66%) HC children performed both acceptable spirometry and MBW; these children made up the analytic cohort. The median age was 9.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.8-11.1). The LCI was abnormal (more than 7.8) in 10 of 17 (59%) patients with PCD and 21 of 36 (58%) patients with CF, whereas FEV1 was abnormal in three of 17 (18%) patients with PCD and six of 36 (17%) patients with CF. The LCI was significantly elevated in patients with PCD and CF compared with HC subjects (ratio of geometric mean vs. HC: PCD 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.39; and CF 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33]). Children with PCD had lower midexpiratory-phase forced expiratory flow % predicted compared with children with CF (62% [IQR, 50-78%] vs. 85% [IQR, 68-99%]; P = 0.05). LCI did not correlate with FEV1.Conclusions: The LCI is more sensitive than FEV1 in detecting lung disease in young patients with PCD, similar to CF. LCI holds promise as a sensitive endpoint for the assessment of early PCD lung disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	0.2.

32704025	Genetic interaction between central pair apparatus genes CFAP221, CFAP54, and SPEF2 in mouse models of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome that results from defects in motile cilia. The ciliary axoneme has a 9 + 2 microtubule structure consisting of nine peripheral doublets surrounding a central pair apparatus (CPA), which plays a critical role in regulating proper ciliary function. We have previously shown that mouse models with mutations in CPA genes CFAP221, CFAP54, and SPEF2 have a PCD phenotype with defects in ciliary motility. In this study, we investigated potential genetic interaction between these CPA genes by generating each combination of double heterozygous and double homozygous mutants. No detectable cilia-related phenotypes were observed in double heterozygotes, but all three double homozygous mutant lines exhibit early mortality and typically develop severe PCD-associated phenotypes of hydrocephalus, mucociliary clearance defects in the upper airway, and abnormal spermatogenesis. Double homozygous cilia are generally intact and display a normal morphology and distribution. Spermiogenesis is aborted in double homozygotes, with an absence of mature flagella on elongating spermatids and epididymal sperm. These findings identify genetic interactions between CPA genes and genetic mechanisms regulating the CPA and motile cilia function.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	2.3.

The Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) does not recommend routine lobectomy, reserving its use for ""rare cases of PCD with severe, localized bronchiectasis"" and warns that a lobectomy should be treated with caution. However, if aggressive medical management fails, selective surgical removal of severely defective lung may result in maintenance or improvement of pulmonary function. Certainly, the decision to recommend lung resection in the face of chronic bronchiectasis from PCD requires an extensive discussion before it is considered as an alternative treatment. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate that in selected cases of unilobar disease with bronchiectasis that are not responsive to other therapies (antibiotics and airway clearance), removal of localized necrotic areas of the lung along with prophylactic antibiotics can improve the quality of life of children with PCD associated bronchiectasis and improve growth and nutritional status, and pulmonary function."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.3.

32899853	Late Diagnosis of Infants with PCD and Neonatal Respiratory Distress	Neonatal respiratory distress (NRD) is common among infants with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but we do not know whether affected neonates receive a timely diagnosis. We used data from the international PCD cohort and assessed the proportion of patients with PCD who had a history of NRD and their age at diagnosis, stratifying by presence of laterality defects. First we analyzed data from all participants diagnosed after 2000, followed by individuals from a subgroup diagnosed using stricter criteria. Among the 1375 patients in the study, 45% had a history of NRD and 42% had laterality defects. Out of the 476 children with definite PCD diagnosis, 55% had a history of NRD and 50% had laterality defects. Overall, 30% of children with PCD were diagnosed during the first 12 months of life. This varied from 13% in those with situs solitus and no NRD, to 21% in those with situs solitus and NRD, 33% in those with situs anomalies but no NRD, and 52% in those with both situs anomalies and NRD. Our results suggest that we need to improve our knowledge of the neonatal presentation of infants with PCD and apply it so that these patients will receive appropriate care sooner.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32964004	Airway-artery quantitative assessment on chest computed tomography in paediatric primary ciliary dyskinesia	Chest computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for detecting structural abnormalities in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) such as bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and mucus plugging. There are no studies on quantitative assessment of airway and artery abnormalities in children with PCD. The objectives of the present study were to quantify airway and artery dimensions on chest CT in a cohort of children with PCD and compare these with control children to analyse the influence of covariates on airway and artery dimensions. Chest CTs of 13 children with PCD (14 CT scans) and 12 control children were collected retrospectively. The bronchial tree was segmented semi-automatically and reconstructed in a three-dimensional view. All visible airway-artery (AA) pairs were measured perpendicular to the airway centre line, annotating per branch inner and outer airway and adjacent artery diameter and computing inner airway diameter/artery ratio (AinA ratio), outer airway diameter/artery ratio (AoutA ratio), wall thickness (WT), WT/outer airway diameter ratio (Awt ratio) and WT/artery ratio. In the children with PCD (38.5% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 9.8-15.3) 1526 AA pairs were measured versus 1516 in controls (58.3% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 8-14.8). AinA ratio and AoutA ratio were significantly higher in children with PCD than in control children (both p<0.001). Awt ratio was significantly higher in control children than in children with PCD (p<0.001). Our study showed that in children with PCD airways are more dilated than in controls and do not show airway wall thickening.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

There are no studies on quantitative assessment of airway and artery abnormalities in children with PCD. The objectives of the present study were to quantify airway and artery dimensions on chest CT in a cohort of children with PCD and compare these with control children to analyse the influence of covariates on airway and artery dimensions. Chest CTs of 13 children with PCD (14 CT scans) and 12 control children were collected retrospectively. The bronchial tree was segmented semi-automatically and reconstructed in a three-dimensional view. All visible airway-artery (AA) pairs were measured perpendicular to the airway centre line, annotating per branch inner and outer airway and adjacent artery diameter and computing inner airway diameter/artery ratio (AinA ratio), outer airway diameter/artery ratio (AoutA ratio), wall thickness (WT), WT/outer airway diameter ratio (Awt ratio) and WT/artery ratio. In the children with PCD (38.5% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 9.8-15.3) 1526 AA pairs were measured versus 1516 in controls (58.3% male, mean age 13.5 years, range 8-14.8). AinA ratio and AoutA ratio were significantly higher in children with PCD than in control children (both p<0.001). Awt ratio was significantly higher in control children than in children with PCD (p<0.001). Our study showed that in children with PCD airways are more dilated than in controls and do not show airway wall thickening.
32996775	PCD Detect: enhancing ciliary features through image averaging and classification	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder of the motile cilia. Early accurate diagnosis is important to help prevent lung damage in childhood and to preserve lung function. Confirmation of a diagnosis traditionally relied on assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, >50 known PCD genes have made the identification of biallelic mutations a viable alternative to confirm diagnosis. TEM and genotyping lack sensitivity, and research to improve accuracy of both is required. TEM can be challenging when a subtle or partial ciliary defect is present or affected cilia structures are difficult to identify due to poor contrast. Here, we demonstrate software to enhance TEM ciliary images and reduce background by averaging ciliary features. This includes an option to classify features into groups based on their appearance, to generate multiple averages when a nonhomogeneous abnormality is present. We validated this software on images taken from subjects with well-characterized PCD caused by variants in the outer dynein arm (ODA) heavy chain gene DNAH5. Examining more difficult to diagnose cases, we detected 1) regionally restricted absence of the ODAs away from the ciliary base, in a subject carrying mutations in DNAH9; 2) loss of the typically poorly contrasted inner dynein arms; and 3) sporadic absence of part of the central pair complex in subjects carrying mutations in HYDIN, including one case with an unverified genetic diagnosis. We show that this easy-to-use software can assist in detailing relationships between genotype and ultrastructural phenotype, improving diagnosis of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

32997437	Comparison of conventional chest physiotherapy and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Chest physiotherapy (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella®) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance in PCD patients.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.4.

33036612	Functional analysis and evaluation of respiratory cilia in healthy Chinese children	To aid in the diagnosis of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) and to evaluate the respiratory epithelium in respiratory disease, normal age-related reference ranges are needed for ciliary beat frequency (CBF), beat pattern and ultrastructure. Our aim was to establish reference ranges for healthy Chinese children. Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained from 135 healthy Chinese children aged below 18 years by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate. CBF and beat pattern were analysed from high speed video recordings. Epithelial integrity and ciliary ultrastructure were assessed using transmission electronic microscopy. The mean CBF from 135 children studied was 10.1 Hz (95% CI 9.8 to 10.4). Approximately 20% (ranged 18.0-24.2%) of ciliated epithelial edges were found to have areas of dyskinetically beating cilia. Normal beat pattern was observed in ciliated epithelium from all subjects. We did not find any effect of exposure to second hand smoke on CBF in our subjects. Microtubular defects were found in 9.3% of all of the cilia counted in these children, while other ciliary ultrastructural defects were found in less than 3%. We established the reference range for CBF, beat pattern and ultrastructure in healthy Chinese children. Using similar methodology, we found a lower overall mean CBF than previously obtained European values. This study highlights the need to establish normative data for ciliary function in different populations.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.5.

"The derivation of tissue-specific stem cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would have broad reaching implications for regenerative medicine. Here, we report the directed differentiation of human iPSCs into airway basal cells (""iBCs""), a population resembling the stem cell of the airway epithelium. Using a dual fluorescent reporter system (NKX2-1GFP;TP63tdTomato), we track and purify these cells as they first emerge as developmentally immature NKX2-1GFP+ lung progenitors and subsequently augment a TP63 program during proximal airway epithelial patterning. In response to primary basal cell medium, NKX2-1GFP+/TP63tdTomato+ cells display the molecular and functional phenotype of airway basal cells, including the capacity to self-renew or undergo multi-lineage differentiation in vitro and in tracheal xenografts in vivo. iBCs and their differentiated progeny model perturbations that characterize acquired and genetic airway diseases, including the mucus metaplasia of asthma, chloride channel dysfunction of cystic fibrosis, and ciliary defects of primary ciliary dyskinesia."	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.3.

33167880	A novel genetic variant in DNAI2 detected by custom gene panel in a newborn with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: case report	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disorder caused by defects in motile cilia. The hallmark features of PCD are the chronic infections of the respiratory tract, moreover, clinical manifestations include also laterality defects and risk of male infertility. Clinical phenotypes of PCD are the result of mutations in genes encoding components of axonema or factors involved in axonemal assembly. Recent studies have identified over 45 PCD-associated genes, therefore, molecular analysis represents a powerful diagnostic tool to confirm and uncover new genetic causes of this rare disease. Here, we describe a female infant of Moroccan origin with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in addition to most common PCD symptoms. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular tests, such as a Next generation Sequencing panel and a custom array CGH, were performed for diagnosis of PCD. TEM revealed outer dynein arm (ODA) defects, whilst molecular analyses detected a novel 6,9 kb microdeletion in DNAI2 gene. Since DNAI2 mutations are very rare, this case report contributes to better delineate the important role of DNAI2 as causative of PCD phenotype, suggesting, furthermore, that the variations in DNAI2 may be as a new genetic risk factor for NPH. Indeed, although the association of hydrocephalus with PCD has been well documented, however, only a small number of human patients show this defect. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of high-throughput technologies in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous genetic disorders.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

33226018	Nasal Brushing Sampling and Processing using Digital High Speed Ciliary Videomicroscopy - Adaptation for the COVID-19 Pandemic	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic motile ciliopathy, leading to significant otosinopulmonary disease. PCD diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to challenges with different diagnostic modalities. Ciliary videomicroscopy, using Digital High-Speed Videomicroscopy (DHSV), one of the diagnostic tools for PCD, is considered the optimal method to perform ciliary functional analysis (CFA), comprising of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and beat pattern (CBP) analysis. However, DHSV lacks standardized, published operating procedure for processing and analyzing samples. It also uses living respiratory epithelium, a significant infection control issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. To continue providing a diagnostic service during this health crisis, the ciliary videomicroscopy protocol has been adapted to include adequate infection control measures. Here, we describe a revised protocol for sampling and laboratory processing of ciliated respiratory samples, highlighting adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control measures. Representative results of CFA from nasal brushing samples obtained from 16 healthy subjects, processed and analyzed according to this protocol, are described. We also illustrate the importance of obtaining and processing optimal quality epithelial ciliated strips, as samples not meeting quality selection criteria do now allow for CFA, potentially decreasing the diagnostic reliability and the efficiency of this technique.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

33233428	A Revised Protocol for Culture of Airway Epithelial Cells as a Diagnostic Tool for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of nasal epithelial cells is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and research of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Ex vivo samples often display secondary dyskinesia from cell damage during sampling, infection or inflammation confounding PCD diagnostic results. ALI culture enables regeneration of healthy cilia facilitating differentiation of primary from secondary ciliary dyskinesia. We describe a revised ALI culture method adopted from April 2018 across three collaborating PCD diagnostic sites, including current University Hospital Southampton COVID-19 risk mitigation measures, and present results. Two hundred and forty nasal epithelial cell samples were seeded for ALI culture and 199 (82.9%) were ciliated. Fifty-four of 83 (63.9%) ex vivo samples which were originally equivocal or insufficient provided diagnostic information following in vitro culture. Surplus basal epithelial cells from 181 nasal brushing samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen; 39 samples were ALI-cultured after cryostorage and all ciliated. The ciliary beat patterns of ex vivo samples (by high-speed video microscopy) were recapitulated, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated excellent ciliation, and cilia could be immuno-fluorescently labelled (anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-RSPH4a) in representative cases that were ALI-cultured after cryostorage. In summary, our ALI culture protocol provides high ciliation rates across three centres, minimising patient recall for repeat brushing biopsies and improving diagnostic certainty. Cryostorage of surplus diagnostic samples was successful, facilitating PCD research.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

33250217	Robotic lobectomy in children with severe bronchiectasis: A worthwhile new technology	Lobectomy is required in children affected by non-responsive, symptomatic, localized bronchiectasis, but inflammation makes thoracoscopy challenging. We present the first published series of robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy in children with bronchiectasis. Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for severe localized bronchiectasis (2014-2019) via thoracoscopic versus robotic lobectomy. Four 5 mm ports were used for thoracoscopy; a four-arm approach was used for robotic surgery (Da Vinci Surgical Xi System, Intuitive Surgical, California). Eighteen children were operated (robotic resection, n = 7; thoracoscopy, n = 11) with infected congenital pulmonary malformation, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and post-viral infection. There were no conversions to open surgery with robotic surgery, but five with thoracoscopy. Total operative time was significantly longer with robotic versus thoracoscopic surgery (mean 247 ± 50 versus 152 ± 57 min, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, length of thoracic drainage, or total length of stay (mean 7 ± 2 versus 8 ± 3 days, respectively). No blood transfusions were required. Two thoracoscopic patients had a type-3 postoperative complication. Pediatric robotic lung lobectomy is feasible and safe, with excellent visualization and bi-manual hand-wrist dissection - useful properties in difficult cases of infectious pathologies. However, instrumentation dimensions limit use in smaller thoraxes.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	3.4.

33279757	Primary ciliary dyskinesia relative protein ZMYND10 is involved in regulating ciliary function and intraflagellar transport in Paramecium tetraurelia.	Cilia are highly conserved in most eukaryotes and are regarded as an important organelle for motility and sensation in various species. Cilia are microscopic, hair-like cytoskeletal structures that protrude from the cell surface. The major focus in studies of cilia has been concentrated on the ciliary dysfunction in vertebrates that causes multisymptomatic diseases, which together are referred to as ciliopathies. To date, the understanding of ciliopathies has largely depended on the study of ciliary structure and function in different animal models. Zinc finger MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10) is a ciliary protein that was recently found to be mutated in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In Paramecium tetraurelia, we identified two ZMYND10 genes, arising from a whole-genome duplication. Using RNAi, we found that the depletion of ZMYND10 in P. tetraurelia causes severe ciliary defects, thus provoking swimming dysfunction and lethality. Moreover, we found that the absence of ZMYND10 caused the abnormal localization of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT43 along cilia. These results suggest that ZMYND10 is involved in the regulation of ciliary function and IFT, which may contribute to the study of PCD pathogenesis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

33447612	Whole-exome sequencing accuracy in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	The diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) relies on clinical features and sophisticated studies. The detection of bi-allelic disease-causing variants confirms the diagnosis. However, a standardised genetic panel is not widely available and new disease-causing genes are continuously identified. To assess the accuracy of untargeted whole-exome sequencing (WES) as a diagnostic tool for PCD, patients with symptoms highly suggestive of PCD were consecutively included. Patients underwent measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels, ciliary transmission electron microscopy analysis (TEM) and WES. A confirmed PCD diagnosis in symptomatic patients was defined as a recognised ciliary ultrastructural defect on TEM and/or two pathogenic variants in a known PCD-causing gene. Forty-eight patients (46% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 10.0 years (range 1.0-37 years). In 36 patients (75%) a diagnosis of PCD was confirmed, of which 14 (39%) patients had normal TEM. A standalone untargeted WES had a diagnostic yield of 94%, identifying bi-allelic variants in 11 known PCD-causing genes in 34 subjects. A nNO<77 nL·min was nonspecific when including patients younger than 5 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.90). Consecutive WES considerably improved the diagnostic accuracy of nNO in young children (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1). Finally, WES established an alternative diagnosis in four patients. In patients with clinically suspected PCD and low nNO levels, WES is a simple, beneficial and accurate next step to confirm the diagnosis of PCD or suggest an alternative diagnosis, especially in preschool-aged children in whom nNO is less specific.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

A nNO<77 nL·min was nonspecific when including patients younger than 5 years (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.90). Consecutive WES considerably improved the diagnostic accuracy of nNO in young children (AUC 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1). Finally, WES established an alternative diagnosis in four patients. In patients with clinically suspected PCD and low nNO levels, WES is a simple, beneficial and accurate next step to confirm the diagnosis of PCD or suggest an alternative diagnosis, especially in preschool-aged children in whom nNO is less specific.

33589394	Multifaceted analysis of Japanese cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia: Value of immunofluorescence for ciliary protein detection in patients with DNAH5 and DNAH11 mutations.	Multifaceted analysis is recommended for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A 31-year-old woman had situs inversus, bronchiectasis, family history of PCD, and compound heterozygous mutations in DNAH5. Her cilia were immotile. Defects in the outer dynein arms were revealed by transmission electron microscopy and loss of DNAH5 proteins in the entire length of axonemes using immunofluorescence (IF). A 17-year-old boy had bronchiectasis and heterozygous mutations in DNAH11. His cilia were motile with normal ultrastructure. The loss of DNAH11 proteins at the proximal region of cilia was revealed by IF. IF could be useful to support PCD diagnosis.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

33608380	Transcript analysis for variant classification resolution in a child with primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Transcriptional analysis can be utilized to reconcile variants of uncertain significance, particularly those predicted to impact splicing. Laboratory analysis of the predicted mRNA transcript may allow inference of the in vivo impact of the variant and aid prediction of its clinical significance. We present a patient with classical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) who was identified to have compound heterozygous variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.10691 + 2T > C, c.13523_13543dup21) via trio whole-exome sequencing in 2013. These variants were originally classified as Mutation and Likely Mutation. However, these variants were downgraded to variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) during reanalysis in 2016 because of uncertainty that they caused a loss of function of the gene. c.10691 + 2T > C is predicted to abrogate the canonical splice site and lead to the skipping of exon 65, but the adjoining of exon 64 and exon 66 in the DNAH11 transcript preserves the reading frame of the resultant protein. c.13523_13543dup21 is located in the last exon of the DNAH11 coding sequence, upstream of the canonical stop codon, which suggests a reduced likelihood to trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Transcriptional analysis was performed to characterize the impact of the variants, resulting in reclassification of c.10691 + 2T > C to Likely Pathogenic by providing evidence that it results in a deleterious effect and subsequent downstream reclassification of c.13523\_13543dup21 to Likely Pathogenic as well. Our case illustrates the potential impact of transcriptional analysis on variant resolution, supporting its usage on variants that exert an unpredictable effect on splicing.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

33635012	Genetic Analysis of Korean Adult Patients with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Suspected of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Using Whole Exome Sequencing.	Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is ubiquitous in the environment, but NTM lung disease (NTM-LD) is uncommon. Since exposure to NTM is inevitable, patients who develop NTM-LD are likely to have specific susceptibility factors, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia and is characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection, organ laterality defect, and infertility. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and investigated the genetic characteristics of adult NTM patients with suspected PCD. WES was performed in 13 NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD by clinical symptoms and/or ultrastructural ciliary defect observed by transmission electron microscopy. A total of 45 PCD-causing genes, 23 PCD-candidate genes, and 990 ciliome genes were analyzed. Four patients were found to have biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the following PCD-causing genes: CCDC114, DNAH5, HYDIN, and NME5. In four other patients, only one LoF variant was identified, while the remaining five patients did not have any LoF variants. At least 30.8% of NTM-LD patients who were suspected of having PCD had biallelic LoF variants, and an additional 30.8% of patients had one LoF variant. Therefore, PCD should be considered in patients with NTM-LD with symptoms or signs suspicious of PCD.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

33635866	Defects in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms cause morphological abnormalities and dysmotility in sperm cells leading to male infertility.	Axonemal protein complexes, such as outer (ODA) and inner (IDA) dynein arms, are responsible for the generation and regulation of flagellar and ciliary beating. Studies in various ciliated model organisms have shown that axonemal dynein arms are first assembled in the cell cytoplasm and then delivered into axonemes during ciliogenesis. In humans, mutations in genes encoding for factors involved in this process cause structural and functional defects of motile cilia in various organs such as the airways and result in the hereditary disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite extensive knowledge about the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein arms in respiratory cilia, this process is still poorly understood in sperm flagella. To better define its clinical relevance on sperm structure and function, and thus male fertility, further investigations are required. Here we report the fertility status in different axonemal dynein preassembly mutant males (DNAAF2/ KTU, DNAAF4/ DYX1C1, DNAAF6/ PIH1D3, DNAAF7/ZMYND10, CFAP300/C11orf70 and LRRC6). Besides andrological examinations, we functionally and structurally analyzed sperm flagella of affected individuals by high-speed video- and transmission electron microscopy as well as systematically compared the composition of dynein arms in sperm flagella and respiratory cilia by immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, we analyzed the flagellar length in dynein preassembly mutant sperm. We found that the process of axonemal dynein preassembly is also critical in sperm, by identifying defects of ODAs and IDAs in dysmotile sperm of these individuals. Interestingly, these mutant sperm consistently show a complete loss of ODAs, while some respiratory cilia from the same individual can retain ODAs in the proximal ciliary compartment. This agrees with reports of solely one distinct ODA type in sperm, compared to two different ODA types in proximal and distal respiratory ciliary axonemes. Consistent with observations in model organisms, we also determined a significant reduction of sperm flagellar length in these individuals. These findings are relevant to subsequent studies on the function and composition of sperm flagella in PCD patients and non-syndromic infertile males. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the fertility status in PCD-affected males and should help guide genetic and andrological counselling for affected males and their families.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

Crazy-paving patterns are rarely reported as radiological manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Herein, we presented a very rare case of a crazy-paving pattern as a radiological manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia was ultimately confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy, fungus culture, whole exome sequencing of blood, etc. The patient received flucytosine (PO, 5 g per day) and amphotericin B (IV, 70 mg per day) during hospitalization and sequential therapy with voriconazole (PO, 200 mg twice a day) after discharge. He recovered during follow-up. We concluded that pulmonary cryptococcosis should be considered a possible cause of crazy-paving patterns in chest CT scans.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	1.1.

33719352	Case Report: Identification of a Novel ODAD3 Variant in a Patient With Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.	Background:ODAD3 encodes a protein of 595 amino acids and contain three highly conserved coiled-coil domains, which is essential for cilia axoneme dynein arm assembly and docking. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) of ODAD3 deficiency are rarely reported. Female infertility in PCD related to ODAD3 variants has not been reported. Methods: Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the disease-related gene of the patient with PCD in a consanguineous Chinese family. Domain analysis was applied to predict the impact of the variant on ODAD3 protein. Results: The 35 year-old female patient exhibited chronic sinusitis, diffuse bronchiectasis, dextrocardia and infertility. We identified a novel homozygous variant in ODAD3, c.1166\_1169dupAGAC, p.(Leu391Aspfs\*105) in the PCD patient by exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. This frameshift variant was predicted to be disease causing by bioinformatics analysis and was also not presented in the current authorized large genetic databases. Conclusions: Our study enriches the genetic spectrum and clinical phenotypes of ODAD3 variants in PCD and provide more evidence for future genetic counseling and gene-targeted therapy for this disease.	primary ciliary dyskinesia	2.1.

19410311	Two vascular arteriovenous malformations with left-to-right shunting and right-heart failure in a single patient	Arteriovenous malformations may lead to right-heart failure in cases of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female who presented with congestive heart failure related to an isolated anomalous connection of the left pulmonary vein to the left brachiocephalic vein (partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection). After successful reconnection to the left appendage and clinical improvement, the patient once again developed progressive signs of heart failure. Several arteriovenous malformations were identified in the liver as the underlying cause of the patient's high-output heart failure, and the patient was retrospectively diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Target embolization led to right-ventricular remodeling, and persistent clinical improvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two rare AV-malformations with left-to-right shunting and progressive right-heart failure in a single individual.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

20414677	Update on molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disease hallmarked by the development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Germline mutations in two genes, endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ACVRL1), have been implicated in this disease. This report describes molecular diagnosis in a consecutive series of 600 individuals with clinical features of HHT disease. Each coding exon and flanking intronic regions of ENG and ACVRL1 genes was sequenced. Exonic copy number was quantified in probands without a coding sequence mutation. Novel nonsynonymous variants were further analyzed to predict functional consequences. In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes and haplotypes for the two genes were compared between individuals with and without mutations. The highest mutation detection rate (87% [95% CI 80.2-91.5]) was observed in probands who met all four Curacao criteria (epistaxis, telangiectases, AVMs and family history). More than 30% of identified mutations were novel; however, only 6% were variants of unknown significance. Determining the significance of novel mutations as related to disease presents additional challenges. Detection of multiple alterations in the same proband also requires careful evaluation for disease association. In conclusion, the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is highest in probands with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of HHT. However, a substantial fraction of probands in this group do not carry an identifiable mutation in the coding exons of these two genes. This suggests alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation or involvement of alternate loci, and it requires further investigation.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.1.

Fourteen distinct** histopathologic tumor** types were identified. The most common tumor types were carcinoid (8), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (7), and pleuropulmonary blastoma (6). Rare pediatric lung tumors including small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were also seen. The mortality rate was 17.5% (7) in our series. **Chemotherapy** was used in 23% (9) and **radiation** in 20% (8) of the patients. Of the 33 survivors, 28 had follow-up with a median duration of 29.5 months (mean, 63.2 months; range, 1-471 months). Primary lung tumors in children are rare and histopathologically diverse. The tumor spectrum involves many types not seen in adults, and unlike adults, patients rarely have a history of exposure to external predisposing factors. Although complete resection remains the standard for treatment of most tumors, addition of adjuvant therapy is dependent on both tumor stage and histopathologic type.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

On culture the abscess yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Candida guilliermondii.
21290179	Natural history and outcome of hepatic vascular malformations in a large cohort of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia.	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disease characterized by teleangiectasias involving virtually every organ. There are limited data in the literature regarding the natural history of liver vascular malformations in hemorrhagic telangiectasia and their associated morbidity and mortality. This prospective cohort study sought to assess the outcome of liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients. We analyzed 16 years of surveillance data from a tertiary hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center in Italy. We considered for inclusion in this study 502 consecutive Italian patients at risk of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who presented at the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia referral center and underwent a multidisciplinary screening protocol for the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Of the 502 individuals assessed in the center, 154 had hepatic vascular malformations and were the subject of the study; 198 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and without hepatic vascular malformations were the controls. Additionally, we report the response to treatment of patients with complicated hepatic vascular malformations. The 154 patients were included and followed for a median period of 44 months (range 12-181); of these, eight (5.2%) died from VM-related complications and 39 (25.3%) experienced complications. The average incidence rates of death and complications were 1.1 and 3.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. The median overall survival and event-free survival after diagnosis were 175 and 90 months, respectively. The rate of complete response to therapy was 63%. This study shows that substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with liver vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

21336824	Reproducibility of oxygen saturation monitoring during six-minute walk test and exercise stress test in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are at risk for multiple complications and require close follow-up. We investigated the reproducibility of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and exercise stress test (EST) for the evaluation of low oxygen saturation in patients with PAVMs. Twenty-two patients with PAVMs, most of whom had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), participated in a Human Investigations Committee-approved protocol. Patients ranged from 9 to 74 years of age (mean 28) and had a broad spectrum of anatomic subtypes of PAVMs, including focal and diffuse. Standard 6MWT and cycle ergometry EST were both performed twice with adequate rest between tests. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were measured at the beginning and end of each test. Distance walked and maximum resistance was also recorded. The intraclass correlation coefficients (r(i)) at the end of 6MWT were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.940; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.973; 95% CI 0.933-0.989), and distance (r(i) = 0.942; 95% CI 0.867-0.975). The r(i)s at the end of EST were as follows: HR (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.865-0.975), oxygen saturation (r(i) = 0.993; 95% CI 0.982-0.997), and maximum resistance (r(i) = 0.941; 95% CI 0.864-0.975). 6MWT and EST were reproducible measures of exercise capacity and oxygen saturation and are potential adjunct tests in the follow-up assessment for patients with PAVMs.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

21344445	Efficacy of intranasal Bevacizumab (Avastin) treatment in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated epistaxis	Intranasal Bevacizumab is an effective therapy for epistaxis in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Retrospective chart review. In 32 successive patients presenting with recurrent HHT epistaxis 25-100 mg of Bevacizumab was applied intranasally either as a submucosal injection or as a topical spray between November 2008 and May 2010. In many of the injected patients, the Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) laser was used adjunctively for vessel photocoagulation. A phone interview was performed in July 2010 to assess for treatment efficacy. All 32 treated patients were contacted with pre- and posttreatment epistaxis severity scores (ESS) compared. Seventeen patients received topical Bevacizumab, 10 patients received a submucosal injection, and 5 patients received both. In addition, 12 patients were also treated with the KTP laser at the time of their submucosal injection. In the pretreatment period the average ESS was 7.0 (SD = 2.1), whereas in the posttreatment group the average ESS was 2.9 (SD = 1.7). This represents a significant improvement in epistaxis severity (P < .0001). In HHT patients intranasal Bevacizumab, applied as a topical spray or a submucosal injection, significantly improves epistaxis as measured by the Epistaxis Severity Score.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

22213836	Pial arteriovenous fistulae in pediatric patients: associated syndromes and treatment outcome	Pediatric pial arteriovenous fistulae (pAVF) are rare vascular lesions of the CNS, reported to have up to a 25% association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The presentation, treatment and syndromes associated with pAVF in children are reported here. A pediatric database for pAVF was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carotid-cavernous fistulae, dural arteriovenous fistulae, brain arteriovenous malformations and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Radiographic outcome was assessed using digital subtraction angiography, and clinical outcome by the Functional Status Scale (6=normal, maximal incapacity=30). Between July 2003 and June 2011, seven patients with pAVF (six intracranial and one spinal) were treated. Mean age was 4.2 years. The most common clinical presentation was high output cardiac failure (43%). Two patients (29%) harbored a known mutation in the RASA1 gene, associated with a hereditary vascular syndrome: capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. No patient had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Treatment resulted in complete lesional obliteration in six of seven patients, with treatment ongoing in the seventh. Five of seven patients had combined endovascular and surgical treatment while two underwent endovascular embolization alone. Functional Status Scale scores at the most recent follow-up were 6 in all but one patient who had presented with a pretreatment hemianopsia. Treatment is effective in obliterating pAVF in children, with an excellent prognosis seen in our cohort. Genetic screening is indicated, with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation being the most frequently seen syndrome. No patients had hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.3.

22240227	Pleural effusion in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: hemothorax or empyema?	In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations frequently lead to complications. In a case of pleural effusion in a patient with known pulmonary arterio-venous malformations, the first diagnosis to consider is a hemothorax even though alternatives such as empyema are possible. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with bilateral arteriovenous malformations, who was admitted to the emergency department with subacute dyspnoea and left thoracic pain. The clinical examination suggested a hemothorax. Pulmonary angiography was performed and showed an arteriovenous malformation in the left lower lobe. Embolisation was undertaken and at the same time a chest tube was inserted. Pus was evacuated leading to the final diagnosis of pleural empyema. Progress was good despite an episode acute respiratory distress due to a pulmonary embolism. Pleural empyema is rarely described in the context of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. In the case of pleural effusion this diagnosis should be considered even though hemothorax is more common.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

22281938	Cost savings through molecular diagnosis for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder of vascular development resulting in direct connections between the arterial and venous systems, bypassing capillaries. Symptoms and signs can appear throughout life and marked intrafamilial variability confounds diagnosis based purely on clinical criteria. We set out to determine the impact of genetic testing on the cost of screening for HHT in at-risk relatives. We performed economic modeling of idealized pedigrees following two scenarios: repeated clinical screening until an HHT diagnosis could be either affirmed or excluded, and mutation testing in the proband, followed by genetic testing of at-risk relatives and clinical monitoring of only those relatives who test positive for the familial mutation. Based on actual reimbursement data from our region's largest health insurer, the molecular diagnostic model saved over $22,000 for a family with four relatives at risk for the initial diagnostic work-up. For a cohort of 100 probands, the total savings for the molecular diagnostic model over a reasonable period of follow-up was greater than $9 million. In this idealized setting in which all probands and at-risk relatives accepted molecular testing, the economic advantages of genetic screening over repeated clinical screening are substantial.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

22331366	Juvenile polyposis, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and early onset colorectal cancer in patients with SMAD4 mutation	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by mutation in the endoglin or ALK1 genes. A distinct syndrome combines the clinical features of HHT and juvenile polyposis (JP) and has been associated with SMAD4 mutation. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotype of patients with JP-HHT and SMAD4 mutations and to compare this phenotype with HHT or JP patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients prospectively enrolled in the Toronto HHT and JP databases who underwent genotyping were included. The phenotypic characteristics of JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutations and patients with mutations other than SMAD4 were analyzed and compared. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent genetic testing (HHT, n = 332; JP, n = 26). Among fourteen patients identified with SMAD4 mutations, ten met the clinical diagnostic criteria for both JP and HHT (71%). Patients with SMAD4 mutations had 100% penetrance of the polyposis phenotype. All patients with JP and SMAD4 mutation had features of HHT. Three JP-HHT patients developed early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (mean age 28 years). JP-HHT patients with SMAD4 mutation had a significantly higher rate of anemia than HHT patients with mutations other than SMAD4. Patients with HHT and SMAD4 mutations are at significant risk of JP and CRC. The gastrointestinal phenotype is similar to JP patients without SMAD4 mutation. It is essential for HHT patients to undergo genetic testing to determine if they have SMAD4 mutations so that appropriate gastrointestinal screening and surveillance for JP and CRC can be completed.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

22469609	Local sclerotherapy with polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) for the treatment of Epistaxis in Rendu-Osler-Weber or Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT): 15 years of experience	Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant vascular disease characterized by mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases and localized arteriovenous malformations in lung, brain and liver. Epistaxis, due to rupture of telangiectases of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients. Though several treatments have been used to reduce epistaxis, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (Aethoxysklerol®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results. After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of all cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects. There was just one case of septal perforation, another with increased septal perforation, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and blurred vision for a few minutes. In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

22553411	Gastric angiodysplasia in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 patient	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited disease that occurs in approximately one in 5000 to 8000 people. Clinical diagnosis of HHT is made when a person presents three of the following four criteria: family history, recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom, AVMs affecting the lungs, brain and GI tract provoke a more serious outcome. Heterozygous mutations in endoglin, activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1), and SMAD4, the genes involved in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling cascade, cause HHT. **We report here the case of a 63 year-old male patient who presented melena and GI bleeding episodes, proven to be caused by bleeding from multiple gastric angiodysplasia. **Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia throughout the stomach. **Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation was performed to control bleeding from a gastric angiodysplasia. **The patient has been admitted several times with episodes of hemoptysis and hematochezia. One year ago, the patient was hospitalized due to right-sided weakness, which was caused by left basal ganglia hemorrhage as the part of HHT presentation. In family history, the patient's mother and elder sister had died, due to intracranial hemorrhage, and his eldest son has been suffered from recurrent epistaxis for 20 years.

22670022	The intersection of genes and environment: development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and stimulant exposure	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The triggers that promote the development of PAH in HHT remain poorly understood. We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with decompensated right-sided heart failure secondary to newly diagnosed PAH. The clinical diagnosis of HHT was confirmed on the basis of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple typical mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. There was also a suggestive family history. The patient was discovered to have active and extensive stimulant abuse in addition to HHT. We concluded that there may be a temporal relationship between exposure to stimulants and development of PAH in a host with underlying gene mutation. This case highlights the paradigm of PAH development after environmental exposure in a genetically susceptible host.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Ultrasound examinations showed splenomegaly as well as portal hypertension. Blood examinations revealed low levels of haemoglobin**. CT imaging showed multiple arteriovenous malformations with arterioportal shunts within the liver which led to a volume-induced portal hypertension. The genetic analysis revealed no mutations in the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 or endoglin genes. The patient was clinically diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Because of the multiple arterioportal shunts within the liver and the resulting portal hypertension with live-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, the only therapeutic option for the patient is liver transplantation. Therefore, an application for a standard exception was made at Eurotransplant and the patient is going to be liver transplantated within the next months. Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease which leads to arteriovenous malformations and which can affect different organ systems. The course of the disease can be rather benign, but it can also lead to live-threatening complications requiring fast interventions.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

22875690	Polymicrobial brain abscess in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler's disease)	A 38-year-old woman who suffered from migraine was admitted because of severe, worsening headache for 24 hours (dissimilar to the previous migraine attacks), with impaired vision and weakness of the right arm. Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded. Physicians should search for cutaneous or mucous teleangiectasias. Family screening and long-term follow-up according to international guidelines is recommended.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.3.

22991266	Brain arteriovenous malformations associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: gene-phenotype correlations	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with a wide spectrum of vascular malformations (VMs) involving multiple organs. Nine to 16% of patients with HHT harbor brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can cause intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective was to study clinical manifestations of brain AVMs in patients with HHT and correlate these with the specific gene mutated. We reviewed records of 171 patients with HHT and brain AVMs. A history of ICH was found in 27% (41/152) patients, with a mean age of 26 ± 18 range, (0-68) years. All of patients with ICH were neurologically asymptomatic prior to ICH. Multiple brain AVMs were found in 23% (170/39) of patients on initial examination. Genetic test results were available in 109 (64%) patients. Mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4 were present in 75 (69%), 18 (17%), and 2 (2%), respectively. A history of ICH was reported in 24% of patients with an ENG mutation and 27% of patients with an ACVRL1 mutation, with a mean age of 26 ± 16 (range, 2-50) and 18 ± 21 (0-48) years, respectively. No statistically significant differences in age at first brain AVM diagnosis, prevalence of ICH history, age at ICH, or other manifestations of brain AVMs were observed among gene groups. In conclusion, no evidence for differences in brain AVM characteristics was observed among HHT gene groups, although we cannot exclude clinically important differences. Larger studies are needed to further guide brain AVM screening decisions in patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.1.

23303231	A case of combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia associated with SMAD4 mutation	A 47-year-old man was found to have abnormal findings on chest radiography. Chest computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that he had a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. He had experienced epistaxis when he was a junior high school student, and since then, the symptom had frequently recurred. Further, he had telangiectasia on the lips. Thus, he was given a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Endoscopy revealed gastric telangiectasia, and in addition, his colon had many juvenile polyps. When he was 49 years of age, he underwent genetic analysis for HHT. A diagnosis of juvenile polyposis-HHT combined syndrome (JP-HHT) was made since a heterozygous germline 4-base deletion in exon 9 of SMAD4 was detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of JP-HHT associated with SMAD4 mutation in Japan.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Three out of four criteria are required for a definite clinical diagnosis HHT, two criteria are considered ""possible"" HHT, and 0 or 1 criterion makes the diagnosis unlikely. However, these consensus diagnostic criteria have not been validated. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical criteria. A total of 450 consecutive persons ≥16 years of age were screened for HHT between May 2004 and September 2009, including a chest CT to screen for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). We selected 263 first-degree relatives of disease-causing mutation carriers who underwent mutation analysis. Genetic test results were considered the gold standard. The family mutation was present in 186 patients (mean age 42.9 ± 14.6 yr; 54.8% female). A clinical diagnosis was definite, ""possible"", and unlikely in 168 (90.3%), 17 (9.1%), and 1 (0.5%) patient, respectively.

24146883	Hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirements, hematinics and hepcidin define hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia as a model of hemorrhagic iron deficiency	Iron deficiency anemia remains a major global health problem. Higher iron demands provide the potential for a targeted preventative approach before anemia develops. The primary study objective was to develop and validate a metric that stratifies recommended dietary iron intake to compensate for patient-specific non-menstrual hemorrhagic losses. The secondary objective was to examine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to under-replacement of epistaxis (nosebleed) hemorrhagic iron losses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The hemorrhage adjusted iron requirement (HAIR) sums the recommended dietary allowance, and iron required to replace additional quantified hemorrhagic losses, based on the pre-menopausal increment to compensate for menstrual losses (formula provided). In a study population of 50 HHT patients completing concurrent dietary and nosebleed questionnaires, 43/50 (86%) met their recommended dietary allowance, but only 10/50 (20%) met their HAIR. Higher HAIR was a powerful predictor of lower hemoglobin (p = 0.009), lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin content (p<0.001), lower log-transformed serum iron (p = 0.009), and higher log-transformed red cell distribution width (p<0.001). There was no evidence of generalised abnormalities in iron handling Ferritin and ferritin(2) explained 60% of the hepcidin variance (p<0.001), and the mean hepcidinferritin ratio was similar to reported controls. Iron supplement use increased the proportion of individuals meeting their HAIR, and blunted associations between HAIR and hematinic indices. Once adjusted for supplement use however, reciprocal relationships between HAIR and hemoglobin/serum iron persisted. Of 568 individuals using iron tablets, most reported problems completing the course. For patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, persistent anemia was reported three-times more frequently if iron tablets caused diarrhea or needed to be stopped. HAIR values, providing an indication of individuals' iron requirements, may be a useful tool in prevention, assessment and management of iron deficiency. Iron deficiency in HHT can be explained by under-replacement of nosebleed hemorrhagic iron losses.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

24260769	Pilot study of submucosal radiofrequency for epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	To assess the safety and efficacy of submucosal radiofrequency (RF) treatment for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with mild or moderate epistaxis. We carried out a prospective pilot study of 16 consecutive patients with HHT-related epistaxis from June 2010 to April 2012. Under local anesthesia, RF was applied to one or both sides of the nose from the columella beneath the septal mucosal (50 joules per puncture). Patients were sent a questionnaire at least six months after the procedure. RF under local anesthesia was well tolerated, according to visual analog scale scores. Neither crusting nor pain was reported one week after the intervention. The frequency of epistaxis per day and per month was significantly lower after RF. The duration of bleeding also decreased from more than 10 minutes to less than 5 minutes in two thirds of patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were satisfied with the technique and would request it for subsequent procedures to treat repeated bleeding. Submucosal RF treatment for HHT is a safe, well tolerated procedure with significant efficacy in the short term. It should be considered as an alternative technique for managing HHT-related epistaxis, although long-term results remain to be evaluated.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

24268183	VarRanker: rapid prioritization of sequence variations associated with human disease	Identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics. While many algorithms have been developed to predict the degree of damage caused by a given sequence alteration, few tools are able to incorporate information about a given phenotype of interest. Here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype. Phenotypes are described by a list of scored terms supplied by the user. These terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including NCBI gene summaries, PubMed abstracts, and Gene Ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in String-DB to determine a relevance score. The overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest. We demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). We have also implemented a web-based application which allows public access to the VarRanker algorithm. Automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease. However, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	0.3.

24986705	Roles of cyclooxygenase 2 and hepatic venous flow in patients with HHT or hepatopulmonary syndrome	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and hepatopulmonary syndrome are disorders characterized by the development of multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM). COX2 may be at the origin of a cascade of pro inflammatory events to favour angiogenesis and PAVM development. HHT and hepatopulmonary syndrome mouse models may be used to show its effects on PAVM formation. Anti COX-2 therapy could also be tested in human individuals, particularly in patients presenting a hepatopulmonary syndrome or HHT with small PAVM. PAVMs are one of the main causes of morbidity in patients presenting with HHT disease, owing to the risks of rupture as well as paradoxical embolism exposing to stroke and/or cerebral abscess. Percutaneous embolization has become the treatment of choice of PAVM. Anti COX2 may prevent from PAVM development and subsequent related complications and avoid either surgery and/or percutaneous embolization and thus subsequent related complication.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	0.3.

25140883	Histogram flow mapping with optical coherence tomography for in vivo skin angiography of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Speckle statistics of flowing scatterers have been well documented in the literature. Speckle variance optical coherence tomography exploits the large variance values of intensity changes in time caused mainly by the random backscattering of light resulting from translational activity of red blood cells to map out the microvascular networks. A method to map out the microvasculature malformation of skin based on the time-domain histograms of individual pixels is presented with results obtained from both normal skin and skin containing vascular malformation. Results demonstrated that this method can potentially map out deeper blood vessels and enhance the visualization of microvasculature in low signal regions, while being resistant against motion (e.g., patient tremor or internal reflex movements). The overall results are manifested as more uniform en face projection maps of microvessels. Potential applications include clinical imaging of skin vascular abnormalities and wide-field skin angiography for the study of complex vascular networks.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Portosystemic encephalopathy in a patient with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease is rare, but we experienced a case presenting with recurrent portosystemic encephalopathy in Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. We report on a case of a 75-year-old female presenting with an altered mentality. Initial studies including brain imaging study did not reveal any specific cause for her mental status. She was **diagnosed** with the rare disease after a series of tests and received conservative treatment. Her neurological status recovered fully without complication after conservative treatment and she was discharged after 18 hospital days. This case demonstrated an extremely rare case of Osler-Weber-Rendu disease presenting as portosystemic encephalopathy treated successfully with conservative treatment. For patients who have shown hepatic encephalopathy without a definite cause, we recommend evaluation for the possibility of Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. Conservative treatment based on treatment of advanced liver cirrhosis could be an alternative solution.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.3.

25847705	The ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G polymorphism is associated with organ vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients with ENG mutations, but not in patients with ACVRL1 mutations	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by vascular malformations (VMs) and caused by mutations in TGFβ/BMP9 pathway genes, most commonly ENG or ACVRL1. Patients with HHT have diverse manifestations related to skin and mucosal telangiectases and organ VMs, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical heterogeneity of HHT suggests a role for genetic modifiers. We hypothesized that the ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G and ENG c.207G>A polymorphisms, previously associated with sporadic brain AVM, are associated with organ VM in HHT. We genotyped these variants in 716 patients with HHT and evaluated association of genotype with presence of any organ VM, and specifically with brain VM, liver VM and pulmonary AVM, by multivariate logistic regression analyses stratified by HHT mutation. Among all patients with HHT, neither polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of any organ VM; ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G showed a trend toward association with pulmonary AVM (OR = 1.48, P = 0.062). ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was significantly associated with any VM among patients with HHT with ENG (OR = 2.66, P = 0.022), but not ACVRL1 (OR = 0.79, P = 0.52) mutations. ACVRL1 c.314-35A>G was also associated with pulmonary AVM and liver VM among ENG mutation heterozygotes. There were no significant associations between ENG c.207G>A and any VM phenotype. These results suggest that common polymorphisms in HHT genes other than the mutated gene modulate phenotype severity of HHT disease, specifically presence of organ VM.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

25931195	Prevalence of thoracic aortopathy in patients with juvenile Polyposis Syndrome-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia due to SMAD4	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by abnormal vascular structures that may present as epistaxis, telangiectasias, and/or arteriovenous malformations. The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGFβ pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGFβ signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

We aimed to describe echocardiographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with coexisting HHT and PH. We conducted a single-center cohort study of patients with confirmed HHT who underwent right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography for suspected PH between June 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. Of 38 patients with confirmed HHT who underwent RHC and echocardiography, 28 (74%) had a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg. Of those 28, 12 (43%) had pulmonary arterial hypertension. Two patients had normal PAWP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with PH secondary to either an atrial septal defect or high cardiac flow. Fourteen patients (50%) had elevated PAWP (≥ 15 mm Hg), nine with evidence of high flow. RHC in all 28 patients demonstrated a MPAP of 41 ± 11 mm Hg, PAWP of 17 ± 10 mm Hg, and PVR of 4.5 ± 4.2 Wood units. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction in nine patients (32%). The presence of PH trended toward worse survival (P = .06). PH in patients with HHT occurs by different mechanisms, and there is a trend toward worse survival in patients who develop PH despite the mechanism. The equal predilection toward all subtypes of PH illustrates the necessity of RHC to clarify the hemodynamics.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

26261842	Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation-etiology, clinical four case presentations and review of the literature	Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare clinical condition with abnormal direct communication between the branches of pulmonary artery and vein. It may occur as an isolated anomaly or in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Although these vascular pulmonary pathologies are quite uncommon, they are the important part of the differential diagnosis of common pulmonary problems such as hypoxemia and pulmonary nodules. The diagnosis of PAVM in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. The most common clinical signs of PAVM are recurrent episodes of epistaxis and hemoptysis, so surgical resection is deemed the best curative option to avoid further episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis. Quite often the diagnosis is established after pathohistological examinations. We report a case of a female patient with a massive recurrent hemoptysis and without pathologic radiological findings which would suggest to PAVM and who was successfully treated with lobectomy.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

26608985	Thalidomide Effects in Patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia During Therapeutic Treatment and in Fli-EGFP Transgenic Zebrafish Model	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations. The efficacy of traditional treatments for HHT is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic role of thalidomide in HHT patients and the effect in FLI-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model. HHT was diagnosed according to Shovlin criteria. Five HHT patients were treated with thalidomide (100 mg/d). The Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), telangiectasia spots, and hepatic computed tomography angiography (CTA) were used to assess the clinical efficacy of thalidomide. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model was investigated for the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis. Dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, ELISA and Western blotting from patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) messenger RNA (mRNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein before and after 6 months of thalidomide treatment. The average ESS before and after thalidomide were 6.966 ± 3.093 and 1.799 ± 0.627, respectively (P = 0.009). The ""telangiectatic spot"" on the tongue almost vanished; CTA examination of case 2 indicated a smaller proximal hepatic artery and decreased or ceased hepatic artery collateral circulation. The Fli-EGFP zebrafish model manifested discontinuous vessel development and vascular occlusion (7 of 10 fishes), and the TGF-β3 mRNA expression of five patients was lower after thalidomide therapy. The plasma VEGF protein expression was down-regulated in HHT patients. Thalidomide reverses telangiectasia and controls nosebleeds by down-regulating the expression of TGF-β3 and VEGF in HHT patients.

26998137	Small bowel adenocarcinoma arising in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: A case report	Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are reportedly at a lower overall risk of malignancies, and small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) arising in a HHT patient is extremely rare. In this study, the case of a 37-year-old female with HHT who developed a poorly differentiated jejunal adenocarcinoma five years after ileocecal resection for multiple colonic adenomas is presented. The patient underwent curative resection of the cancer invading the ileum and the mesentery of the transverse colon, but had to overcome critical complications perioperatively, stemming from HHT-associated peripheral capillary dilatation and arteriovenous malformation, including nosebleeds and possible infusion-induced air embolism through pulmonary shunts. The patient subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy including capecitabine and oxaliplatin for 6 months, and currently remains alive without any evidence of recurrence 12 months after the second surgery. This patient with SBA was an instructive case demonstrating the necessity of careful attention during major surgery in HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

27012295	Neurovascular Manifestations of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: A Consecutive Series of 376 Patients during 15 Years.	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is associated with a wide range of neurovascular abnormalities. The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain arteriovenous malformations, in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and to study associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and demographic variables, genetic mutations, and the presence of AVMs in other organs. Consecutive patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia who underwent brain MR imaging/MRA, CTA, or DSA at our institution from 2001 to 2015 were included. All studies were re-evaluated by 2 senior neuroradiologists for the presence, characteristics, location, and number of brain arteriovenous malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and nonshunting lesions. Brain arteriovenous malformations were categorized as high-flow pial fistulas, nidus-type brain AVMs, and capillary vascular malformations and were assigned a Spetzler-Martin score. We examined the association between baseline clinical and genetic mutational status and the presence/multiplicity of brain arteriovenous malformations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were included. One hundred ten brain arteriovenous malformations were noted in 48 patients (12.8%), with multiple brain arteriovenous malformations in 26 patients. These included 51 nidal brain arteriovenous malformations (46.4%), 58 capillary vascular malformations (52.7%), and 1 pial arteriovenous fistula (0.9%). Five patients (10.4%) with single nidal brain arteriovenous malformation presented with hemorrhage. Of brain arteriovenous malformations, 88.9% (88/99) had a Spetzler-Martin score of ≤2. Patients with brain arteriovenous malformations were more likely to be female (75.0% versus 57.6%, P = .01) and have a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (95.8% versus 84.8%, P = .04). The prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformation was 19.7% in endoglin (ENG) mutations and 12.5% in activin receptor-like kinase (1ACVRL1) mutations. Our study of 376 patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrated a high prevalence of brain arteriovenous malformations. Nidal brain arteriovenous malformations and capillary vascular malformations occurred in roughly equal numbers.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

27027094	Implications of an Incidental Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation	Introduction. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have been associated with life-threatening complications, such as stroke and massive hemoptysis, thus posing significant morbidity if left untreated. We report a case of an incidental finding of a PAVM in a trauma patient newly recognized to have suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Case Description. A 34-year-old man with a history of recurrent epistaxis presented with a sudden fall associated with seizure-like activity. Trauma imaging showed a large subdural hematoma and, incidentally, a serpiginous focus within the right upper lobe with a prominent feeding artery consistent with a PAVM. The patient was diagnosed with a simple PAVM related to possible or suspected HHT, an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance. He underwent a pulmonary arteriography of the right upper and lower lobe with the use of a microcatheter system; however, the PAVM could not be visualized. Thus, he was managed medically. The patient was educated on the need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures and surveillance imaging. Discussion. Our case highlights the importance of obtaining a complete past medical and family history in young patients with a history of recurrent epistaxis to elicit features of HHT. The diagnosis can be made clinically and directly affects family members, who would otherwise not receive appropriate screening.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

27225226	Definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in a 60-year-old black Kenyan woman: a case report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by vascular dysplasia. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case in the literature of definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia diagnosed in western Kenya, a resource-limited setting with limited treatment options. A 60-year-old black Kenyan woman was admitted 1 year ago to a hospital in western Kenya with an 11-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis. Her physical examination revealed that she had telangiectasias on the tongue and hard palate, severe pallor, and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe opacity. After a positive saline contrast echocardiography, she underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography, which revealed a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and multiple hepatic arteriovenous malformations. Therefore, she fulfilled criteria for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was managed with nasal packing, tranexamic acid, oral ferrous sulfate, and blood transfusions, as other treatment options were unavailable in this setting. This rare case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates that it occurs in an African population and that diagnostic challenges in resource-limited settings can be surmounted. Treatment options remain limited in these settings.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

27997001	A rare cardiomegaly	We present the case of a patient who came to our attention for enlargement of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Echocardiography showed moderate diastolic overload of both ventricles with enhanced cardiac output without valvular disease or cardiac shunt that could account for this cardiomegaly.

28267932	Hemoglobin Is a Vital Determinant of Arterial Oxygen Content in Hypoxemic Patients with Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations	PaO2 and SaO2 are commonly measured in respiratory practice, but arterial oxygen content (CaO2) refers to the volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit blood volume. CaO2 is calculated from SaO2 and the hemoglobin concentration in blood, recognizing that each gram of hemoglobin can transport approximately 1.34 ml of oxygen when fully saturated. To prospectively evaluate serial changes in CaO2 in humans, incorporating and excluding dynamic changes to oxygenation and hemoglobin parameters that may occur during life. A cohort of 497 consecutive patients at risk of both hypoxemia and anemia were recruited. The patients had radiologically proven pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which result in hypoxemia due to right-to-left shunting, and concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, which placed them at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to recurrent hemorrhagic iron losses. Presentation SaO2 (breathing room air, by pulse oximetry), hemoglobin, red cell and iron indices were measured, and CaO2 calculated as SaO2 × hemoglobin × 1.34 ml/g. Serial measurements were evaluated in 100 cases spanning up to 32.1 (median, 10.5) years. Presentation CaO2 ranged from 7.6 to 27.5 (median, 17.6) ml/dl. CaO2 did not change appreciably across the SaO2 quartiles. In contrast, hemoglobin ranged from 5.9 to 21.8 g/dl (median, 14.1 g/dl), with a linear increase in CaO2 across hemoglobin quartiles. After PAVM embolization and an immediate increase in SaO2, hemoglobin fell and CaO2 was unchanged 1.6-12 (median, 4) months later. When hemoglobin fell because of iron deficiency, there was no change in SaO2. Similarly, when hemoglobin rose after iron treatment, there was no change in SaO2, and the expected CaO2 increment was observed. These relationships were not evident during pregnancy when hemoglobin fell, and PAVMs usually deteriorated: in pregnancy SaO2 commonly increased, and serial CaO2 values (incorporating hemodilution/anemia) more accurately reflected deteriorating PAVM status. An apparent fall in CaO2 with age in females was attributable to the development of iron deficiency. There was an unexplained increase in CaO2 with age in follow-up of males after embolization. Hemoglobin/CaO2 should be further incorporated into oxygenation considerations. More attention should be given to modest changes in hemoglobin that substantially modify CaO2.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY	1.3.

28578477	Prevalence of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in patients operated for cerebral abscess: a retrospective cohort analysis	It is well described that patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) have an increased risk of cerebral abscess (CA). However, as both CA and HHT are rare, the proportion of patients with CA who are diagnosed with HHT has not been previously described. A retrospective study was carried out of all patients treated surgically for CA between January 1995 and September 2014 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Odense University Hospital. The cases were then cross-referenced with the Danish HHT database. Eighty patients aged 5-79 years were included. The incidence of CA was 0.33/100,000/year. Two patients (2.5%) were registered as having HHT. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 70% of all cases, most frequently streptococci species (46.3%). The most common predisposing condition was odontogenic infection (20%), followed by post-operative infection (13.8%) and post-trauma (6.3%). Patients undergoing a full diagnostic program to determine predisposing conditions causing CA increased over the 20-year period from 11.8% to 65.2%. The 3-month and 1-year mortality rates were 7.5% and 11.25%, respectively. There is an overrepresentation of HHT patients in a cohort of patients with CA, and HHT should be investigated as the cause of the CA if no other apparent cause can be identified.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

While the pathophysiology underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with HHT is not fully understood, it is believed to occur by one of two mechanisms: increases in pulmonary vascular resistance or cardiac output. In the following report, we describe an interesting case of a 26-year-old woman with HHT whose right heart catheterization initially demonstrated PH with elements of both pre- and post-capillary PH. Once the pre-capillary PH component was treated, however, an underlying high-normal cardiac-output state was unmasked.

28810087	Multiple Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations: An Unusual Cause of Shortness of Breath and Recurrent Strokes	To discuss an uncommon case of a patient with multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) presenting with dyspnea on exertion and recurrent strokes. A 79-year-old woman with recent onset recurrent cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) was referred to cardiology for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. Clinical examination was unrevealing. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with agitated saline was suggestive of an extra-cardiac shunt. Subsequent chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated five large PAVMs. The patient underwent transcatheter coil embolization of the five PAVMs, resulting in marked improvement in dyspnea and resolution of the shunt on bubble study echocardiography. Although PAVMs are rare, they remain an important entity to consider when evaluating patients with extracardiac shunts. They may present with nonspecific features such as dyspnea on exertion and recurrent CVAs. All patients with multiple PAVMs should undergo thorough skin screening for telangiectasia as well as radiologic imaging to screen for additional AVMs in the liver and brain in order to exclude hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

28989145	Clinical and genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia family	To investigate the clinical features and feasibility genetic diagnosis in a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) family, and to explore the application of gene mutation testing in HHT diagnosis.  Methods: Medical histories and clinical features of a family were analyzed to diagnose HHT patients and suspected individuals according to the clinical diagnostic criteria. Sequence analysis of endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor like type 1 (ACVRL1) gene in the proband was performed with PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. After the possible pathogenic mutation was identified in the proband, the specific mutation was detected in the suspected individuals and part of other family members. Then the genetic diagnoses were concluded.  Results: There were 5 family members in 4 generations manifested with epistaxis. According to the clinical diagnosis criteria, the proband with epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, visceral arteriovenous malformation and family history was diagnosed as HHT; while 2 survival family members with epistaxis and family history were suspected individuals. A substitution mutation in the 5'-untranslated region(5'-UTR) of ENG c.1-127 C>T was detected in the proband and the 2 suspected individuals, which did not exist in other family members. Based on the clinical and genetic findings, the 2 clinically suspected individuals were diagnosed as HHT.  Conclusion: There is great variability of the clinical manifestations among HHT patients. ENG c.1-127 C>T mutation is the possible pathogenic variant of the HHT family.

29243366	ENG mutational mosaicism in a family with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4. Around 90% of HHT patients present with a heterozygous pathogenic genetic variation. Almost all cases of HHT have a family history. Very few cases are de novo or mosaicism. We describe a case with mutational mosaicism that would not be observed in the clinical routine when using Sanger sequencing or a NGS read coverage below app. 100. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and buccal swabs. The coding region, exon-intron boundaries, and the flanking sequences of the genes were sequenced by NGS. The proband had clinical HHT fulfilling the Curaçao criteria and genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in ENG. The mother of the proband, also with clinical HHT, was found negative when analyzing DNA from blood for the familial mutation using Sanger sequencing. Analyzing her DNA by NGS HHT panel sequencing when extracted from both peripheral blood leukocytes, and cheek swabs, identified the familial ENG mutation at low levels. We provide evidence of ENG mutational mosaicism in an individual presenting with clinical HHT. These findings illustrate the importance of considering mutational mosaicism.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

Prospective, noncomparative study. Patients treated for HHT-associated epistaxis by intranasal submucosal bevacizumab injections between June 2011 and August 2013 were included and followed prospectively. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by the epistaxis severity score (ESS); the epistaxis intensity, frequency, and the need of blood transfusion (IFT) score; and hemoglobin levels. Thirty-three patients were included. The total number of treatments with intranasal bevacizumab injection was 210. The mean number of treatments per patient was 6.2 ± 4.6 (range, 1-16), and the mean treatment and observation period was 38.8 ± 21.8 months (range, 2-66 months). Four patients showed no improvement after treatment. Eleven patients (33.3%) showed initial improvement in both ESS and IFT, but the treatment was discontinued before the end of the study because the effect became gradually shorter lasting despite repeated injections. Twelve patients (36.3%) continued to have a positive response to the treatment at the end of the study. No local adverse effects were observed, but one patient developed osteonecrosis in both knees during the treatment period. Intranasal bevacizumab injection is an effective treatment for most of the moderate and severe grades of HHT-associated epistaxis. The duration of the effect of the treatment was variable. Primary and late resistance phenomena to the treatment were quite common. 4. Laryngoscope, 128:2237-2244, 2018.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

We introduce our algorithm for the stratified population screening of HHT. Probands are selected from the consecutive hospital database review for HHT (I7800) and recurrent epistaxis (R0400) and the review of patient records referred by family practicioners. A proportion of probands might be de novo diagnosed with HHT in the 10-year study period. The checkup of probands consists of physical examination, arteriovenous malformation exploration and and genetic testing (ACVRL1 and ENG sequence analysis). The family screening of HHT consists of physical examination and screening for the family-specific mutation of each at-risk individual, and furthermore, arteriovenous malformation exploration in individuals with suspected/definite HHT and/or carrying the mutation. Twenty-five definite HHT patients were explored: 7 of them by the I7800 review, 1 by the R0400 review, 3 were de novo diagnosed, and the remaining 14 were explored by the systematic family screening. Considering the 20 patients alive at the end of the study period and the unavailable 5 potential HHT patients and 12 at-risk family members, the HHT prevalence is estimated to be 1:6090-1:11267 in our study area, implying our algorithm's effectivity in the stratified population screening of HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Analysis included 88 untreated PAVMs from 21 patients (6 male;15 female; mean age at presentation 47 y; range, 12-68 y). Two CT studies with the longest interval between were evaluated (mean 8.4 y; median 8.8 y; range, 3.1-14.1 y). Measurement of feeding artery diameter and anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) sac dimensions for each PAVM was performed separately by 2 radiologists blinded to patient and CT order. Statistical analysis was performed to determine change in size between earliest and follow-up imaging. Mean feeding artery diameter, AP sac dimension, and ML sac dimension were 1.4 mm (range, 0.8-3.7 mm), 4.3 mm (range, 2.1-11.1 mm), and 4.1 mm (range, 1.8-9.2 mm) on earliest imaging and 1.4 mm (range, 0.9-2.6 mm), 4.5 mm (range, 2.2-12.2 mm), and 4.3 mm (range, 2.0-9.6 mm) on follow-up. Model-based mean analysis showed no statistically significant change in dimension of any variable between earliest and follow-up imaging. Secondary analysis including age also found no statistically significant difference (feeding diameter, P = .09; AP sac dimension, P = .9; ML sac dimension, P = .1). Analysis including time between measurements found no significant relationship between change in variables and time (feeding artery diameter, P = .4; AP sac dimension, P = .3; ML sac dimension, P = .06). Untreated PAVMs grew slowly, if at all, in a near-decade span, and any demonstrated growth was minimal. These findings challenge the current recommendation of 3- to 5-year CT follow-up.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

32503579	Current HHT genetic overview in Spain and its phenotypic correlation: data from RiHHTa registry	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Disease-causing variants in endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) genes are detected in more than 90% of cases submitted to molecular diagnosis. We used data from the RiHHTa (Computerized Registry of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) registry to describe genetic variants and to assess their genotype-phenotype correlation among HHT patients in Spain. By May 2019, 215 patients were included in the RiHHTa registry with a mean age of 52.5 ± 16.5 years and 136 (63.3%) were women. Definitive HHT diagnosis defined by the Curaçao criteria were met by 172 (80%) patients. Among 113 patients with genetic test, 77 (68.1%) showed a genetic variant in ACVRL1 and 36 (31.8%) in ENG gene. The identified genetic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG genes and their clinical significance are provided. ACVRL1 mutations were more frequently nonsense (50%) while ENG mutations were more frequently, frameshift (39.1%). ENG patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36.9 vs 45.7 years) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (71.4% vs 24.4%) and cerebral AVMs (17.6% vs 2%) more often than patients with ACVRL1 variants. Patients with ACVRL1 variants had a higher cardiac index (2.62 vs 3.46), higher levels of hepatic functional blood tests, and anemia (28.5% vs 56.7%) more often than ENG patients. ACVRL1 variants are more frequent than ENG in Spain. ACVRL1 patients developed symptomatic liver disease and anemia more often than ENG patients. Compared to ACVRL1, those with ENG variants are younger at diagnosis and show pulmonary and cerebral AVMs more frequently.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 are the most common gene mutations reported in HPAH with HHT. We report a 11-year-old boy with a definite diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and suspected HHT with recurrent epistaxis. The results of gene detection showed that there was a nosense mutation in BMPR2. The results of gene detection of ACVRL1, ENG and SMAD4 were normal. Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension with suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Patient was treated with ambrisentan 2.5 mg qd. About a month later, the patient developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding and sudden convulsions. The patient's vital signs were stable after symptomatic treatment. After discharging from hospital, the patients continued to take ambrisentan. No epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding was found in one month of follow-up, but the symptoms of chest tightness were not significantly alleviated. BMPR2 with a nonsense mutation is more likely to cause HPAH with HHT and are more likely to be life-threatening.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM	1.1.

32874383	Left atrial thrombus mimicking myxoma in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of arteriovenous malformations. The arteriovenous shunts may result in high output heart failure, which predisposes to atrial dilatation and atrial fibrillation. Due to recurrent bleeding from epistaxis or the gastrointestinal tract, patients with HHT and atrial fibrillation are at high risk of bleeding if anticoagulated for stroke prevention. In this report, we present a case of a** 74-year-old woman with a history of HHT and atrial fibrillation who developed a large left atrial thrombus that initially was thought to represent an atrial myxoma. **The diagnosis was confirmed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and **the patient underwent surgical resection of the thrombus.** This case demonstrates the role of different imaging modalities in the assessment of left atrial masses and presents an opportunity to review the data on safety of anticoagulation in patients with HHT.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.3.

32899377	Differential Expression of Circulating Plasma miRNA-370 and miRNA-10a from Patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant, vascular disorder that presents with telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations. HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, involving mutations in endoglin (ENG; HHT1) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1; HHT2) genes that account for over 85% of all HHT patients. The current diagnosis of HHT patients remains at the clinical level, but many suspected patients do not have a clear HHT diagnosis or do not show pathogenic mutations in HHT genes. This situation has prompted the search for biomarkers to help in the early diagnosis of the disease. We have analyzed the plasma levels in HHT patients of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs), small single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with specific RNA targets. A total of 16 HHT1 and 17 HHT2 plasma samples from clinically confirmed patients and 16 controls were analyzed in this study. Total RNA was purified from plasma, and three selected miRNAs (miRNA-10a, miRNA-214, and miRNA-370), related to the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases and potentially targeting ENG or ALK1, were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with controls, levels of miRNA-370, whose putative target is ENG, were significantly downregulated in HHT1, but not in HHT2, whereas the levels of miRNA-10a, whose putative target is ALK1, were significantly upregulated in HHT2, but not in HHT1. In addition, the levels of miRNA-214, potentially targeting ENG and ALK1, did not change in either HHT1 or HHT2 patients versus control samples. While further studies are warranted, these results suggest that dysregulated plasma levels of miRNA-370 or miRNA-10a could help to identify undiagnosed HHT1 or HHT2 patients, respectively.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	1.1.

Dietary evaluation is relevant in HHT patients to provide adequate iron and nutrient intake. Additionally, different dietary items have been reported to precipitate epistaxis in this setting. **Our primary aim was to investigate the dietary habits of HHT patients through a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate the presence of precipitants and/or protective factors for epistaxis and the occurrence of possible dietary modifications. The secondary aims were to evaluate the nutritional intake of iron in HHT patients and the self-reported effect of iron treatments on epistaxis**. From April 2018 to October 2018, a 138-item FFQ was provided to HHT patients followed up at the HHT Referral Center of Crema Maggiore Hospital. The relationship between food items and epistaxis was ascertained on a separate form. Daily iron intake was calculated to establish the mean iron content of food items reported in the FFQ. One hundred forty-nine questionnaires were evaluated [72 females, median age 54 years (12-76). Overall, 26 (18%) patients reported dietary items that improved epistaxis (mostly blueberries and red fruits, green vegetables and legumes), while 38 (26%) reported some dietary items that exacerbated epistaxis (spices, chocolate, alcohol, strawberries and ginger). Dietary modifications were reported in up to 58% of cases. In HHT patients, the mean daily iron intake was 8.46 ± 2.78 mg, and no differences were observed in the iron intake of patients reporting a diet modification and those who did not. In the comprehensive management of HHT a healthy and balanced diet, with increased consumption of dietary items with a high iron content, should be encouraged.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

This paper aimed to prospectively evaluate the safety of embolization therapy of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) for the detection of cerebral infarctions by pre- and post-interventional MRI. Method One hundred and five patients (male/female = 44/61; mean age 48.6+/-15.8; range 5-86) with pre-diagnosed PAVMs on contrast-enhanced MRA underwent embolization therapy. The number of PAVMs treated in each patient ranged from 1-8 PAVMs. Depending on the size and localization of the feeding arteries, either Nester-Coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs were used for embolization therapy. cMRI was performed immediately before, and at the 4 h and 3-month post-embolization therapy. Detection of peri-interventional cerebral emboli was performed via T2w and DWI sequences using three different b-values, with calculation of ADC maps. Results Embolization did not show any post-/peri-interventional, newly developed ischemic lesions in the brain. Only one patient who underwent re-embolization and was previously treated with tungsten coils that corroded over time showed newly developed, small, diffuse emboli in the post-interventional DWI sequence. This patient already had several episodes of brain emboli before re-treatment due to the corroded coils, and during treatment, when passing the corroded coils, experienced additional small, clinically inconspicuous brain emboli. However, this complication was anticipated but accepted, since the vessel had to be occluded distally. Conclusion Catheter-based embolization of PAVMs is a safe method for treatment and does not result in clinically inconspicuous cerebral ischemia, which was not demonstrated previously.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4.

33677851	Genetic variants and clinical phenotypes in Korean patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) and Endoglin (ENG) are the principal genes whose mutations cause HHT. A multicenter study to investigate the correlation between genetic variations and clinical outcomes in Korean HHT patients has been lacking. Seventy-two members from 40 families suspected of HHT based on symptoms were genetically screened for pathogenic variants in ACVRL1 and ENG. Patients with genetically diagnosed HHT were also evaluated. In the HHT genetic screening, 42 patients from 24 of the 40 families had genetic variants that met the pathogenic criteria (pathogenic very strong, pathogenic strong, pathogenic moderate, or pathogenic supporting) based on ACMG Standards and Guidelines in either ENG or ACVRL1; 26 from 12 families (50%) in ENG, and 16 from 12 families (50%) in ACVRL1. The diagnostic screening of 42 genetically positive HHT patients based on the Curaçao criteria revealed that 24 patients (57%) were in the definite group, 17 patients (41%) were in the probable group, and 1 patient (2%) was in the unlikely group. Epistaxis was the most common clinical presentation (38/42, 90%), followed by visceral AVMs (24/42, 57%), and telangiectasia (21/42, 50%). Five patients (12%) did not have a family history of HHT clinical symptoms. Among patients having ACVRL1 or ENG genetic variants, only about half of them could be clinically diagnosed as definite HHT, suggesting that genetic screening is important to confirm the diagnosis.	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1.

The purpose of this study is to characterize, clinically and molecularly, 20 prolidase deficient patients of Arab Moslem and Druze origin from 10 kindreds residing in northern Israel. All PD patients manifested developmental delay and facial dysmorphism. Typical PD dermatological symptoms, splenomegaly, and recurrent respiratory infections presented in varying degrees. Two patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and one a novel cystic fibrosis phenotype. Direct DNA sequencing revealed two novel missense mutations, A212P and L368R. In addition, a previously reported S202F mutation was detected in 17 patients from seven Druze and three Arab Moslem kindreds. Patients homozygous for the S202F mutation manifest considerable interfamilial and intrafamilial phenotypic variability. The high prevalence of this mutation among Arab Moslems and Druze residing in northern Israel, and the presence of an identical haplotype along 500,000 bp in patients and their parents, suggests a founder event tracing back to before the breakaway of the Druze from mainstream Moslem society.

Charts were reviewed for a history of infantile spasms (IS), seizure other than IS, refractory epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), anticonvulsant medication use, ages of seizure onset, last seizure, last clinic visit, clinical seizure phenotype(s), cognitive impairment, and genetic mutation. Two hundred ninety-one patients were included. Among these patients, 37.8% had a history of IS; 85.2% had a history of seizure; 54.1% developed multiple seizure types, not including IS; 63.2% had seizure onset in the first year of life; and 12.1% of adults without a seizure history developed epilepsy. Of epilepsy patients, 62.5% developed refractory epilepsy and 33.5% achieved epilepsy remission; 37.5% of these patients achieved medication freedom. IS was a risk factor for refractory epilepsy (p<0.0001) and LGS (p<0.0001). History of seizure, IS, age at seizure onset, and refractory epilepsy each correlated with poor cognitive outcome (p<0.0001). Epilepsy remission correlated with better cognitive outcome (p<0.0001). TSC2 was a risk factor for IS and epilepsy; patients without an identified mutation were more likely to achieve remission. Most patients with TSC develop epilepsy and most develop multiple seizure types. Onset typically occurs in the first year of life; however, adults remain at risk. Although refractory epilepsy is common, many patients achieve seizure control. Many features of seizure history are predictive of cognitive and epilepsy outcome.

20080093	"Corticosteroids correct aberrant CFTR localization in the duct and regenerate acinar cells in autoimmune pancreatitis
"	"Corticosteroids are now widely accepted as a treatment for autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). However, the molecular mechanism by which steroid treatment improves AIP remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate cellular mechanisms by which corticosteroids improve both pancreatic exocrine function and histopathology in AIP. Pancreatic exocrine function was evaluated by the secretin-stimulated function test and pancreatic biopsy specimens were processed for histologic analysis at the time of diagnosis and 3 months after initiation of steroid treatment. Expression and localization of proteins was assayed by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-positive plasma cells was used to verify inflammation in AIP. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells in pancreatic sections was decreased by steroid treatment, indicating reduced inflammation. Fluid, bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)), and digestive enzyme secretions all were impaired in most patients with AIP. Corticosteroids improved both HCO(3)(-) and digestive enzyme secretion. A large fraction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which plays a central role in pancreatic duct HCO(3)(-) secretion, was mislocalized to the cytoplasm of duct cells before treatment. Corticosteroids corrected the localization of CFTR to the apical membrane, accounting for the improved HCO(3)(-) secretion. Steroid treatment resulted in regeneration of acinar cells, accounting for restored digestive enzyme secretion. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and restore both digestive enzyme and HCO(3)(-) secretion in patients with AIP by regenerating acinar cells and correcting CFTR localization in pancreatic duct cells. Mislocalization of CFTR may explain aberrant HCO(3)(-) secretion in other forms of pancreatitis.

20167933	"Prostaglandin E₂regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity and airway surface liquid volume requires gap junctional communication
"	"Stimulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by protease-activated receptors (PARs) at the basolateral membranes and by adenosine receptors (ADO-Rs) at the apical membrane maintain airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, which is required to ensure hydrated and clearable mucus. Both pathways involve the release of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and the stimulation of their basolateral receptors (EP-Rs). We sought to determine whether gap junctions contribute to the coordination of these pathways for modulating CFTR activity and mucus hydration. We used RT-PCR and Western blotting to determine connexin (Cx), CD73, and EP-R expression in a Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line grown on Transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) inserts. We used dye coupling to evaluate gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). We used Ussing chamber studies and X-Z confocal microscopy to monitor Cl(-) secretion and ASL volume regulation. We found that connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated GJIC was increased either by endogenous ADO after the hydrolysis of purine nucleotides by CD73 or by the direct activation of ADO-Rs. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase prevented ADO-dependent increases in GJIC, suggesting the involvement of PGE₂. PGE₂ was found to increase GJIC markedly by stimulating EP4-Rs. The modulation of ADO signaling also affected the PAR-dependent activation of CFTR. The reduction of GJIC by CD73 or Cx43 inhibition prevented PAR-evoked CFTR currents in Ussing chambers. The inhibition of GJIC resulted in a failure of PGE₂ to increase ASL volume in Calu-3 cells and in primary cultures of well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells. Thus, gap junctions coordinate a signaling network comprising CFTR, ADO-Rs, PARs, and EP-Rs, and are required for ASL volume homeostasis.

Recovery to baseline was defined as any FEV(1) in the 3 months after treatment that was greater than or equal to 90% of the baseline FEV(1). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations with the failure to recover to baseline FEV(1). Of 8,479 pulmonary exacerbations, 25% failed to recover to baseline FEV(1). A higher risk of failing to recover to baseline was associated with female sex; pancreatic insufficiency; being undernourished; Medicaid insurance; persistent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; a longer time since baseline spirometric assessment; and a larger drop in FEV(1) from baseline to treatment initiation. For a randomly selected pulmonary exacerbation, 25% of patients' pulmonary function did not recover to baseline after treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

20842588	"New antiepileptic drugs: lacosamide, rufinamide, and vigabatrin
"	"The treatment of epilepsy is complicated by the multiple seizure types and epilepsy syndromes needing therapy. In addition, seizures in up to 30% of epilepsy patients are resistant to available medications. The three newest antiepileptic medications (lacosamide, rufinamide, and vigabatrin) all putatively have novel mechanisms of action, which might increase the chance of treatment success in patients failing previous antiepilepsy drug trials and the chance of successful synergy with currently available medications. In our experience, all three drugs generally are well tolerated, although the risk for serious long-term complications with vigabatrin presents special challenges and precautions. Lacosamide is approved for the adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures in adults and also is available in an intravenous formulation. Rufinamide is a new treatment option for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and although it is not FDA approved for partial seizures, it has shown efficacy for that indication as well. Vigabatrin has been approved in adults for drug-resistant complex partial seizures and in infants as a treatment option for infantile spasms.

20857389	"Barrier properties of gastrointestinal mucus to nanoparticle transport
"	"Gastrointestinal mucus, a complex network of highly branched glycoproteins and macromolecules, is the first barrier through which orally delivered drug and gene vectors must traverse. The diffusion of such vectors can be restricted by the high adhesivity and viscoelasticity of mucus. In this investigation, the barrier properties of gastrointestinal mucus to particle transport were explored using real-time multiple particle tracking. The influence of surface chemistry on particle transport rates was examined using amine-, carboxylate-, and sulfate-modified polystyrene nanoparticles. A strong dependence of particle mobility in gastrointestinal mucus on surface charge was observed, with anionic particles diffusing 20-30 times faster than cationic particles. Comparison of diffusion coefficients calculated for gastrointestinal mucus with significantly varying values previously reported in the literature for other mucus sources, including cervicovaginal mucus and cystic fibrosis sputum, highlight the dependence of mucus barrier properties on the anatomical source. A significant degree of transport rate heterogeneity was also observed in native gastrointestinal mucus, suggesting a highly heterogeneous distribution of pore sizes. Furthermore, the suitability of purified mucin as a model system for transport studies was assessed by comparing particle transport rates between native intestinal mucus and purified porcine gastric mucin. Particle transport rates were approximately threefold lower in native mucus compared to purified mucin for anionic particles, yet comparable for cationic particles. Differences between barrier properties of the purified mucin preparation and native mucus depended on specific carrier properties, indicating that the purified mucin preparation does not provide an accurate model system for native mucus.

"	"Our previous work in a human-fetal trachea xenograft model suggests potential benefits of treating cystic fibrosis in utero. The target for postnatal gene therapy in cystic fibrosis is tracheal submucosal glands (SMGs). The aim of this study was to determine if SMG development in our model recapitulates normal trachea development and its validity for studying fetal gene transfer. Fetal tracheas were divided into developmental phases: early, mid, and late. Fetal tracheas were xenografted onto immunocompromised mice and analyzed for SMG developmental staging and mucopolysaccharide production. There were no significant differences in gland number, size, or density from early through late phase between groups. Xenografted tracheas demonstrated a similar progression through the stages of SMG development as controls after an initial phase shift. Control and xenografted tracheas demonstrated characteristic patterns of acidic mucin production at the base of the SMGs. Fetal trachea xenograft SMG recapitulates normal development and is a valid model for studying human fetal gene transfer. The accessibility of SMG stem cells in early tracheal development may afford a unique window of opportunity for gene transfer. This model has the benefit of providing access to human fetal tracheas in vivo and permits the study of novel fetal gene therapy strategies.

"	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen often associated with chronic lung infections in individuals with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous work from our laboratory revealed that five genes predicted to be important for catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) are induced during in vitro growth in CF lung secretions (sputum). Here, we demonstrate that these genes comprise an operon (referred to as the nag operon) and that NagE, a putative component of the GlcNAc phosphotransferase system, is required for growth on and uptake of GlcNAc. Using primer extension analysis, the promoter of the nag operon was mapped and shown to be inducible by GlcNAc and regulated by the transcriptional regulator NagR. Transcriptome analysis revealed that in addition to induction of the nag operon, several P. aeruginosa genes encoding factors critical for extracellular antimicrobial production are also induced by GlcNAc. Finally, we show that the GlcNAc-containing polymer peptidoglycan induces production of the antimicrobial pyocyanin. Based on this data, we propose a model in which P. aeruginosa senses surrounding bacteria by monitoring exogenous peptidoglycan and responds to this cue through enhanced production of an antimicrobial.

To investigate the antiinflammatory effect of hypertonic saline (HTS) treatment within the CF lung by focusing on IL-8. Degradation of IL-8 in CF lung secretions after treatment with glycosaminoglycan lyases and HTS was analyzed by Western blot analysis and ELISA.

In vivo CF bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) IL-8 levels were significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.05). Digesting glycosaminoglycans in CF BALF displaced IL-8 from glycosaminoglycan matrices, rendering the chemokine susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. High sodium concentrations also liberate IL-8 in CF BALF in vitro, and in vivo in CF sputum from patients receiving aerosolized HTS, resulting in degradation of IL-8 and decreased neutrophil chemotactic efficiency. Glycosaminoglycans possess the ability to influence the chemokine profile of the CF lung by binding and stabilizing IL-8, which promotes neutrophil chemotaxis and activation.

30620050	"Migrainous Infarction in a Patient With Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine and Cystic Fibrosis: A 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT Study
"	"Genetic mutations of sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) are mostly unknown. SHM pathophysiology relies on cortical spreading depression (CSD), which might be responsible for ischemic brain infarction. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a monogenic mutation of the chlorine transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), possibly altering brain excitability. We describe the case of a patient with CF, who had a migrainous stroke during an SHM attack. A 32-year-old Caucasian male was diagnosed with CF, with heterozygotic delta F508/unknown CFTR mutation. The patient experiences bouts of coughing sometimes triggering SHM attacks with visual phosphenes, aphasia, right-sided paresthesia, and hemiparesis. He had a 48-hour hemiparesis triggered by a bout of coughing with hemoptysis, loss of consciousness, and severe hypoxia-hypercapnia. MRI demonstrated transient diffusion hyperintensity in the left frontal-parietal-occipital regions resulting in a permanent infarction in the primary motor area.

"	cystic fibrosis	1.1. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR DISEASE PATHOLOGY		265	"Migrainous Infarction in a Patient With Sporadic Hemiplegic Migraine and Cystic Fibrosis: A 99mTc-HMPAO Brain SPECT Study
. Genetic mutations of sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) are mostly unknown. SHM pathophysiology relies on cortical spreading depression (CSD), which might be responsible for ischemic brain infarction. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a monogenic mutation of the chlorine transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), possibly altering brain excitability. We describe the case of a patient with CF, who had a migrainous stroke during an SHM attack. A 32-year-old Caucasian male was diagnosed with CF, with heterozygotic delta F508/unknown CFTR mutation. The patient experiences bouts of coughing sometimes triggering SHM attacks with visual phosphenes, aphasia, right-sided paresthesia, and hemiparesis. He had a 48-hour hemiparesis triggered by a bout of coughing with hemoptysis, loss of consciousness, and severe hypoxia-hypercapnia. MRI demonstrated transient diffusion hyperintensity in the left frontal-parietal-occipital regions resulting in a permanent infarction in the primary motor area. Later, a brain perfusion SPECT showed persistent diffuse hypoperfusion in the territories involved in diffusion-weighted imaging alteration. Migrainous infarction, depending on the co-occurrence of 2 strictly related phenomena, CSD and hypoxia, appears to be the most plausible explanation.

"	"To verify the association between quality of life, functional capacity and clinical and nutritional status in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). Cross-sectional study, including patients from eight to 18 years old with CF. Quality of life, functional capacity, nutritional status and clinical status were evaluated with the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire; the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and manual gripping force (MGF); the height percentiles for age and body mass index for age and respiratory function test, respectively. Pearson and Spearman correlation tests and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. A total of 45 patients, 13.4±0.5 years old, 60% female, 60% colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 57.8% with at least one F508del mutation participated in the study. When assessing the perception of quality of life, the weight domain reached the lowest values, and the digestive domain, the highest. In the pulmonary function test, the forced expiratory volume of the first second was 77.3±3.3% and the 6MWT and MGF presented values within the normal range. There was an association between quality of life and functional capacity, nutritional status and clinical status of CF patients. The study participants had good clinical conditions and satisfactory values of functional capacity and quality of life. The findings reinforce that the assessment of quality of life may be important for clinical practice in the management of treatment.

Retrospective case-control study. Paranasal sinuses CT scans of 103 CF adult patients with CRS were compared to those belonging to a cohort of 100 non-CF adult patients to explore their anatomical differences. Secondly, CF and non-CF patients who received primary/revision ESS were analyzed in order to assess their preoperative CT scan in terms of surgically relevant variants, and according to the CLOSE checklist. Surgical outcomes were statistically compared in order to explore the differences between groups. CF group presented more frequently with smaller and less pneumatized paranasal sinuses and a higher Lund-Mckay score compared with controls. No anatomical differences emerged in terms of genotype stratification. Non-CF CRS patients undergoing ESS showed a significantly deeper olfactory fossa and a more frequent supraorbital pneumatization compared to CF patients (P < .001 and P = .031, respectively). Whereas this latter group underwent more often aggressive surgical procedures (P = .001), no difference in terms of postoperative adverse events was found (P = .620). Despite receiving more often aggressive ESS procedures, adult CF patients do not show an increased risk of postoperative complication and this may be linked to a different proportion of anatomical and surgically-relevant variants. 4 Laryngoscope, 2021.

31360828	"Topically Applied Etamsylate: A New Orphan Drug for HHT-Derived Epistaxis (Antiangiogenesis through FGF Pathway Inhibition)
"	"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks.

"	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	3.4. PATIENT-BASED THERAPEUTICS		303	"Topically Applied Etamsylate: A New Orphan Drug for HHT-Derived Epistaxis (Antiangiogenesis through FGF Pathway Inhibition)
. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia characterized by recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis (nose bleeds), telangiectases on skin and mucosa, internal organ arteriovenous malformations, and dominant autosomal inheritance. Mutations in Endoglin and ACVRL1 / ALK1 , genes mainly expressed in endothelium, are responsible in 90% of the cases for the pathology. These genes are involved in the transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) signaling pathway. Epistaxis remains as one of the most common symptoms impairing the quality of life of patients, becoming life-threatening in some cases. Different strategies have been used to decrease nose bleeds, among them is antiangiogenesis. The two main angiogenic pathways in endothelial cells depend on vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The present work has used etamsylate, the diethylamine salt of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate anion, also known as dobesilate, as a FGF signaling inhibitor. In endothelial cells, in vitro experiments show that etamsylate acts as an antiangiogenic factor, inhibiting wound healing and matrigel tubulogenesis. Moreover, etamsylate decreases phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. A pilot clinical trial (EudraCT: 2016-003982-24) was performed with 12 HHT patients using a topical spray of etamsylate twice a day for 4 weeks. The epistaxis severity score (HHT-ESS) and other pertinent parameters were registered in the clinical trial. The significant reduction in the ESS scale, together with the lack of significant side effects, allowed the designation of topical etamsylate as a new orphan drug for epistaxis in HHT (EMA/OD/135/18).

"	"This study aimed to investigate the general presentation of epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia (ESwoH) and retrospectively determine whether there are differences in treatment effects related to ACTH therapy, long-term seizure outcome, and evolution of EEG features according to pre-treatment EEG patterns. According to the pattern of background activity, we divided our cohort into two groups: Group 1: normal background activity or with localized intermittent slow waves; Group 2: intermittent slow waves appearing generalized or in two or more lobes. Subjects included 22 children (Group 1: n=10; Group 2: n=12) diagnosed with ESwoH who received treatment from 2007 to 2017. The median age at onset of epileptic spasms was 5.5 months and the follow-up period lasted for 40.5 months. ACTH therapy was performed for seven patients from Group 1 and eight patients from Group 2. Only one patient from Group 2 responded to ACTH. Patients receiving effective treatments at early stages had excellent seizure outcome. Refractory cases included six patients in Group 1 and eight patients in Group 2; subsequent follow-up EEGs indicated hypsarrhythmia in one patient in Group 1 (17%) and six patients (75%) in Group 2, including one patient whose EEG pattern indicated progression to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, ACTH is ineffective for patients with epileptic spasms without hypsarrhythmia. The EEG may indicate possible future development of hypsarrhythmia if epileptic spasms are resistant to treatment, especially in patients with diffuse slow waves on pre-treatment EEG. The efficacy of treatment introduced at early stages from onset may predict long-term seizure outcome.

Among patients with GI disease, those with hemoglobin < 8 g/dL or transfusion requirements (65.7%) were older and had higher epistaxis severity score (ESS) and larger telangiectases (>3 mm). After a mean follow-up of 34.2 months, patients with GI involvement required more transfusions and more emergency department and hospital admissions, with no differences in mortality. Risk factors for GI involvement have been identified. Patients with GI involvement and severe anemia had larger telangiectases and higher ESS. VCE should be considered in patients with suspicion of GI bleeding, even if EGD is normal.

The patient with a potentially novel mutation showed developmental delay, intractable seizures, and mild cerebral atrophy on MRI, but the severity of symptoms was milder than in the former two cases. Electrophysiological study using HEK293T cells demonstrated significant changes of T-type Ca2+ currents by p.Ala961Thr and p.Met1531Val SNVs, which were likely to enhance oscillation of membrane potential at low frequencies. In contrast, p.Ile1273Phe showed no significant effects in our electrophysiological evaluations, with its pathogenesis remaining undetermined.

33498134	"Novel Protein Interactions with Endoglin and Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1: Potential Role in Vascular Networks.
"	"Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.
"	hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	2.1. DISEASE MECHANISM		271	"Novel Protein Interactions with Endoglin and Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1: Potential Role in Vascular Networks.
. Endoglin and activin receptor-like kinase 1 are specialized transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily receptors, primarily expressed in endothelial cells. Mutations in the corresponding ENG or ACVRL1 genes lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1 and HHT2 respectively). To discover proteins interacting with endoglin, ACVRL1 and TGF-β receptor type 2 and involved in TGF-β signaling, we applied LUMIER, a high-throughput mammalian interactome mapping technology. Using stringent criteria, we identified 181 novel unique and shared interactions with ACVRL1, TGF-β receptor type 2, and endoglin, defining potential novel important vascular networks. In particular, the regulatory subunit B-beta of the protein phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R2B) interacted with all three receptors. Interestingly, the PPP2R2B gene lies in an interval in linkage disequilibrium with HHT3, for which the gene remains unidentified. We show that PPP2R2B protein interacts with the ACVRL1/TGFBR2/endoglin complex and recruits PP2A to nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Endoglin overexpression in endothelial cells inhibits the association of PPP2R2B with NOS3, whereas endoglin-deficient cells show enhanced PP2A-NOS3 interaction and lower levels of endogenous NOS3 Serine 1177 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that endoglin regulates NOS3 activation status by regulating PPP2R2B access to NOS3, and that PPP2R2B might be the HHT3 gene. Furthermore, endoglin and ACVRL1 contribute to several novel networks, including TGF-β dependent and independent ones, critical for vascular function and potentially defective in HHT.

The aim of our study was to determine the impact of simple advice provided by the pediatrician on the smoking habits of parents of children with cystic fibrosis (CF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Parents were interviewed on their smoking habits. Smoking cessation advice was provided by the pediatrician. A new smoking habits assessment was done at 3 months by phone interviews. A total of 260 parents were interviewed (91 in the CF group, 136 in the DM group, and 33 in the bronchiolitis group). A total of 70 parents were active smokers: 33% of parents of children with CF, 23.5% of parents of children with DM, and 24.2% for those with infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis (p = .42). In the CF group, smoking cessation had been significantly more frequently discussed with the medical team previously. A total of 67 smoking parents (95.7%) answered the 3-month assessment: 29.8% reported having started a smoking cessation process; 10.4% had quit smoking. The quitting rate was significantly higher in the groups of patients followed for a respiratory disorder (37.5% for bronchiolitis, 15% for CF vs. 0% for DM, p = .005).

We identified 14 mutations in 14 genes as causes of LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. 64 percent of the identified genes were reported as LGS or epilepsy-related genes. Many of these variations were novel and considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Network analysis was performed to classify the identified genes into two network clusters: neuronal signal transmission or neuronal development. Additionally, knockdown of two candidate genes with insufficient evidence of neuronal functions, SLC25A39 and TBC1D8, decreased neurite outgrowth and the expression level of MAP2, a neuronal marker.

Statistical analysis comparing the 2 equations sets were stratified by sex. 4180 tests were included. GLI-2017 z-scores of the 3 DLCO indices of the controls (n = 150) are nearer to 0 (expected value in a normal population) than ECSC-93 z-scores. All groups combined, in both genders, DLCO GLI-2017 z-scores and %predicted are significantly higher than ECSC z-scores and %predicted. In the ILD group, differences between the 2 equation sets depend on the DLCO impairment severity: GLI-2017 z-scores are higher than ECSC z-scores in patients with no or ""mild"" decrease in DLCO, but are lower in ""moderate"" or ""severe"" decrease. GLI-2017 reference values for DLCO are more suitable to our population and influence the diagnostic criteria and severity definition of several lung diseases.

33626436	"The efficacy and tolerability of auto-stimulation-VNS in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
"	"Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) of childhood. The Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) is established as a safe and effective treatment for DRE. This study assesses efficacy and tolerability of the auto-stimulation VNS models in pediatric patients with LGS. This is a retrospective chart review of a cohort of pediatric patients (Age 1-18 years old) with LGS implanted with an auto-stimulation VNS model at a single level four pediatric epilepsy center. Patient responder's rate was measured as seizure reduction over baseline and improvements in five quality-of-life measures as reported by the patients and families. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline. This cohort includes 71 consecutive children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent implantation with one of two models of the auto-stimulation VNS. The average age of the children at implantation was 20.82 months. Of those patients, 55 % of patients achieved greater than 50 % seizure reduction at six months, 67.7 % at 12 months, and 65 % at 24 months. At 12 months 11 % of the patients were completely seizure free and at 24 months 17 % were seizure free. By 24 months post implantation most of the patient families reported at least a 50 % improvement rate in one or more of the quality-of-life measures. The most commonly reported adverse events were dysphonia, paresthesia, and shortness of breath, all of which were tolerated and subsided by 24 months. This study provides evidence that VNS models with the auto-stimulation paradigm based on detection of tachycardia are well tolerated and effective in a pediatric population with LGS. Furthermore, this study shows that for this population, the auto-stimulation models of the VNS may provide additional benefits over the earlier VNS versions.

Annual mortality data for the 1999-2017 period were extracted from the Brazilian National Ministry of Health Mortality Database. All death certificates in which category E84 (CF) of the ICD-10, was listed as an underlying or associated cause of death were selected. Epidemiological and clinical data were described, and standardized mortality rates were calculated per year and for the 2000-2017 period. A joinpoint regression analysis was performed to detect changes in the mortality rates during the study period. Overall, 2,854 CF-related deaths were identified during the study period, ranging from 68 in 1999 to 289 in 2017. CF was the underlying cause of death in 83.5% of the death certificates. A continuous upward trend in the death rates was observed, with a significant annual percent change of 6.84% (5.3-8.4%) among males and 7.50% (6.6-8.4%) among females. The median age at death increased from 7.5 years in 1999 to 56.5 years in 2017. Diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 77% of the associated causes in the death certificates that reported CF as the underlying cause of death. A significant and continuous increase in CF-related death rates was found in Brazil in the last years, as well as a concurrent increase in the median age at death.

"	"It is often difficult to diagnose epilepsy syndromes in resource-limited settings.** This study was aimed to investigate the prospect of ascertaining the diagnosis, clinical profile, and treatment outcomes of epilepsy syndromes (ESs) among children in a resource-limited setting**. This was a** descriptive study** done from 01/07/2009 to 15/06/2017 among children (1-17 years of age) with unprovoked seizures presenting to the pediatric neurology clinic of a university hospital in eastern Nepal. Diagnosis, classification, and treatment of seizures were based upon International League Against Epilepsy guidelines. Of 768 children with unprovoked seizures, 120 (15.6%) were diagnosed as ES. The age of onset of seizure was unique for each ES. Developmental delay and cerebral palsy were present in 47.5% and 28.3% children, respectively. Common ESs were West syndrome (WS)-26.7%, generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCSA)-21.7%, self-limited childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLCECTS)-12.5%, childhood absence epilepsy (CAE)-10.0%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS)-10.0%, other developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE)-5.8%, self-limited familial infantile epilepsy (SLFIE)-4.2%, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)-3.3%. Among children with known outcomes (87/120), overall response to pharmacotherapy and to monotherapy was observed in 72.4% (63/87) and 57.5% (50/87) children, respectively. All children with GTCSA, SLFIE, genetic epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+), CAE, SLCECTS, and JME responded to pharmacotherapy and they had normal computerized tomography scans of the brain. Seizures were largely pharmaco-resistant in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME)-100.0%, LGS-73.0%, WS-52.0%, and other DEEs-40%. A reasonable proportion (15.6%) of unprovoked seizures could be classified into specific ES despite limited diagnostic resources. WS was the most common ES. GTCSA, SLCECTS, CAE, and LGS were other common ESs. GTCSA, SLFIE, CAE, SLCECTS, GEFS+, and JME were largely pharmaco-responsive. PME, WS, and LGS were relatively pharmaco-resistant. Electro-clinical diagnosis of certain ES avoids the necessity of neuroimaging.

33764203	"Evolution of Infantile Spasms to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: What Is There to Know?
"	"Children with infantile spasms may develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are vague, and many experts use varying combinations of the following criteria for diagnosis: paroxysmal fast activity on electroencephalography (EEG), slow spike and wave on EEG, developmental delay, multiple seizure types, and nocturnal tonic seizures. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a high-risk cohort of children with a history of infantile spasms and the characteristics of infantile spasms that were associated with the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Children with infantile spasms who were diagnosed and treated at Children's Hospital Colorado between 2012 and 2018 were included. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was defined as having 3 of 5 of the following characteristics: paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike and wave, current developmental delay, multiple seizure types, or tonic seizures. Descriptive statistics were performed using median and interquartile range. Univariable analysis was performed with Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Ninety-seven children met inclusion criteria, and 36% (35/97) met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Developmental delay and history of seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms were identified as risk factors for the development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .003) as was poor response to first treatment for spasms (P = .004). Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .019). Eighty percent (28/35) of the children who met Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria lacked a documented diagnosis. Thirty-six percent of children with infantile spasms met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Risk factors for development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were developmental delay and seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms and poor response to first treatment for infantile spasms. Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eighty percent of the children who met our criteria were not given a documented diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which highlights the fact that many children may not be receiving a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We recommend establishing clear guidelines for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to ensure that the diagnosis is being made accurately.
